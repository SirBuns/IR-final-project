# IR-final-project

We creat some files which are bigger than 100MB so we can't upload them to github. However, we do have functions in our code to crate the needed file. What you need to do is change the "Constants" file so the constants match what you have on your computer and to run the function "create_catagory_files_json" one. This function is located in the "CIndexer" file.
