Yahoo Answers is solely dedicated to asking and answering questions.  If you read the community guidelines they strickly prohibit asking questions in an attempt to chat or have discussions with other members.You can't. If you want to create a group, you can use the Yahoo! Groups service at http://groups.yahoo.com

Because the program is still in beta.  To suggest such a feature, click the 'Feedback' link in the top right corner--they may add such a list, but the problem is that it might, also, encourage people to just start forcing their ratings (and their friends) higher, to get onto the list.  It might be more trouble than it's worth.because Yahoo has control issues...
To shut off programs that start when your PC starts click on the start button, then click run, then in the box type msconfig.

This has been a minor 'bug' in Yahoo Mail for some time now (at least 4 or 5 years). The alert will periodically detect a message that has already been opened, filed, or discarded. Not much that you can really do about it, but it's one of the main reasons why I stopped using mail alert programs like the old Yahoo Companion, which I believe has since been integrated into the Yahoo anti-spyware toolbar.If you have alot of messages on your inbox already that you've read, then you might have to scroll down and check every page because it might have been sent a long time ago and it just got to you.
Make sure you aren't signed up to the group twice. You may have accidentally signed up using two different Yahoo! profiles. Then contact the administrator to see if he can get it fixed if there's anything wrong with the group's mailing system.Contact the admin for that group and let them know.  Some software's used for such mailing can have bugs too.
You could always leave a comment in the comment box thanking them. People usually come back after you rate their answer as best-answer, and then they'll ofcourse give it a thumbs up for more points and see a comment and most likely read it!No option till now.May be yahoo will incorporate it at a later stage.Send them a email =D
The phone number is NOT available for free Yahoo! services, so they will not help you if you call. It's possible to get it reactivated if you email them and are persistent about it, but don't get your hopes up.call their customer care number and ask:.  (408) 349-5070
Your computer connection is probably not allowing you to sign in. But first try creating a new profile using the link below and see if you can sign in with the new name. Otherwise, you may have to go to the Yahoo! messenger website and click the link at the bottom of the screen to launch their web-based messenger.If you have problems with yahoo messanger then first you can try www.meebo.com, it is a script based yahoo messanger. Works with latest versions of firefox. Yahoo online chat applet requires java and a bit slow, meebo is better than that.. . If you have proxies enabled, then you have to do something else, edit proxy settings in yahoo meeanger. . ------------------------------.

you need to delete cookies, files and clear history.  or if not try to use another browser.The connection may have timed out. If you have extra programs running on your computer that you don't need, turn them off so your computer will have more memory (RAM) to load the page.
In Outlook you can chhose to have a receipt sent back to you when your email is read but the reader can override this and not allow it to be sent. Another more complicated way is to use a "web bug". This is when you embed an image in the email. If you host the image on your web server you will see the request in your logs when the email is opened.use read receipts in outlook.You could also try http://www.didtheyreadit.com, however this is easy for someone to work around if they want to avoid you knowing they read the email.
You only can change it by signing up to a new Yahoo account. But you can also subscribe to Yahoo Mail Plus account which is $19.95/year and then you can have unlimited additional disposable e-mail addresses.You can't change your email ID. Only alternate is to create a new email ID.. . Peace
I think most questions/answers are deleted due to abuse reports submitted by other users.  So if someone was offended by whatever you posted, it got deleted.  If no one complained about the "how to kill" post, chances are nothing might happen.Why do people ask to be millionaires?Probably because it's his/her idea of a joke. Or maybe he/she is bored and wants to do something.
In Internet Explorer go to the Tools Tab and go down to Internet Options. From there click on the Content Tab and click on the Auto Complete button. Click the Clear Forms button. Then click on Ok and the search history has been erased.http://help.yahoo.com/help/us/ysearch/basics/basics-25.html

If you would like to uninstall the feature.  Go to your control panel, click add/remove programs, find Yahoo Toolbar and click remove program.open messenger, click on the top left tab, messenger- preferences- alerts and sounds- there you can make any changes that u wish to suit your needs..
I assume you're talking about the drop down menu that shows up when you type in the search field in Internet Explorer. To delete that information, open Internet Explorer, click on Tools then Internet Options, then on the Content tab, and on the Auto Complete button. There, you can clear forms, which would delete all of those items in the drop down. You can also unselect the check box next to forms and Internet Explorer will stop saving anything you type in a form.reformat your pcIf you click on 'tools - internet options - settings - view files' then highlight everything in this list and hit the 'delete' key (not the backspace key) then this should hopefully work.delete your temporary internet files/ cookies and history.. >click start, control panel, internet optionsclick on the search box until  the search items will appear.  then press the delete  key of your keyboard.
If someone reports abuse and Yahoo finds the justification valid, they will remove it and maybe someday even delist memebers once this portal gets popular. I think what Yahoo is doing is great and this is one of the best ways to fine tune Yahoo answerswell.. it never happened with me. . but.. the type of questions u r asking .. it seems... . illegal drug use - hmm i dunno if they shld keep such question.. . multiple postings - other users must have posted the same question (plss search if its asked before .. before posting) .. makes sense.. . one removed fro vagueness - could u share the question. cant really comment before knowing it.. . insulting yahoo - hello u cant insult yahoo! :). . Lets try and make this a better place :)i had one of my answers removed too!. . well yahoo removes the questions or answers only if somebody reports it as "report abuse".. . so its the community who reports and then yahoo takes a neutral decision!. . its probably all got to do with keeping this community clean!
Make sure your caps lock key isn't on.  Passwords are case sensitive.What error message are you getting?im not sure sorry
I do like this new point system more than the last one because it allows me to answer more questions. Before this new point system was implemented, I always used up all the "answers" I could, but didn't ask that many questions. With this new point system, I can answer twice as many questions, rate more answers, and choose more best answers. It gives me more of a chance to spread my knowledge to other people, who desire it.yes, I do. I've had questions close within minutes, while I was trying to answer them. I sometimes write some pretty long answers, and I don't like having the question close to gain points while I'm working it.
If you mean pc to pc, it would be just like sending an IM invitation, but with voice.. . But if you mean their new beta service, I think you have to get their YM beta version first, then apply for the service you want.Don't vote for my answer. The above answer looks fair. . No further answer is needed, but a second answer is the only way to close the question.
Well, from what I've been trying to determine, they seem to pick questions that are well worded (e.g. good punctuation, sentence structure, grammar) that are short and concise. The questions they pick also tend to be interesting for the most people; like they wouldn't pick "What is Hillary Duff's best song?". Their featured questions have covered a broad range of topics, so I think that if what you post fits the above criteria, you should be able to get a featured question in any category.I asked the same question before, and someone from the Yahoo Answers team told me that the staff just picks out questions they feel are interesting and will generate more than one answer.
Hold down the "CONTROLL" key and click on the link.  This will bypass the Popup blocker in Windows.Hold down Ctrl on the keyboard when you click a link to allow popups. For the most part the blockers are good to have.
Depends on which service you are using. Most chat services require that you are the host of the chatroom. If you made the chatroom then you are the host. Some services dont allow you to boot someone off the chatroom, like AIM.:)Just click on the X in the upper right of the window! In fact, maybe you should do that right now.That may depend on your reason to boot someone out.  Review the "terms of service" and look for serious violations like copyright violation of your material or impostor (where you are the victim).  Yahoo! maintains a comprehensive set of terms that we must all follow here and they welcome ligitimate (but not trivial) complaints.
I think this has the potential to create either a truly enlightened group or a horribly misinformed populace. :-)the best!The best message board site on the web
On the Yahoo Answers page, click on the link of your Yahoo ID.  You will get a summary of your points and how you obtained them.For now you can see only the 6 latest sources of your points. You can see them by clicking this link. http://answers.yahoo.com/my/my
For security reasons. Yes, it's sometimes inconvenient, but I'm sure Yahoo wouldn't make you do this for no real reason. But lastly, did you know that you can change the log-on interval via your profile? I set mine to daily checking and that works for me.So that you can access Yahoo
You can't add text, but click on "Apparel", then select your own "top" and "bottom".  :-)scroll up then youll see a long box (hello...points...level...) click on your name and by your picture you will see some thing that says edit my info and you click on it and put what ever info you want in it.
it may be a internal problem or registy error. try restarting your computer. or reinstall yahoo mssgerDownload the latest version of yahoo meessenger and even that doesnt work then reinstall your windows xp
Because there are health questions, and there are silly questions where the poster only wants to talk about sex and/or get turned on, which in the end only undermines the whole credibility of Yahoo! Answers.. . There are thousands of forums for sex talk, I am sure people who want to have some fun can find one that will suit their tastes.. . Also, some users, like myself, report abuse when we see it...Because they're repressed fascists who don't understand the internet, &/or are trying to appease same. <3
uninstall!  check your add/ remove programs.  actually its there.See the link below for lots of solutions.If your version of Windows has System Rollback, use that.. Otherwise if you have a backup before you installed those, restore it from your backup disks.:)
Under tools on IE, click Options. Click clear history.Under tools on IE, click Options. Click clear history. . rthats the easiest way to do this for IE nd for firefox go to options and delete the historyFollow the chain (View is next to the File and Edit):. View > Privacy Report > Settings > General > Clear History
Maybe they thought that the question wasn't written clearly? I noticed they tend to delete questions that are addressed to specific people, so maybe since your question said "Why are you still using IE" they took it as one of those questions. I think it would be ok if you asked "What's better, IE or Firefox?"Don't vote for my answer. The above answer is correct. . No further answer is needed, but a second answer is the only way to close the question.
I.E. is a little flakey when it comes to those icons.  These "shortcut icons" are sometimes refered to as favicons.  I wouldn't worry about it.Is the logo the only thing that isn't showing? Maybe they had problems and it was temporarily down while you were viewing it. It should be working for you now.
If you are trying to check your mail from an external source, then I would download a free client called YahooPOPS, which will retrieve your email and deliver it to all major mail applications. They include detailed tutorials on how to configure it.You would need to use two differens browsers.. Microsoft would not open two accounts at the same time on the same computer. The other option is to use two different computers.. But I presume, that you meant on the same computer.Yeah, Microsoft would open both accounts, all you had to do on the second window is sign out and waa-laa you have your previous account still open in the first window and now you can sign into your second oneOpen two windows buddy ...that's all...open to windows and sign in with 2 different accounts...Download Trillian. It is similiar to Yahoo! messenger but can handle more than one account simultaneously.Use different browsers for each account, for example Internet Explorer and Firefox.
In Internet Explorer go to the Tools Tab and go down to Internet Options. From there click on the Content Tab and click on the Auto Complete button. Click the Clear Forms button. Then click on Ok and the search history has been erased.it's helpful don't get rid of it.  when you least expect it you'll need it. that's what happened to me.What operating system and browser?  I am guessing Windows XP and Internet Explorer?use your right click, i do it all the time
It's a question a lot of kids have asked their parents and never received a satisfactory answer. I wouldn't worry about it too much.because they're trying to gain points quickly here.because people are desperate for points and they'll ask anything in order to get them.... . . Kinda like someone asking "Am I hungry?"They don't read questions and probably don't have something smart to ask!Because they don't know why the sky is blue.
I'm not sure if you can. Try creating a new chat and invite everyone but the person you don't want in there.the easiest way is to send them an im with an attached spike file
Forward the e-mails you want to keep to the primary e-mail account you are going to use... I have had to do that everytime I have switched e-mails.Two solutions:. . Set up MSN to forward your emails to your Yahoo account.  I'm not sure if you have to pay extra for that MSN feature.. . Switch to Yahoo Mail Plus and you will get POP access.  Make sure you have MSN set up so you can have POP access there (may be an additional charge) and use Yahoo to pull from your Hotmail/MSN accounts.Set up a microwave it will helpGenerally in Unix systems you would have to create a file with .forward and in the file type the email address/es to which you want to forward.. . I think Hotmail does not give this option. But as it is pop3 server, you might be able to use this service.. . http://www.email-forwarding.biz/
If you are using Windows XP, go to Start>Control panel>Add/Remove Programs.  Then select Yahoo Messenger from the list (usually towards the bottom) and select Change/Remove to uninstall it.I don't know.
When the auto-fill choice pops up, right-click on it and choose to delete. It will delete just that one choice.you can't removed "subject" in the compose mail because that is a default field already, however you can leave it empty or you can choose not to provide the subject in the subject field when you send an email...
Norton Personal Firewall blocks out any adverts in your browser window. Its pretty basic and seems to block 99.9% of em.buy XM Radio. It's great. Not one advertisment.The only problem with Norton and similar tools is that they also block legitimate stuff and you are forever tweaking to make them work . As example, the Yahoo Map Beta will not work with Norton in its default configuration.
There may be something temporarily wrong with the server. Just try again later.Timing out?  Just enter your URL in the box, really not rocket science.
Probably. It would be easier if you were both on Yahoo or both on AOL.You might be behind a too restrictive firewall.
you have to go to internet options, click on the "Content" tag, and select "Autocomplete".. There you should see two boxes, one that says clear forms and another that says clear passwords.

Yahoo Answers is different from message boards and online groups because you cannot have conversations, make announcements, post photos, etc.  This web application utilizes a particular format to specifically ask, answer, and rate questions.In BB(message boards) is more like discussing out a answer to a question, but at Y! Answer u give the answers is correct according to u...
something is diffently wrong worm or virus other mail is quick?. G-RobCheck if your system has been infected with any virus or spyware
if you're using the sbc yahoo browser, go to Tools and Browser Options. You can clear the address history from there. Otherwise, if you're using the internet explorer or firefox, try downloading CCleaner. It's a great program that deletes the internet history, tracking cookies, and any other stuff you want to delete from your internet history.First go into your folder options and make sure you can view all files (including hidden.  Then go to your local drive, documents and settings, user (whoever you are set up as on XP), local settings, history, select all and delete.
A server (not necessarily a Web server) is acting as a gateway or proxy to fulfil the request by the client (e.g. your Web browser or our CheckUpDown robot) to access the requested URL. This server did not receive a timely response from an upstream server it accessed to deal with your HTTP request.. . This usually means that the upstream server is down (no response to the gateway/proxy), rather than that the upstream server and the gateway/proxy do not agree on the protocol for exchanging data.The above answer is absolutely correct. Try restarting your browswer or checking back later.
"Control Panel", "Add Remove Programs"  Find it near or at the bottom of the list, uninstall it.. . Also, setup a free Yahoo e-mail account and it will go with you no matter what ISP you use.  I've had mine for over a decade.or on the top of your web brower screen you will see the words file, edit, view, etc. go to wview, go down to toolbars go to yahoo toolbar there should be a check next to it click on yahoo toolbar(the words) to make it go away
click view, then character encoding. then pick the chinese coding.. should be ok,Don't vote for my answer. The above answer looks reasonable. . No further answer is needed, but a second answer is the only way to close the question.
Look in Trash folder.  If it is not there, you can't.Sorry but once deleted, you cannot get it backIf it's not in your "Trash" on yahoo then you're not getting it back!
it depends how sincerely you submit your question. if you are true and fair in your approach, then, yahoo answer will be of great use to you.It can vary frm person to person. If you get nice answers it is useful for youCackles.
Without using some external (non-Yahoo) tracking software, Yahoo!

There must be a SBC Global DSL Tower within 5 miles of your house. So your neighbor could have and you might be a few feet further and not be eligible. That happened to me.Go to here:. . http://help.sbcglobal.net/article.php?item=287Go to: help.sbcglobal.net or if you need further assistance, contact SBC..1-877-722-3577.All the other people were wrong. If you have SBC Mail, that means yolu have SBC Yahoo DSL. And you don't get that from your neighbor unless he has it connected through a wireless router but that still wouldn't give you SBC Mail. To sign into the SBC Mail, make sure you are not signed into any yahoo accounts at the time. Then go to sbc.yahoo.com. And sign in. When it askes for your user ID, please add  @sbcglobal.net after your user name, and then type your password. You should see a link for mail or if not go to yahoo.com and click mail. It will be you SBC Mail.
No sure-fire way to find them all. Best bet is to check regional chatrooms, or search for Location in the profile. Obvioulsy, you will find plenty of Indian teens and Philina 20-somethings in the room, as well as many people not giving the location, or giving a false one.Don't vote for my answer. The above answer is correct. . No further answer is needed, but a second answer is the only way to close the question.
They do it because some of the content can be "mature" in nature and they want to make sure the audience is of legal age to view/participate in it. While they have age restrictions in place, they're by no means fool proof.I don't believe that they do that... I'm under eightteen and am on it.
Because most people are asking questions for points rather than because they were unable to find it using a quick keyword search on Yahoo. That or all of their fingers are broken and they can't use the search button on Yahoo Answers. OR they're just too damn lazy!The word has spread, and many just want the Points.  you can tell by some of the comon sense questions that are asked, not every one is that dumb.. I don't even try to answer the stupid ones..nobody knows anything?
perhaps you should make the connection that it's not the compose or delete or search features that are the problem, it's the buttons.  Have you noticed that links work fine, but buttons do not.  You need to make sure that you have Javascript turned on, it handles buttons, HTML handles links.Try downloading Firefox. Its much better than IE, with less bugs.
Click on your name to go to your profile page.  On the profile page, there is a link marked "Edit My Info" that will take you to a page where you can select a photo from your Yahoo! 360 page or your IM avatar.  I believe the link below should take you straight to the profile edit page.Yes...I would like an answer to that one as well. "D"on you profile(not the one on yahoo answers the one from  yahoo profiles) there has to be a place that says create ur own avatar or click on top of the place where the picture goes . something like that. i hope i didn't make that complicated...
Because Yahoo Mail's free service is just that - *free*. Since you are not paying to use their basic service, Yahoo in turn does not allocate any human resources toward customer service, unless in rare instances it's a problem that they feel needs to be addressed immediately.. . If you like to have the luxury of 24/7 technical support, you're going to have to pay for that and you could always consider upgrading to Mail Plus for a nominal annual fee.Because there is no money in it for the provider.It costs lots to hire people, buy phones, and build a 24-hour help hotline for your e-mail service. Yet, you don't earn money from your e-mail service in return. No one will be that stupid to waste your money on building a free e-mail service!Duh, though u do say it urself; it's nearly, but not impossible;>mojo
It's actually "YPager.exe -kill", this is used to forcefully unload yahoo messenger without user intervention.. . Peace'kill' just means that it will shut down the program.
Good grief!. 3 months and only 1 answer - AND no further response from Asker.. . Let's VOTE #1, and get this (weird!) Question into "Resolved".I really think you should check to see if you actually have the e-mail address typed EXACTLY. I am guessing that even a gap in the e-mail addy may not allow it to be recognized by the Yahoo program that loads it in your address book, or applies it to the mail you are trying to address. It may also be the by-product of a virus that so many address books (and your friends) are harmed by.
You must ask for permision via the instant message window or via the buddy list Contact Options.. . If you are wanting to view some ones webcam with out their permision, you cant. You can view as anonymous via several programs readily available.Sit on his computer... Besides that, u cant
There is currently no known way to "cancel" your Yahoo 360° account.. . Currently the only option is to "hide" your information by setting all the account options to "private" (and, if you have 'friends' on your account, remove them because it's not currently possible to hide the friends list).if u cancel or delete your yahoo account , automatically all services with that yahood id will be deleted ...and no more u will be able to access 360 service from yahoo !
1) go to yahoo mail. 2) options. 3) signatures. 4) input your signatureIf you are using an upgraded Yahoo mail then you have to just type the signature in the box above where is says check here to use signature. After putting it in it stays there and you check or un-check as needed.go to yahoo... click on mail... then in the right hand corner, you'll see -Options- click on that... then scroll down and you'll see -Signature- click on that and be creative
Because your email inbox sorts by the date stamp on the email and the person sending the email has an incorrect date on thier computer, so the date stamp on the email that goes out has an old date on it. When you get it, your inbox thinks it is old because of the old date.You can sort the incoming messages either on top of old messages or at the bottom in Options.  But yeah, due to the reasons mentioned in the previous answer, sometimes there can be a mishmash...
Messenger uses up a lot of memory (RAM) on your computer. Try setting it to not archive your messages, and be sure not to have any programs running on your computer if you don't need them.you have too many files, go to control panel then internet options then hit delete filesthat should fix your problem.
There was a site a couple years ago that did the same thing as this, but you had more time on the questions and you could communicate with the person who sent it or answered it if needed.  You could also win prizes and other gifts.  I don't remember the name of it right off hand, but it closed with the statement that they were too far ahead of their time, and they hoped that someone like Yahoo would pick up the idea and give it a rebirth.  If I could find one of my gifts I could tell you the name of the site, but since it is gone now I don't think it will help.girl, he said it all
If you used the new Yahoo! Mail before, there was a link at the top of your mail page that you clicked on to get back to the old version. In that same place should be the new button to switch back to the new mail.Switch back to new yahoo email ..?  Didnt understand your question. If you want to test the new Yahoo Mail Beta, then just wait for your turn.
Depends upon on email program.  If you are using Yahoo mail, click on the Attach Files button and fillin the name (and location) of the files to attach.  In Microsoft Outlook, look for the PaperClip to attach files.  You must know the Location (directory) and name of the file to attach.When chatting with someone, find 'Share Files' in the pull-down list. Then you can drag and drop into the messenger window. You will both have to have the latest version of Messenger.
Go to your My Yahoo! page. Click on add content and add the URL of the RSS feed. Look for an orange RSS or XML button on websites and right-click to find the URL to enter into your page.My first suggestions would be to use Google's custom main page, its what i use for my RSS - . http://www.google.com/ig?hl=en. . If you like Yahoo, use thiers at - . http://e.my.yahoo.com/config/cstore?.page=p1. . There are good instructions on both pages, just look for "Add Content" and "RSS".
they might not know that you don't want to talk to them. you might want to try e-mailing them and let them know that you don't want to talk to them. (if you haven't already tried that!)It must be because you are so darn cool. No other explaination.
Beside Folders where it says Add - Edit, click on Edit.. Then beside the folder you want to delete, click on delete.. . You won't be able to delete these default folders:. Inbox, Draft, Sent, Bulk, Trashclick on link by source and it'll tell you about it.
paul, it's true that if you merge your Yahoo and SBC Yahoo account, there'll be no way to unmerge that except to disconnect the SBCYahoo account. As long as the SBCYahoo account is active, you will have access to your yahoo account. If your SBCYahoo account is disconnected, you can unmerge your yahoo account and if dont do this it'll automatically unmerge after 90 days.According to the previous response, there is no way to do this without disconnecting your SBCYahoo. I couldn't find any evidence to the contrary, so it looks like you may have to keep the ID after all.
If you pay Yahoo $20, they will provide POP access to your email. Outlook is compatible with POP, so setting it up should not be a problem.You can if you pay for the service.  You will use it as POP account.  Yahoo! main website has information on the cost and how to set it up.sorry but you can't via outlook check your Yahoo emails, it doesn't have incoming and outgoing ports!
You can also download the latest Yahoo! toolbar from the link below.i suggest that you update your yahoo browser because your sidebar is in your ybrowser. In your homepage; go to My Account > My services > under Customized Browser click "Download it Now"...
You can not. Yahoo has that option blocked under their normal accounts. You need to get a Yahoo Plus account (you have to pay for it $19.99/year) to be able to use outlook with it.To use Yahoo! mail with outlook, you have to pay $20 a year for yahoo mail plus... I was irritated by this, and ended up paying the $20... it was totally worth it, and once you do, they guide you to set up your yahoo mail... definitely a time-saver when it comes to checking mail!
Are you using the latest version of Internet Explorer? The html editing tool used by Yahoo! Mail is not compatible with all browsers. However, you can get around this by switching to plain text mode as described in the link below.You can request a read receipt
Yahoo Messenger should have automatically created a shortcut on your desktop after it finished installing.. . Since it didn't do that, just right-click on the Yahoo Messenger program icon and select "Create Shortcut". Then, you can either drag the shortcut to your desktop or right-click again and select "Cut", to cut the shortcut that you just created. Then right-click anywhere on your desktop and select "Paste".When you installed Yahoo Messenger, doesn't it ask if you want an icon? If not, find the program on your computer, click create shortcut, and move to desktop that shortcut.First go to Iconator.com and you well receive so many icons it isn't funny.click start,programs,highlight yahoo messenger,right click on messenger (right of arrow) hit copy and then paste to desktop.
good luck. once people scam you out of your money they usually dont like to give it back.Do what I usually do: Tell them that you didn't sign up for that service and that if you don't get your money back, you'll report that to Better Business Burea and tell everyone you know not to use their service anymore. . . That usually works for me. Good Luck.
When viewing your bulk mail, instead of clicking bulk click empty and then it will ask you if you are sure you want to delete your bulk mail and you click yes. No more bulk mail.click  the box that says  check all then click delete.
I believe that Yahoo was first going to give out this free point when the service was initially created, but as far as I know nobody has yet to receive it.  In another recently asked question the Yahoo Answers Team said that this feature was not being implimented at this time but that they might consider it again in the future.I noticed the same thing among others in the lost point category.. But since were in Beta, that is the excuse.. Answers is getting debugged.. Have you noticed most things in Beta are lasting longer before coming out (MS Anti Spyware for one).
The server may be overloaded and have a short wait time before it processes the emails. (It could also be a problem with the server receiving the email.) If this is consistent, use the Help button at the top of the page to contact the Y! Mail team and notify them of the problem.They are...theoretically. Sometimes, the server through which your transmitting your e-mail may have some lag time due to maintenance, etc. More often than not though, there should be an instaneous transmission of the message. The delay could be on your end or on the receiver's. If you're noticing a consistent delay with every e-mail you send, the problem may be related specifically to your computer (i.e. connection speed, etc.)
That's it. You are already a member! Now you may ask, answer and vote.next step for what.

Philip is 100% correct. Please vote for his answer as best.The images are pixellated because of the compression used to make them fit in a smaller space. You might be able to avoid that by making the image smaller or making it the same aspect ratio (ie: 4:3) before using it.

Hold everything! G/F look whats in the works coming soon MSn and yahoo together read! Enjoy!I agree with previous answer.. Trillian, Gaim, etc etc may become things of the past in a couple of months!. . Once YM/MSN team up (though they'll still each retain their unique identities) AIM/ICQ users will be even further out in the cold, and might HAVE to move to YM or MSN just to keep in touch with the way the rest of the world is going.I dont think you can.you can download this program called trillian. it is icq or something like that, msn, yahoo, and aim all together
You can't, Yahoo! Photos is just a place to store and share your photos, It's not a software than enables you to modify themI can think of no better answer and am only replying to get this question resolved. Please vote for the other answer.
Try regular yahoo! search or another search engine with cam IM female sex Porn and you will get thousands of replies. The modifications to the search should be obvious for you to find the type you are looking for , remembering the power of exclusions -prostitutes or -naked.Visit http://profiles.yahoo.com and you will be directed to the correct page. From there, select "Advanced Search" and select the Gender (Female), Online Now. Send them a message and ask!
I've answered a similar question to this one, and I agree that there needs to be more variety in the body types for the avatars. Unfortunately, since Yahoo has made it a quasi- advertising section ( on the clothes and backgrounds etc) they are cow-towing to the media and "societal norms" of what beauty standards are. Maybe if enough of us complain, they'll get their act together just to shut us up! LOL One can hope.There actually is.  Check out the outfits section.  You will see a plus size body.  Noticed it when I was just updating my avatar outfit.and I am sure that u have better pic then this one!i was going to ask that question cause let me tall you i need thatI think that there should be, and there should be different options for height too.i don't know but that's a great question to ask!
Go to mail home see Yahoo! id there are a few links "Sign Out", "My Account" and "Switch Back". select switch back!Why would you do such a thing?  . . Anyway, on the top of the screen near the logo and underneath your Yahoo! id there are a few links.  "Sign Out", "My Account" and "Switch Back".  . . Click on "Switch Back"
They are web based and real dont have enough people to talk to everyone. Have you tried the link below! If not give it a try good luck!Please vote
I've been having the same problem, and no one at Yahoo gives a shit. I've e-mailed them many times, and keep getting back the same pat answer about "Beta not yet being supported". They're a bunch of idiots over there.Sometimes software has bugs.  I'm sure it will be fixed soon.i signed up for it a couple of weeks ago and it worked fine, maybe the list is full (which is unlikey) if you can't sign up try gmail. i send you a invite =) of couse i bet you have one already
Autofill is a function of your Browser, not the site. (The 'Remember Me' checkbox is a cookie that holds your ID and pre-fills the Username field for you).. . In Firefox, you can turn on Autofill in the Privacy section of your Settings (Tools - Options) - it's known as Saved Forms.. . In Internet Explorer, it's in Tools - Internal Options, on the Content tab it's the AutoComplete option.If you mean login, I have seen that though the login screen has the option to save the id and the password for the computer, it does not actually remember them, and I am required to enter id and password everytime i want to log in.
we generally dont have answers to 'serious questions'!!. . also... u're more likely to be picked as the best n score points fast.. in the riddles/jokes section n they're really easy n interesting.A lot of people don't know anything about the serious questions. So, they answer all the stupid stuff first. It's also possible that they don't know how to find the answers to the serious questions.coz they r easy to answer and one gets the points,so you got the point now!!!!!!!!!!Because it is a game to people and some people are just on here to get more points and it's fun. But then again aren't you perpetuating the problem by asking a question about Yahoo Answers rather than seeking some real infomtaion?Because serious questions require serious thought and very few people think these days. Do you get it.
Call Member ServicesLooks like you might have another Yahoo 360 account opened with your primary email address, or someone else  is using it for some reason. Search for your email in the Member Directory and change it there. If you cannot find it, open up a new Yahoo mail account and use that one to access your Yahoo360.
Good question!  The users have it right: Even if an account has been suspended (which stops the user from making _new_ posts), we sometimes allow _existing_ non-offensive questions to remain online.  If you ever see an offensive question left by a suspended account, please let us know.I have heard this from other suspendee's too.  Only problen is you can't respond to them, ie, call a vote, select best answer, etc.. . I believe it is as someone else said....they will got to vote.The Email feature will still be on, unless your Email is suspended as well.  What's s y?If your account was suspended, then why did you create a second account?  You are probably getting answers because they never closed your questions, and will just allow a vote to occur after 14 days...
ahoo! started out as "Jerry's Guide to the World Wide Web" but eventually received a new moniker with the help of a dictionary. "Yet Another Hierarchical Officious Oracle" is a backronym for "yahoo", but Filo and Yang insist they selected the name because they liked the word's general definition, as in Gulliver's Travels by Jonathan Swift: "rude, unsophisticated, uncouth." Yahoo itself first resided on Yang's student workstation, "Akebono," while the software was lodged on Filo's computer, "Konishiki"—both named after legendary sumo wrestlers. The "yet another" phrasing goes back at least to the Unix utility yacc, whose name is an acronym for "yet another compiler compiler".Yahoo! I know the answer to this one! I am so excited! (what a bunch of yahoos use this site!)a cry or shout of joy, i think, read a book called loser, by jerry spinelli, really stupid, but it does give you something about yahoo!in the dictionary it means: A crude or brutish person.
Also, they may legitimately get no good answers.  If you ask a question and get nothing but rude or smart-alecky answers, should you reward someone with 10 points for that?People are just abusing this service i mean it rocks and i would love to see it stay around sadley it is still in Beta stages and dont see it going furtherWell, for the most part I believe people are being lazy, or simply fail to check back on their question.. . Furthermore, some people fail to read the instructions for Yahoo! Answers before asking a question and do not know about the voting or points sytems.
Go to my Q & A link that you see towards the left of your screen. Under my info, click edit my info. There you would be able to see the option of displaying your Yahoo! avatar.Go to avatar home page!

The new policy is that it costs 2 points to ask a question.  You earn it back by participating back to the community.You asked a question, answer question, vote for answers, rate answers, and choose answers, and you can get those points back, esp when someone choose you answer as the best answer (you get 10 pts for that)Same thing happened to me. I think we ask more then we discover and do answers. I hope that's the reason.its easy to understand you ask a quetion you lose 2 points you answer a question you earn 2 ...........................simpleu losr pionts because u arent answering peoples questions or asking themwhen you ask a ? you lose 2 pointsyea what that person said it now costs 2 points to ask a questionI believe you need to seek counsel to sue Yahoo to get your 2 points back.. . Hope that is helpful.It's a give and take thing.  Answer some questions and you get points back.  Pretty simple really.  Like paying to use the service and getting paid to participate.  A system of checks and balances or rewards and fees.I No that Sux now i cAnn't aSk QeStiOns wIthOut LoSin" PoNiTS!1!!1!!11111!!1!!!!

Internet is world wide.  Go to an internet caf?.If she has access to a computer with an internet connection then she'll be able to respond to your emails. There are also cybercafes where computers with internet connections can be publically used. Maybe she's having fun right now and didn't get around to writing. I'm sure she will soon.If she is staying at a hotel, they can help her with her email.  If she has a wireless notebook, then she can visit a place like Starbucks.

Because they don't want people spamming Yahoo Answers with dumb questions. :-)It's a new rule for yahoo answer users. but you will get them back once you choose the best answer.im not entirely sure, but i think its fair, you are seeking information, so its only fair you lose something for that, the more information you dispense to others the more points you get, it seems reasonable to meIt takes 2 points which you get back when you vote for a best answer.... . So, did it really take a thing?id go with mattloc and isabel

I think they should have a column for questions that are coming up in the next day, so that people can get a few last answers in before it expires. I also wondered the same thing and this is a solution I have come up with. To some people really wanting points, this might even work best because maybe they have something that noone else who has replied has even thought of yet, and by looking at others answers, it gives you a better idea of what to say.You just click on the menu at the left of the screen to find an area that you know something about...then answer those questions.. . Or, you can use the search to find them.. . If you are looking for yours...click on My Q&A and there they are.i just can
you would think they would encourage the questions.... . . oh thanks ElizaThey are substracting two points when you ask a question, but if you pick a best answer or put it to a vote, you'll get your points back. This is to make sure that people don't ask questions just to get points.I think it's to discourage stupid, pointless questions.i dont know either..From POINTERS: . . "Asking questions is a point-neutral process: each question "costs" two points to ask, but you get those points right back when you choose the best answer (or put the answers up for a vote).  We imposed the "cost" when we noticed that some people were spewing out meaningless "questions" just for the sake of earning points, without any intention of picking the best answer."I think it's to keep people from asking so many questions without answering any. But if you don't ask how will you get an answer?

i think it's so that people don't keep asking questions and no one answers any. so now you have to answer some if you want to ask lots of questions.Yahoo! is trying to prevent stupid questions from being asked. Although most people on here use it correctly, I've seen a decrease in abusive and stupid questions.no, they want u to answer other pples questions. i know, i dont get that, but u get it bck when u choose an answer.people have been asking stupid questions, so the yahoo members decided to take away 2 points for a question. this makes us ask questons wisely. you can get your ponits back by coming here the next day and choosing your best answerIt's a new feature.  You'll get the points back when you call a vote or when you choose the best answer.  Also, it was supposed to stop people from asking the same question over and over, and it's obviously not working, as we see here.people still ask stupid questions.dont kno its just so stupidCheck this out, it might answer your question

Yahoo 360 is all in one including your breif profile, ur intrests ur blog ur friends , pictures that u share with others. its a whole different new lovely thingits a blog thingWhy not search Yahoo! and find out?because this is searching yahoo!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
For now get MSN. Or one of the all-in-one's like Trillium.. . Eventually I think Yahoo will have a way of doing it, but not yet.Double click their screen name.u download msn or trillian.
when you use yahoo's instant messenger, you can show only your head, part of your body , or your whole body with a background and everything. It lets you zoom in/out to show as much as you want. But answers only shows the head shot cause the windows are too small.because in other areas of yahoo! avatars have the full body showing- yahoo! thinks naked people is inappropriate conduct for this 13+ siteDid you see the life guard one?Are u saying u don't want clothes? Cuz that is NASTYAvatars have clothes because maybe Yahoo is going to do something later on where our avatar's entire bodies are showing but for now, all they can do is have it so that our avatars heads are shown.That is a good question. I guess there is a way to enlarge your Avatar picture and that nobody wants to see it naked.cuz nobody wants to see a naked avatar!!!!

you can ask. that's the only way for you to find out. you cant access it just like that, coz if the member has a personal account, for security reason, the password is kept in confidential and privacy.you ask that person or you would be commiting identity theft.keyword logger is the technical answer, but you'll probably find out stuff that you don't want toShe put it in the "Yahoo! Messenger" section for a reason.you need to be more specific than that. what password? email? computer? is it someone who you know at work, at home, at school?
It may have been a temporary server problem, but I've never experienced anything of the sort on Yahoo! Messenger.Please be more specific. . I dont understand waht you mean.. . Barbie

Voila.i think you need a programme call anti-spy you can download it free from yahoo tollbar: http://toolbar.yahoo.com/ or the best anti-spy programme for me its http://www.softvers.com/i have Yahoo Toolbar is best Search the web is yahoo! becase in google many intenet in yahoo!

they're probably corrupted or there's something wrong with the registry entries for those programs. uninstall and reinstall both; that should fix it.Your comp's internal clock could be off to fix that press F2 during startup or what ever you press to access the setup menu, from that you can change the internal clock setting!. For messenger and itunes uninstall the programs (thru the contro panel)and then download thm again from the inernet. Good Luck!
I have used several dialup ISPs, DSL, and cable for the past 10 years and have very rarely had a problem with Yahoo being down. In fact, I can only remember 1 time. It may depend on your ISP or where in the world you are. I am on the US east coast and the Yahoo service has been rock solid for me.Er.... I suggest you check with your doctor !
If it is a firewall or browser problem, try switching to text mode rather than html formatting. Instructions are explained in the link below.If you have an antivirus program- turn down the settings or allow more use for your email. That usually causes that. If its not your antivirus program, your virtual memory on your computer could be low. Then you would have to delete some programs to make extra room for storage.
What are you trying to ask?  Are you saying you don't want those services to load?Please be more specific with your question.  What issue are you facing?  Do you face any error messages?  Is the issue with Symantec or Yahoo Mail?  Are you trying to access you email using a browser (Internet Explorer) or using an email client like Outlook Express?
Sorry, there is no way to create a new status message, but I think you only have 5 or 6 custom messages. After that, the old ones will be overwritten.Delete
I have asked a few, no, I am not referring to my sarcastic ones, they have yet to be answered adequately. I ask when I have something to ask. I think it usually works that way.I do agree with you.  The flavor of the questions has changed, and they do not seem to be as good as they were just a couple of weeks ago.Oh, you mean questions where people don't use correct english and misspell words, like this one?Why did you ask yoursUSE SPELL CHECK! IT IS CALLED A DICTIONARY!!!!!!!Maybe we've all been on here so long we're running out of the "good" questions.  ;)common sense is quite uncommon these datesThere is no motivation to write good questions.I think for the same reason people do not spell check here (hint)
The size of the text? If its the size of the text go to "View" and then "Text size".

The answer is NO, photomail is something different from the new Yahoo Mail Beta. So you have something to looking forward to :)All people who have yahoo ID can download and use photo mail without waiting, no invitations needed. The invitation from your friend was a sort of information for you, you can access photo mail without it. The yahoo mail beta you are waiting for is something new, be patient, you are on the list.
Depends on your level.  Check out the levels and you'll see.. . You're a level 1.  You can answer 5 questions.When you have under 250 points you may only ask 5 questions a day.depends what your level is...you can find out more by clicking the link next to your screename called Level:#
You should aim to reach a higher level. That way, for example, you shouldn't suffer from the same limitations that new members face.Maybe.  You can only do it a few times per day, depending on your level.
Yahoo also now incorporate "Flickr", which is worth a look. Otherwise, Yahoo Photos does a fine job.try yahoo photos, it's unlimited and free
I still haven't figured it out... I've never been able to do this.Use two different client programs. The rare times I have two IDs going on Yahoo, I use Yahoo IM and Fire.
go to "control panel" then "add/remove programs".  scroll down until u see yahoo toolbar.  click on it to removeYou can select Uninstall from the pencil menu in Yahoo! Toolbar. (or go to Add/Remove Programs)
Under Windows XP, you can run a version of Yahoo messenger for each Windows user.  Just log in to different Windows accounts and start messenger.  Probably not what you're looking for, but can be useful in some cases.On the same machine (unless you are using VirtualPC or VMWare) you can't.
Yahoo added themes to 360! wow fun huh!. go here or from your 360 my page select change theme.If you mean adding smiles to your post, click the little smile in the tool bar while you're typing your post
Just invite the real people from the chat room to an Messenger conference. Then you can chat all you want without interference from bots.Because the "bots" are registered as users, and keep changing their names.  It would be an impossible task to block every one, becasue they just appear with new nicks a few minutes later...    and, frankly, there's no profit to Yahoo in doing so.. In addition, they seem to be de-emphasising the chat rooms, they already got rid of user-created rooms, thus forcing people to congregate in a small number of rooms with known, fixed names...  making them better targets for the bots.. So I suspect that somebody at yahoo has decided not to bother.  It is free, after all...  and you get exactly what you pay for.   Now, if all the *advertisers* started leaving.... they'd pay attention
You are probably having problems with your internet connection. When your messenger cannot pick up the connection from the Yahoo! server, it will sign out automatically.Wrong password perhaps. Make sure you type in the correct password including the correct capital letters. Forgot password?

by showing the advertisements on the mail ids and in web serarches they r getting money for every advertisements . the advertising cost is very high in such popular sites like google and yahoo/Every time someone clicks on the ad's they show, they get paid a few cents.  Since this is happening thousand of times per minute... yahoo is very profitable.
maybe they cantain spam.It could be identified as spam mail. There are many factors involved, and also depends on the spam filters and provider.. . In Yahoo, you can log in your Yahoo account, go to option, select Filter, and put in the details of your incoming mail and ask Yahoo to automatically send it to your Inbox.. . This way, your mail will go to Inbox, instead of been identified as spam.
Look at my picture and try to make an avatar look like that.  I tried, but couldn't come close.  That's why I put a photo of myself in.Well, it is possible to make your own Avatar, but I believe you have to sign up for yahoo 360.  Thats what I did to get a custom Avatar based on a drawing instead of a regular yahoo Avatar.It is impossible for Yahoo to provide all kinds of avatars. To solve the problem of people demanding a perfect avatar to represent themselves, Yahoo has given the option to upload their own pictures.You can upload a picture for your avatar.  Maybe Yahoo didn't consider all the shapes/sizes/colours of all the users ;)
You "pay" 2 points to ask, but get them back when you pick a Best Answer.. . This was done to try to cut down on spamming, attempts at trying to establish Free personals ads, and to cut down on the number of lame questions that have been on here.They now take two points for each question asked to slow down the flow of questions.  It started with giving points, but the quality of questions went down.  You can read it in the blog on the top right corner of this page.Everytime you ask a question it will cost you points.  Everytime you answer a question it will give you points.  Click on My Q&A, then your screen name, total points, or level at the top of that screen.  It will explain everything.it is the way yahoo answers works, you will lose pont if you ask ;)every time you aswer a question you gain two points but everytime you ask one youlose two points??. . it'sjust policy?was it good or what???
You may have a corrupt file in your Yahoo! Messenger directory. To fix the problem, you must manually delete the "Messenger" directory on your C: drive (default), then reinstall the Yahoo! Messenger Application.I think you need to reinstall the messenger , this happens when you uninstall any software from your system .
Follow the instructions?. . In most sites, they'll send an Email to the address meant to be validated, and provide a link that will validate the Email."Rosie" said what i was going to say!!  Now maybe this question can be retired!!
because people report abuse. the people from yahoo also think that that is an inapropriate question. does that answer your question?It's cause of questions like yours

advertisers cut funding when dateline and others said Yahoo! chat rooms where the #1 choice for pedofiles.because rather than police them like other chat servers Yahoo decided to kill them all and call it good.  Eventhough in all the yahoo created rooms you can find the same kinds of things that killed the user rooms.

They're repetative questions that have been asked a lot.

Go to yahoo 360 click on settings, now scroll down to display me as! Choose top of three choices save at the bottom! Wait for 5 minutes and it will show old ID!Go to 360.yahoo.com and delete your Yahoo! 360 profile and it'll still have your ID because you use it for yahoo messenger.
bcuz it depends on what mail server the sender uses, and on his/her mailbox defaults. for example, in "walla" they need to change the language default to "hebrew ISO-sumthing". so i think u can do nothing but to ask them to write in hebrew mode. or u can try changing your web browser language encoding, but i don't think that will do.. last line, they better write in english :)You have to make sure that those who receive your emails have the same Hebrew fonts that you do, or that whatever you send can be read by the Hebrew fonts that they do have. Not all word processors, Word, Wordperfect, etc, come with compatible fonts, certainly not compatible Hebrew fonts.
Simply find the Yahoo IDs of your close friends and add them to your Yahoo list (they will need to confirm and will add you too).  You can also go to chat rooms and find some interesting people there.  You can also add my ID to your list ;)Join a chatroom.You could download a program called IM2 at http://www.im2.com/ for free and as they are typed into your contact list for Yahoo, they will appear as they are logged on. You can also search your contacts for somebody.Right here.
Well if you mean an autoreply such as when you're on vacation or something then on the top right hand side of the Yahoo mail page you will find 'Options' click on that you will find "Vacation Response' and by clicking on that you can choose the message you want sent and the dates this option will be turned on. In doing this, anyone sending you an email to your account during the specified time will get the message you saved.The previous response is correct. Please select it as best answer.. . (However, if you were talking about another form of automatic messages, Yahoo! does not provide that capability.)
Did you read this page on how to? Please do its pretty easy!i will suppose you are using Yahoo Mail to send pics so this is how you do it.

After this click the "attach files" button at the bottom. If you are using a different program let me know and i will be able to help you. Good Luck.

Some people are not ethical, do not care, are immature, do not realize the implications.  Any way you want to put it - what they are doing is wrong when it comes to answering serious medical, legal, etc. questions.98% of the answers on here however are subjective and therefore based on opinions, assumptions, and ideas. You seem to be getting this service confused with Google's similar service.Bearing what you said in mind, I would not use this site as a source of information regarding truly serious topics.. . To answer your question, I think that earning points is probably about 95% of the reason people do that.  I do believe that sometimes people are just trying to be mean.  There are a lot of good people online, but there are also a lot heartless a$$holes.My "guess" is they want mindless points. I would never answer a medical or legal question if i had not experienced firsthand or investigated the issue first. I have a colon disorder, so if i am asking a question concerning this medical condition, i am expecting a true, factual answer. Not some "wild guess" or thoughtless answer just for 2 points.Serious medical or legal questions should be posed to a doctor or a lawyer...not to random people on some website.

Click 'file' at the upper left or your screen, choose 'save as' instead of 'save'. Hope this helps.If you are using a program like MicroSoft Word (or pretty much any Windows program these days) go to the File menu and choose Save As instead of just Save. Then you can decide where the file is put on your computer.. . You can also locate a particular file going through My Computer or Windows Explorer and Cut or Copy and Paste it to the file you want it in.u make a copy of it, go to one copy, save as, type a different name, go below and save it as a different filem, den click save- assuming u hav microsoft word
It could be that your emails are being filed into the "Junk Mail" folder automatically. To correct this, you should have your friends with Yahoo Mail enter you into their address book.Well, your mail account could be to old, sometimes that hgappens if you have had you yahoo account for a long time. Or your emails can be getting to the Bulk Folder. Or if you can't figure it out, contact Yahoo Support
It's probably either the firewall or extra programs you have running in the background that are interfering with Yahoo! Messenger. Be sure to close all extra programs and follow the steps in the link below to make sure your Messenger is configured properly.check your internet connection, if that works and you cant still connect to yahoo then check your firewall. most of the time its not a yahoo problem but the internet providers. other times its just windows. if its windows thendo the ultimate correction factor - reboot.. . hope this helps.

Yahoo! Mail beta uses a lot of script which has to be loaded from the start rather than just the necessary parts with each page you go to. With up-to-date computers and high-speed internet connections, this is not a problem for many users, but if you have an older computer with dial-up the traditional mail is a much better choice.I tried it too, and switch back. It is way too slow. It's almost as bad as the Outlook Web Access we have for work.
This maybe because you have blocked the HTML graphics from being downloaded in the email. You can uncheck the option in Yahoo! Mail > options > General Preferences.Correct.

According to the Yahoo Answers Team's blog, basically so that people don't just post useless questions just so they can pick a best answer and gain the points. This way you get the points back assuming you pick a best answer or put it to a vote but you don't get extra points for it. Makes sense to me and it seems it has somewhat cut down on frivolous questions. Or not :pI guess they wanted to penalize people for asking unnecessary questions.  There were many more inane questions early on, when they actually added points just for asking a question.  That wasn't working.this is Yahoo quality control...or it may make people think twice or more before they wanted to waste 2 point asking something that may not really important for them :)It does "cost" 2 points to ask a question. This is to try to limit the number of frivolous questions that are posted. It is a way to try to put more quality control in the site. Two points is a bargin!All are answered...I don't know I think its just a way for yahoo to keep us coming back! (haha)so that we dont just ask questions and not answer people.This leads me back to the question why is it there are more questions asked than answered? If they gave us points for asking we never get any answere i guess.

More people use PC.  That is probably the reason.Macs Are to slowThe answer about macs are too slow isnt correct. the newest macs are faster than PCs by far. . This seems most likely a case of bad business by an almost monopoly. If a certain company, let say "micro-hard" just so we dont take chances messing with potential danger, realizes that its largest competitor (apple) has better hardware and software than the computers that carry it software, one easy way to stay in business would be to pay many companies to make all software for the competing company inferior, as to make the customer believe that the computers by the competing company are inferior.. . I almost forgot to mention, if you think the mac version is bad, take a look at the unix version. poor thing is a crying shame. I guess Gates really does rule the world.

Their IM button will appear as online if they are invisible to you only.You can see in the address book in your mail area.If they logged in invisible in the beginning then they can come visible and go back invisible in your address book but,if they come on visible and then try to go invisible it will still show them on in your mail area in the address book.that is a feature in yahoo mseenger for ones security so u cant see others

It is a VERY dumb idea for Yahoo to limit the number of questions that one can answer. It's bad enough that their insipid point system borders on being Pavlovian, but to further restrict people from asking or answering however many questions they would like is pointless. (no pun intended)well put the above post is well wrotewell i donno but i think it is stupid and thanks for andsering mi question  thats how i feel to

Britain refused to change their currency from pounds to euros because the mathematically-challenged common people of britain would have trouble adjusting to the new system of 100 cents in a euro as opposed to their look-mummy-i'm-SO-unique 11 pence crap. Basically the brits started out thinking they were oh-so-smart being different (currency and driving on the left side of the road being just 2 examples) and ended up not accepting the obvious fact that the world is laughing at themIt's called a Euro (not Euro pound) and it's the currency that is used for all of Europe except for Britain. They refused to convert to the Euro to give up a very stable form of currency for an unsure one. The British pound has been around for 100s of years and definitely retains its value. It is probably the most stable form of currency available because of its strong history. For example, today's rate of exchange between the US dollar and the pound was $1 US = .56 pounds. It usually hovers a little over 50 cents for each US dollar.The difference is that the British pound exists, while the Euro pond doesn't.

You may want to check firewall settings, or attempt to connect with your firewall disabled and see if that allows you to login.
Kirun's answer I agree with.  However, I don't believe that USERS should not have the say, only because there are some people who find simple things to be abuseive...such as..If I were to ask a question about homosexualty, drugs or certian politics..some people would say "Oh no, that is ofensive (not even having experince), that is TABOO"..I would like to ask some questions, so I can get HONEST ANSWERS from people who have lived it.  I wish that there was an OPEN or an ADULT fourm like this so I could ask some questions from strangers and get some other opinions from strangers without being too censored.That system seems to be working out pretty good.  There are enough users who are concerned about the quality of content that it hopefully gives the Yahoo! folks time to work on other stuff.They do blank out some words tho.I say because peaple would get mad at them deleting there question and woudn't use it anymore.Yahoo answers is in Beta form. That's what beta is all about.There are questions that would get censored wrongly if this was implemented... Note for example the questions on a certain D. Clark getting starred out.. . What's needed is an option for people to choose whether they want the raw realities of life, or a "safe" edition for those who get offended by stuff. A lot of harm is done by not talking about certain topics and I think it's best if people have a space to ask things that maybe they are to embarrassed to bring up in a face-to-face conversation.. . One thing I'd like is a "this is a work machine" option, so I can keep reading all the questions at home, but keep it clean at work where the site could prove a useful resource (if somebody actually answered my question. Oh well.)because it would take time/money and its easier not to do it give them some feedback about it if you havent already
If you are using an e-mail program like oUtlook express or outlook.. make sure you have SMTP authentication turned on ... if ur using a NON SBC Yahoo! Internet connection- change SMTP port to 587. . Turn off your anti-virus if the above does not work..Check with your ISP. Many of them don't allow you to send mail through the servers of anybody but them, in order to prevent relay spam.i dont know. something's wrong with your account then.
As far as I know you can not delete your account. You just leave it alone and it will be disable in 3 months after you stop using it. Then, the e-mails will not be delivered to the Yahooa ccount. Just get another account, they are free and there are many!dont use it for 3 months and they will delete it for you.

To give more people time to answer. Also if you know what the answer is, why do you ask the question?I am a little concerned about this myself. Fewer people seem to be coming back and checking their old questions after 24 hours.....2 days.......even 4 days since this began. I'm curious to see how this works as well.Maybe if they realize many people don't like it, they will change it back.Because there is no established criteria for determining the ability to evaluate (or know) whether or not an answer is actually correct.

It means that people are still testing it to make sure it works properly. All software must go trough beta testing, the longer the beta lasts, the better the software will be.Beta means it isn't product quality software yet. A company will put out an early release to get feedback from users before they make it generally available and support it."Beta" means that it's an experimental version, one used for testing, working out bugs, etc.It means they are still "testing" it... it's not the final product.

yahoo means a lout, a loud obnoxious boy.... the guys who came up with the name saw that definition in the dictionary and thought yup good definition so it stuck. they liked the way it sounded when you said it tooThe two students from stanford where just trying to be silly when they came up with the name way back in 1996.

Newer questions get more activity on Yahoo! Answers than old ones.. 2) If you do re-post your question, consider why it wasn't answered the first time. Could it be more specific?

You can get their attention with this. It just sends them a buzz...it's a way of getting their attention. kinda like ringing a doorbell. if the person has their sound on and they walk away from the computer or are on another website, it's a way to tell them that you really want to talk to them.... . unfortunately it can be used to be very annoying too....depending on the person using it, lol.It's like telling them to hurry up! or a good way to get someones attention.Thats when you go to the actions button at the top of the messenger widow and click buzz. it makes the other persons computer ring.

but he can always create new ids or change names. Though i understand that we cant please everybody but he seem to generalize everybody in the yahoo staff...Limiting a persons freedom of speech is wrong, even on the internet.  However, if you find something that he has written in bad taste, simply report his answer/question/comment.. . That's the best way.  Another way is to simply not read his comments/questions/answers.Well, if the questions and comments are really offensive,it will be reported as abuse, and eventually he'll get banned. And then probably come back as another screenname.

This could be a combination of issues, it could be your modem, it could be your isp, it could be the type of network you are running.  Sometimes the modem may be "connected", but there may not be enough bandwidth running through to keep yahoo messenger open.

We started the policy of having each question "cost" two points when we noticed that some people were trying to rack up points with meaningless "questions" that they had no intention of monitoring.  "Cost" is in quotes because, as soon as you choose a best answer or put the answers up for a vote, you get those two points back.there are new rules written in yahoo blog. part of them states that you lose 2 points just for asking a question.they just started this soon after i arrived. :(A new policy of Yahoo Answer
When you select the "Download" link, it will ask you whether or not you want the newer version or not.  Personally, I'd go with the new because I had the old, now I have the new and there really isn't any difference besides one can be used with voice and one without.  The one with voice is a slightly bigger download if you're concerned with space on your hardrive.Just type yahoo messenger in seach toolbar .... then.. so many yahoo messenger Old & New is available.I don't think you can get it here but you may be able to find it on the web but make sure you don't get a fake virus scam.

it wont matter who provides your internet connection, ISP, as long as you have a connection you should be able to send mails. try sending those mails on a different browser.Go to the compose button and then write your email, then press send.

I guess cause if there wasn't someone could sit here all day and answer all the questions with one random word, get tonnes of points, and really not contributed to Yahoo! Answers at all.It gives you an incentive to come back.It's also so that newbies on the site won't be able to answer as many questions as people who have been here longer. Supposedly the more points you have (and the more questions you can answer) means your answers are more reliable.Yes, there is. You can see the limitations on the chart here: http://answers.yahoo.com/info/scoring_systemso that people doesn't give stupid answers for the sake of earning the points.
to keep track of questions- if you find one interesting you might want to read other answers. also, to keep track of users that ask a lot of questions you like. keeps you in touch w/ your "friends"I use for questions that I may not know the answer to and would find it interesting or useful for myself. Or sometimes I just can't think how I want to answer that question so I set it aside there for a bit. A least then you can delete it when you are done. Sure wish there was a way to delete the My Answer section.If you've answered something that you would enjoy seeing other people's answers to as well, the Watch List allows you and quick and easy way to keep an eye on those questions, so you can check them out periodically before the question closes. Basically, just a way to keep tabs on an interesting question.
First get a free Yahoo email account. Notify everyone of your new e-address change. When your sure everyone knows (give it at least a month) to use the new yahoo email address you can cancel AOL.Open a Yahoo email place for yourself.  Then email all AOL stuff you want to keep to your new place.. . Then tell AOL to delete everything over there.  They may also have a forwarding service that automatically routes to your new place, but that would mean all the spam and junk would follow you.  So better to just delete it and send your new email address to everyone important.aol is your isp. you can make yahoo your homepage in internet option from the tools tab. type in yahoo.com in address bar...or you can change your isp...maybe a local server...i really like that better and you get personal help over the phone...no charge.
hahah!  actually, my avatar is more aged.  You do have the option of having them look a little older, have gray hair, no hair, along with different body types.  If you play around with it you will see the different types.I agree they all do pretty much have a youthful appearance... They will probably add more to choices available if they get enough complaints about it.
Two ways. 1. they get you to but music unlimited and score. 2. they sell advertising space associated with music customersAdvertisements. Companies will pay yahoo each time their advertisement is clicked on, or comes up, or any of that. It's the same way TV stations profit from getting high ratings. The more a company's commercial is viewed, the more that station gets.
the font in what? Internet Explorer? Microsof Word? Excel? Powerpoint?When editing an e-mail in Yahoo! Mail, click on the button in the toolbar that has two F's on it (when you hover, it will say Font Face).  Choose Times New Roman from the list.  I don't think there is any way to make it your default font.If in any Microsoft software, highlight text that you want to change, and press Ctrl + D. This will show a prompt telling you all these options. Now, just highlight "Times New Roman" in the font menu.. (Note: If you have it (Formatting Toolbar), it should have this section where you can change your default text when you type; Word only) . . I'm not sure about IE but I'm pretty sure you can't.
If I understand you do not want your email address to show! make sure you check the appropriate box below! for it not to be displayed! good luck!you cant remove it u only can create a new one and after ? days it will be deleted.
You have to sign-in bec you're accessing mails that are maybe confidential, important, etc... Dont access mails and you wont be asked to sign-in. However you may set your browser to remember your ID and password and you dont sign-out!So everyone in the world doesn't have access to it.How do you know that this is your email if you didn't sign into it ! unless you signed in the email and let the browser remember your user name and password
i'm not sure, you weren't specific enough on any error messages.. try uninstalling and reinstallingit just doesnt like you... uninstall it from your computer and delete all of the yahoo folders you can find and install it againtry going in to add or remove programs and deleteing it. then to yahoo and redownloading it again.... thats all i can say
You mean, like this one?. Just kidding.. . The reality is that real questions are harder to answer. There are many real questions that I would like to answer, but simply don't know.Because they are easy to answer and everyone can answer them but some questions need professional answers specially law and credit questions which you cant answer easily.i'm sorry. what was the question?because people want to show their sense of humour with those answersIt's easy - everyone ask for some more 'Yahoo Answers' points... even me! :)cuz there are lots of dumbs to answer those questions.people just love answering stupid things instead of what's really important, trust me even I do thatyou right about that I wrote about a serious question and it never got answered but that's ok.Everyone can respond to the dumbest questions. Many of the people on Yahoo! Answers just view this as a sort of game to try and get the most points. . . Not everyone knows the answers to serious questions, and it kind of detracts from the games. I do try to answer a few serious questions everyday, but to get points I often just look around for easy things I can answer.Probably because your question is harder to answer.
Send an e-mail in response to the e-mail telling them why they were suspended.  If it was because of 6 violations that really weren't violations they'll unsuspend them.  Lots of people are confused and easily offended by things they see and jump right on that "report abuse" link.  6 of those is a suspension.read the Community Guidelines stuff and discover whyI'm not sure - one of my friends also was suspended and yahoo doesn't let them know what is going on...
You need to upgrade Yahoo! Mail Plus.  It costs $19.99 per year and then they will give you instructions on how to configure Outlook Express to use the POP3 server to download your email.It appears that the question period has expired. If you have received an answer that meets your needs, _please_ choose one of those as a 'best answer' as soon as you can; otherwise, this question will go to an automatic vote. If you haven't received a good answer for your question, you may want to consider the following,. . 1) Remove this version of your question and re-post your question. Newer questions get more activity on Yahoo! Answers than old ones.. 2) If you do re-post your question, consider why it wasn't answered the first time. Could it be more specific? Could it be worded better? Were there grammatical or spelling errors? Was it in the best category? Can you provide more helpful details?. . If it doesn't seem likely that re-posting your question will help you, then here's a listing of my favorite 'answer sites'. Maybe one of them will help you.. . Answers.com http://www.answers.com/. Bartleby http://www.bartleby.com/. Yahoo Reference http://education.yahoo.com/reference/.... HowStuffWorks http://www.howstuffworks.com/. Wikipedia http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/main_page.... . Since I really haven't answered your question, it is not necessary to give me any points. Regards.
LOL... either your screen resolution is too low or you have done a CTRL-wheel down.  Right click your desktop->properties->settings tab->try adjusting your screen resolution.  Or just open a web page and do a CTRL-wheel up.Eric, I think that question belongs in "Computers" somewhere, surely it's not specifically related to Yahoo 360 ?. . Anyway, I mainly wanted to say to JT, Hey, neat trick !  Thank you.  :-)
New system that Yahoo! Answers has implemented supposedly as a way to eliminate silly questions!! :-(http://blog.360.yahoo.com/y_answrs_team its the "in" thingThe rules of Yahoo Answers (Beta) have been changed. Silly questions or repeats of frequently asked questions are meant to be discouraged, and participation to regain those points is meant to be encouraged.. . You will get those two points back if you rate a best answer or put the question to a vote if you receive several answers. If nobody answers, the two points are gone for good.You will be charged 2 points EVERY time you ask a question now. It is not related to your level at all.. . You will be reimbursed the 2 points when you select a best answer or put the answers to a vote.. . Your points will remain the same, so YES you DO now lose points for asking a question, seeing as yesterday you GAINED 2 points for selecting a best answer or putting it to a vote.It's a new thing so that people won't ask "why is the sky blue" and "what is the meaning of life" over and over again - to try and get people to think before they ask, and to get them to chose an answer before the question expires.you get -2 when ask a question then you get it back when you choose a best answer. They do that so you will choose a best answer and not just delete it.Because there is a new Feature.. Go here to read more.... . http://blog.360.yahoo.com/blog-d8pH0dcoRKeB12yOcnUQp.9VCFos?p=369
True, there is clutter here (also called noise). It's perhaps not something Yahoo were expecting, but they deserve to be given a chance to rectify the situation. Well, I am hoping they rectify it. Soon!Why do we need more useless info? Because we get points for it.Well, it is easier to get information if you can post a question and someone answers it. Much easier than searching through blogs and bulletin boards. As you probably noticed, though, lots of the questions posted could be answered easily by doing a Yahoo! or Google search.. . That said, the quality of answers is pretty uneven here, so you do take a chance when you post a question that you might not get a good answer.. . Of course, the biggest reason to do this is marketing. It is entertaining for people to do this, and it brings lots of traffic to Yahoo! The people here might use other Yahoo! services and might visit the advertisers that Yahoo! has on its sites. This is how Yahoo! makes money.It's a matter of marketing...  If one of the major companies out there doesn't create a service, most people don't know about it...  . . Some people out there, never navigate away from services they trust, ie. Yahoo.  If services aren't provided like 360 and Answers, most people will not be aware there are things out there to do...I don't think it's exactly clutter, although some of the questions & answers are. I do have to say in favour of it, there is a lot worse out there on the internet.google answers makes you pay, and this is one super forum instead of going through the annoyance of signing up to thousands of small specialized forums.
You can't do it yourself. The system will delete them after 120 days.after 14 days sent invitations become expired invitations and you can delete them from your inbox.
Always remember right click . right click on it it will give you options and go from there. most people dont realize how much the right click will do for youtheres option for removing history
Thats a wonderful question,because I love to see my women on the heavy side...mmm...mmm....good!!!!!They assume that every woman (and man, I suppose) wants to be thin, therefore they would want their avatar thin.  Who in their right mind would CHOOSE to be heavy, right?  Wrong.  I'm with you in wishing that their avatars offered a bit more choice as to body size.  Having only idealized thin people perpetuates stereotypes about bodies and body images.how thick are you? please tell me.hahahaha! that's true huh? well i think it's because they work for the diet pill companies (it's a conspiracy)
tell that person to stop im'ing you! the simplest way is to tell the person that you cousin or somthin is going to be taking you email adress until you get a new email adress. good luck! ;)Go to your preferences, then ignore list...add people there.  Don't forget to Apply and click ok.  Also, remove them from your address book.
Good luck with that, I have been trying to get a hold of them for a week becuz my account got suspended and it said if this is any error email us at customer support.  Have not heard back yet.just download yahoo messenger and. chat unlimited with anyone you want to chat or. in your case be in touch.
You're talking about two different things.  Yahoo Answers is in Beta testing, which means that they're working the bugs out of it.. . Javascript is a scripting language used to add functionality to web pages.Werecow knows his stuff as usual. Please select for his response as best answer.
Go to your my yahoo page it should say on top change colors. A little link beneath the search bar!. Check out belowAre you referring to Yahoo!360 page?. If so, then you can proceed as follows :-. . Go to 'My Page'. . Select 'Change theme' option you see on the top of your page. Select the theme with your desired colour.. . Click 'Save'. . You are done.. Mission accomplished!. -----------------------------------------. . Oops! I just realized that you were asking about your "MY YAHOO!" Page.. Here is the procedure -. 1. Go to "My Yahoo!". 2. Click "Change colors" on the top of your page. 3. Now, on the left margin, you see a list as under-. # Colours (20). # cute stuff (8). # Seasons (6). # Yahoo! (4). # Lights n shades (8). # Sky & space (4). # Patterns (13). # Sports (1). # Industrial (8). # Animals (20). # Flowers (3). # Featured. . Click # colors to change the color.. Or click any one option from the list to change the theme.. Now, when the list appears before you, click the button which says "USE THIS THEME" to apply that color.. Now, you are done!
I think you mean ytunnel basic? It's been discontinued, only the pro version is availableThe above post is correct. Please vote for it as best answer.
you can't.  two is possible with some program, but I can't remember the name of it.  The only way to sign in with multiple accounts is to do it on multiple computers.Don't vote for my answer. The above answer looks reasonable. . No further answer is needed, but a second answer is the only way to close the question.
If you're still looking for a screen name, you can go to the link below to create new profiles. When you send a message to someone, it will then ask you which profile you want to use while talking to that person.DUDE WHAT KIND OF SCREENNAME IS "SCREENNAME". . IF I WAS YOU I WOULD TRY TO CHANGE MY SCREENNAME
I assume you mean "Spam" here.. . The reason they don't bother is that they're out to make money, and they don't care who they annoy. Most cancel links in spam are bogus, anyway. For all they know, you might one day respond to a message, and they're just playing the numbers game on this - the cost of sending to one extra user is practically zero.If you don't know the sender, it is recommended that you don't click on any link in the email, as it will just let the sender know that your account is active and that you read the email. Please just use the "Mark as Spam" button to delete it and to help Yahoo! filter these messages out of their system.
Just use yahoo! messenger, it has a feature that notifies you when you get mail and it even lists the incoming mail (subject line, sender and time received)Yahoo! Toolbar notifies you when you have new mail, and has other handy features as well, like a built-in search box, anti-spy capabilities, etc.Depends on where your email sever is. . . To download the emails and get the notifier, I use incredimail.install yahoo messenger or if you have gmail, gmail notifier
It is a way to get people to think before asking questions like "why is the sky blue" and "what is the meaning of life". It is supposed to help cut down on the amount of stupid questions, and to get people to think before posting a question that will get deleted. But you will get the 2 points back when you select an answer or put it up for a vote.Yeah, this is the law now! New school rules!WOW thanks for letting me know...if you read the blog, they updated...thats one of the updates...i know it sucks!
It appears that the question period has expired. If you have received an answer that meets your needs, please choose a 'best answer.'. Regards.if the email on the yahoo.. so u can use the yahoo search which u can find it in the messenger... and if it's on another website so u can check the website first and look for the search part
Go to the little pencil sign on the left of the toolbar.   Then, go to Personal Options and then Add/Edit Buttons.  There, you can choose buttons.  After you are finished, you can either click Finished or Change the Layout, which means you can change the order of the buttons.Sign in to your toolbar and click on the little pencil icon next to the search box.  Under Personal options is an option to add/edit buttons.i know how but i don't tell you. hahahahahahaha   that's cool
It's probably corrupt. Try uninstalling it, reboot, download and reinstall again...Maybe you have a vires in your computer.
Go to http://mobile.yahoo.com/mobilemail to check what versions of Yahoo! mobile mail are available for your cell phone/carrier combination.I can not vouch for the other answer but can't think of a better one and am only replying to get this question resolved. Please vote for the other answer.
Go your account page and Edit/create profiles. Have fun!consider creating an alias for your existing email id at. http://edit.yahoo.com/config/list_alias?.src=ym. . Getting alias would not change anything for the acocunt, you will still get mails in the same account.. . you can ask people to send you mails on the new id that you got, but if someone sends it on the old, that is not a problem either.Create a new one
In my case it was because I think of myself as a grumpy person. So that would represent the real me.. . Some might do it because they want people to think that they are not particularly nice.That's like asking why do some people have glasses on in their avatar, it's about expressing yourself individually and what you think looks good.because some people are unhappy in life so it shows in thier avatarthey are not happy. why does your avator wear sun classes.... do you were them all the time? :-)Sometimes life for the aviator sucks! sometimes they just broke it off with the Aviator they've been seeing for awhile - maybe they where fired for being late or maybe they just need a break and cant get one cause they didnt save up enough money before they got fired and cant get a vacation! LOLbecause not everyone is the same. they want to be different.
if you mean the yahoo toolbar, far better to remove it from your system rather than just hide it. In Windows Control Panel, double click on ADD OR REMOVE PROGRAMS. You will get a list of all installed software, simply select the yahoo toolbar & click remove.if you have SBC Yahoo! DSL, go to the top where it says sidebar and click hide. I hope this helps! :)Above the sidebar is a button that says "sidebar."  :o)  Click on it and it will disappear.go to view/toolbars.... it' in the left - up side of the monitor... near file and edit
Yep, just click the switch, and be sure to select the previous response as best answer also.There is a "switch back" link at the top of the beta. This will allow you to go back to the original yahoo mail.
Bug squashed! We traced the problem to one of our database servers, which crapped out on us last night. That had a few other effects, which you all just helped us pinpoint. We've now cleaned them up.. . Thanks for your reports, everybody.Today everyone is in luck. Yahoo Answers is probably having some maintanence problems. Luckly there are a ton of these questions to get 2 points onThat happens to me too!! I was wondering the same thing. Hmmmm....me too........The same thing is happening to me.  it must be everyone.I am glad I am not the only one. They need to fix that glitch quickly otherwise there will be a lot of open questions to answerThis is a BETA version.  There are still some kinks that obviously need to be worked out.yep its happenin to me 2Yeah, same here. I bet it's just a glitch.. . -Kitty13Hi!!!. I speak here not for the website itself, but for me as a person who's probably enlightened with it..probably, because I'm not sure whether my answer is really right...that might happen because it was program that way.as we may observe, there are often times a number indicated right after the note that there are other open questions.... as far as technology is improving, computers can't still think as man do at all apects.... so it follows what it is designed by the programmers..... also, as long as i do know, the questions they input in the "ALL CATEGORIES" are those chosen questions which are common to almost everybody.... in general, everything I said are just probable instances only..the answer lies solely to those who programmed this website.....just try asking them...
Go to extra's and click on Holidays and events. Then go to Haloween and they give you different kinds of costumesu have to look for it on the avatar clothing line
2006, never have asked a question, answered my last one sometime today, a long time, no rewards yet, no idea, etc. etc.Not enough... the reward is that I am getting whiter sitting inside in front of a computer.  Pretty soon I won't need a light.  My own glow will light the room.not much. i havent got anything...imjust found this web site by accident.. this is my first.. i ask about how to sell more cars.first i dont know what google is.. just is case you are instered in purchasing a new or used car contact me. . best to youi have 151 points. when i click submit I have 2 more. By the way i am the 5'7 blonde. e-mail me at kc.blondesrule@gmail.com!i'm young 240, answered a questipn seconds ago. Level 3 days now.. Are there any rewards?456...i ask questions like every day this is one but i answered 10 before this.....i dunno how long it took me.....i dunno!!!953, but I will have 2 more after I click "submit". I think I've been using Y! answers for about 2 weeks. I usually get points for my answer being chosen as best cuz I know a lot about Linkin Park or I have tons of bands to recommend when someone asks if there r any good bands out there (Linkin Park always makes it on to the list). Twice, though, I got twenty points for answering a question in a manner that the asker thought was rude (which it sometimes is), so they picked mine as best and cussed me out in their comment box. I wonder if they realize that they're rewarding my bad behavior with 10 points each time they do that...Not enough..........but I'm working on it :)192, every other day, today, haven't yet, none, just a system to keep you activeWith this answer -- I go to 792!. . Rewards?  None yet -- it's just for fun.. . Yes, I'm pathetic :)I have 7251 points. I ask riddles very frequently but am going to ask more knowledge based questions from now on.. I answer whenever a question appeals to me. I have got no material rewards for this. You will have to see their articles to see what the colors mean.
Beta is a  trial site or program and it is most likely being tested for bugs. They are usually temporary in nature if they are not  working properly. The regular site is the normal site that has already been proven and tested.Beta is like better. :)A beta is the type of fish that i have. :)Beta is the greek letter for B
1 because like 300million people write a lot of letters. 2 postal workers r lazyBecause people have to drive it to other mail places, somtimes they even fly it to other mail centers if it is far enough away. They have fast mail processing machines but the human element is envolved so it is still slow in some aspects.

One of the biggest reasons as to why Yahoo Answers is so addictive is because, The world of information is right at our fingertips. It's not so much that yahoo's Answers is addictive,it's the people on Yahoo Answers that really make it addictive. cool stuff huh!!!I can't answer this, but I definitely agree.. Do you find yourself in conversations saying 'On Yahoo Answers today... ?'because man is insatiablebecause ur hoping there will be somethin u know the answer to that noone else doesI just like helping people. It'd be more fun if the lame questions were easier to ignore though. Here's to future improvements I guess.because u want 2 get 2 the next levelCoz u like to have more points!Sharing knowledge sometimes pushing u to do more research to earn more points and discovering new world of questions every day.y does this question appear so many times??. . read the yahoo answer's blog .. n u'll find out y!
sign out of your current messenger and click on get a yahoo id. it will take you through the steps. if you don't use messenger, sign out of your yahoo home or mail page then click "sign up".Just sign up a new one like you signed up yours.
This is a common problem for people who use fake information when they first create their Yahoo account.  Unfortunately Yahoo requires your birthday to verify your identity before they reset your password.  You could contact Yahoo Account Verification to see if there is anything that they can do for you in this situation. They can be reached by calling 408-349-1572 option 2, option 2.I'm sorry because therea is no way to for you to get your password if you forgot your birthdate,your zip or postal code and country. This is to ensure that your account will not be aesily accessed by other users. I suggest you should make a new account.
Why would you want to do a horrible thing like that!?!?!Just don't go to this website anymore...Just stop answering or asking. Or do you mean the answers that you told people? To delete those you go to the question and click delete on your answer.
maybe you have sickness that occurs in a day.. and suddenly will kill you.the sounds that you hear or your friends hear from you on Y!Messenger depends on the speed of your internet connection... use a high speed connection.... If the problem persists... check you sound card... or your microphone.... be happy!
Geez! is it THAT long?! oh to answer your question, i have no idea whatsoever.It appears that the question period has expired. If you have received an answer that meets your needs, _please_ choose one of those as a 'best answer' as soon as you can; otherwise, this question will go to an automatic vote.

So that people who actually want to ask legitimate questions won't 'waste' their daily quota.  It also gives people an incentive to search for their question in the archives to see if it hasn't already been asked.What do you mean? you must be in level 1 if you can only ask 5 questions per day. As you get into other levels you will gain more number of questions to be possibly answered.I was just about to say the same thing.because ther is so many people and it's hard to keep track.The website would get hectic for the poor Yahoo workers.i think that it is to limit people asking supid ?'s like yours.It is to avoid the Spam.And you wasted 20% of yours on this?. . The more points you accumulate, the more questions you can ask.
Some people answer for diffrent reasons, such as me, wanting to thank you for giving me what I thought was the best tax advise applicable to my personal situation.... ( about W-4 witholdings , line 6 ). . Thank You ! Mark_N_Mary5225@sbcglobal.netpoints! which is why im answeringSome people want points and some are bored and trying have a little bit of fun try not to take it too seriously..just have funI don't know... oh crap, I shouldn't have answered that.points, bored, funWell it is probably a response to some of the rather "dumb" questionsi just do it to get points just because and i dont even know what they r for !I'm not defending all dumb answers, but sometimes I think people are answering with what they honestly believe to be correct answers that simply aren't accurate.  For example, someone on here earlier asked why the Moon doesn't rotate; he mistakenly thought that the Moon didn't rotate because we always see the same side of it.  After reading through the answers, I was shocked to realize that 4 or 5 people actually responded that the Moon DOESN'T rotate, and even gave what appeared at cursory glance to be 'evidence'.  Of course these answers were wrong (the Moon does rotate), but the people giving them were convinced, through their own ignorance, that they were correct.  Hope this helps :)Some people ask really stupid questions so they should be answered with really stupid answers. Serious questions get serious answers.dealing with dumb answers is the chance you take when you post your question.. . deal with it.people want the pointsduh! you do it for the points. some people really think they know what they talking about though.The people above me have already dealt with the points issue, so I'll just add - with all the non-fact-based questions floating around, sometimes when you (non-specific) find a question you feel vaguely qualified to answer, you may feel tempted just to jump in and answer without knowing how correct you really are.. . I did that once and learned my lesson when I realized I was completely off the mark.  Now I try to do my research if I'm not totally sure, although I'm positive I still slip up once in a while.Do you have reason for everything you do in your life? Sometimes some people think maybe even a dumb answer gain them 10 points and it certainly gain them 2 points. Duh
You need to wait at least 24 hours then there will be an option for you to put the question to a vote. . . It is a new feature that was implemented a couple of days ago along with some other annoying little things.If you hav more than 1 answer to your question ,click your question and you will find a "call for vote" option jus below your quesits on your options
Is your messenger still open in the same session? You may be able to get the messages back when you open a conversation window with that person by hitting F3. But in most cases, they're gone for good. Sorry.i think once u deleted it..it will permanently deleted...
Try downloading the image not the html format to your computer and then try uploading it on myspace. When you upload it to myspace click change photo or whatever it says then click browse and find where you saved it then click upload.Yes the answer above is right ,your Avatar isnt in HTML by the ways its Macromedia flash player. I hope you fixed your problem
It is a promotional ploy. You get the domain name only. If you want more bandwidth, space and pages to work with you will have to pay more.hey. just write to the Yahoo! customer care. They will answer you in the best way.
All you have to do is open your trash file if you have deleted the mail, and it should be there still.  If it hasnt been deleted all you have to do is click on the subject line and it should open again.That answer gets my vote.

Go to your 360 website and click on Settings in the top navigation bar. Scroll down to mid-page where it says Yahoo! Identity Display, and choose the second or third option. Your 360 profile will now show up instead of the old one.just white the link of you 360 page in you profile area... i've done the same..
You will need to have a link from one of the emails to go back to the page once. There is no other way to find it. However, once you're at the group website, under the description and above the message list or on the bottom of the messages page, there is a button that says + My Y!. Click on the button to save it to your MyYahoo page for future reference.If the group was created as Private", then it won't show up in the directory.. . Only the group Owner/Moderator can change that setting, and the change would affect the entire group.
In addition, extra programs running in the background on your computer may be using up the memory that Yahoo! Messenger needs to function properly. Please close any extra programs before starting Messsenger again.upgrade to the newest version of YM, then check if you can connect after rebooting windows. if that doesnt work,check your internet connection they might have a firewall up which prevents yahoo from getting in. you can ask your ISP about this.. . cheers.

You can add contacts from your address book to your messenger list, you can also type in someone's email address. But to meet new people, I suggest you go to chat room.

But face sizes are all the same. thats not fair for big people.
I GEUSS SO PEOPLE ARE MORE INTERESTED AND WANT TO GET MORE AND MORE POINTS-I PERSONALLY DONT CARE ABOUT THE POINTS!!To encourage participation and to identify helpful, knowledgeable people.It's that competitive edge.  Most of you are so use to playing computer games that your competitiveness kicks in and it is to encourage you to use their services.i asked this before, no one really knew the answer. but i was wondering why my points at the top of the page were a link, so i clicked it and this is what i found.We get points so we can earn valuable prizes :). . A million points and $1.50 will earn you a cup of coffee!As incentives."To encourage participation"... "reward great answers"... "And they give you another excuse to brag to your friends.". .

If your son sent you an e-card, a message would come to the e-mail address he sent it to. The message will most likely contain a link back to the actual card on the server of whatever host he used.(American Greetings, Jackie Lawson, etc)It appears that the question period has expired.  If you have received an answer that meets your needs, please choose one of those as a 'best answer.'  If you haven't received a good answer for your question, you may want to consider the following,. . 1) Re-post your question.  Newer questions get more activity on Yahoo! Answers than old ones.. 2) If you do re-post your question, consider why it wasn't answered the first time.  Could it be more specific?  Could it be worded better?

You don't get points if yours is the only answer when it expires, you only get points if your answer is chosen, or if there are two answers, it will automatically go to a vote. If yours is the only answer, no points, unless they've changed it, because I haven't gotten points for giving the only answer, which then expires.no, the system isn't broken. you will get the points when the question expires, usually 14 days after it asked. i looked at the question & i do find it weird that the question has expired and you haven't received points. you probably did receive the points, except you just didn't notice them.In the example link, you were one of 2 answeres. In that case it will automatically go to a vote, if the Asker continues to do nothing.. . In a case where you actually are the ONLY answerer, and the asker does nothing, you will eventually get the points.wait'll it expires.  Takes 14 days.  The user can call a vote or vote you the best answer but they may want to wait.I'm not quite sure what your talking about, do you mean at the end of the period the only person with the answers gets the points, like the ten points for the winning answer? That may be true, however, i just answered the question you had as an example so maybe the period isn't over yet?
Do you know the name of the folder? Go to your Start Menu and do a Search for files with that name.

Here's the official link from yahoo on how to delete an account with them. It also says "Please be sure you want to delete your entire account as you will not be able to reactivate it once the account has been deleted. "If you delete your account, you will not be able to get that user name back, nor will anyone else be able to use it.. . Be sure to remove public profiles before closing your account, as you will not be able to do so afterwards.
Yep, just before you log on to Yahoo, below where you type in your ID and password, it says "Don't have a Yahoo ID" - click SIGN UP, and you can set up a new Yahoo ID here.

I am assuming you mean an offline message?  If you have yahoo messenger you open it up click on their user name from your friends list or type it in and type in whatever you want and click send or enter, it will bring up a little box telling you the person is not online right now and they will receive the message when they log in to messenger.You already have Messenger installed, right? Just send them a message as if they were online. Yahoo! will store the message until they get online and will then give them their offline messages.
A mailbox quota is the amount of storage space your inbox can hold.  If you have too many emails stored or just sitting there, it takes up space, which will give you a message telling you that your mailbox quota is full.. Try yahoo mail.  It's almost impossible to fill that sucker up.At internet sites, there often is a limit to the number of emails one can receive before he has to move up in membership status.  He often is required to pay more, or emails past the limit, say 60, will be deleted.
Open Messenger, click on the messenger tab and scroll down to preferences, select general then set up as you want it!

If only people you trust use your computer (or if you are the only one) then you don't need to. But if people you don't trust use the computer then without signing out, they might be able to access your e-mail.Signing out of personal pages, not just for emails, is necessary to do especially when you share computer with others. Take a look in the archive of Yahoo! Answers, how many people asking "My password is stolen, what can do to get it back?" or "Someone is entering my mailbox". One of the reasons they experience such a problem is they do not sign out after dealing with their personal pages in shared computers like in internet cafe or in some office where they are not the only one can access it. Just be very careful with your id and password before you get problem that is no way to be fixed.so that others don't access u'r mails who use the system after u doso othe rpeople see your mail and stuff
The composition of milk is water. energy, protein, fat, lactose, minerals. The amount it this composition of milk varies from specie to specie (cow, buffalo, human lol) . As minerals it contains potassium, calcium, chloride, phosphorus, sodium, sulfur, magnesium, trace minerals and as vitamins it contains vitamin A, D, E, K, B1, B2, B6, B12, C.sugar, protein, water, fat and salt.pus, blood, water, sugar, preservatives..and what ever the cow ate..blah!lactogenmilk, of course!. . ok so i guess that's not exactly helpful... but then there are different kinds of milk, you never know when they're gonna shove a bunch of chemicals or preservatives and all that jazz into your milk.
I don't think there is a way to do it. Maybe you could ask a Yahoo! Answers rep to delete them from your db record or suggest using an if...else construct. If <entry has been deleted then> remove from record else null.There's no option to do this.  It is a good suggestion, though.You can't erase your answers I've tried and failed.

just relax, and tell the person that u have a problem about which you would like to talk about, and say whatever is in ur heart then.depends on what problem you're having.  you should directly to a specialist who's deals with the issues you are having.There's always people, both amateur and professional, who are willing to listen, if you look for them.  Depends on what sort of question it is, of course.  Joe the Bartender always has free advice, which is often worth no more than you pay for it.  Friends and relatives are frequently more willing to listen than you imagine, but there is the problem of telling them what the problem is, which can be a bad idea at times.  (Remember you cannot expect them to forget what you told them, and don't be too sure you can expect them to keep it to themselves.)  . . There are professionals of all sorts, but you need to exercise judgment in going to them.  If you belong to an organized religiion, you can probably find a sympathetic ear in that context, whether or not the one professionally trained for it.  (Maybe the Rabbi is not the one, but the lady who runs the local charity fund-raiser is a nice, sensible person.)  My own instinct is to avoid professionals whenever possible, since they have a point of view imposed by their training, and it may not serve your purposes at all.. . If you can sort out who to talk to, perhaps you can predict what they are going to say, and so you don't need to talk to them.  For years, kids ran around with WWJD on their wrists, meaning "What Would Jesus Do?"  The idea was to do the thought experiment, and figure it out from what you know of his teachings.  After my room-mate died, I developed the slogan WWSS: What Would Steven Say?  Works pretty well, but I have to filter it through the fact that he committed suicide, therefore can be described as a "quitter," and so not good "advice" for all questions.. . Good luck!Only go to a specialist if it a very serious problem. Many of them charge a high price and in reality do nothing that your best friend or your parents couldn't do for you. Then again it does depend on the type of problem. If you don't feel comfortable talking about it with someone you know maybe you could go to a church confesional. I don't know much about them but I would imagine that they would help out (hopefully not by telling you that God will fix all of you problems).be yourself be honest and open and go do it, it is better than holding it in and getting all stressed out, you will feel much better.
It's a way to deter people from asking a bunch of stupid questions.  You might think about asking the question a little more if you know you're going to lose points for asking it.Don't sweat it.. When you select a "BEST ANSWER" you are awarded two points.. So it balances out..whoever did this is sorta stupid cuz it's like they're saying u can't be curious.
Are you referring to SPAM, those unsolicited e-mails, everyone gets? You can have the best spam blockers available, but somehow a number of them escapes the filtering process. It is something we all have to live with.coz someone stupid wants to fool u ....... maybe
mine also periodically takes a very long time to load.  how long do you wait?   perhaps it's the time of day you're on yahoo, some times it really does 'run slow'.  must be all these guys on answers :)It may also help to clear the cache on your computer. That will ensure there is extra memory available so your browser can load the page fully. You can find instructions for doing this at http://help.yahoo.com/help/us/mail/access/access-23.html
the first one becuz this isnt a damn chat room!  if they want to chat then they need to get off of yahoo answers becuz they are on the wrong link thats for sure.  you are not worng for asking this question, the hot guy looking for someone to chat with is probably a 50 year old man whoes wife is taking he nap becuz she cant crawl out from under her hangover long enough to give him some so he is desperatly on a serch to get his balls lit, so he is extremly pathectic.it bothers me too,. you are not alone.. but i think of the more pathetic(that you forgot). is the girls that answer these postsHey Benji....now I'm following YOU........too funny!. . I just wanted to answer that what is most pathetic is that girls actually answer these posts back with their email addresses. Girls.....be careful out there. I'm sure there is a better way to make connections than just randomly telling a complete stranger that you are "hot." Please......respect yourself loves!!you aer pathetic, If this bothers you so much hit report abuse on him or ignore it and move on.Better yet you can answer and talk dirty to him and give him a phoney email adress an get a chuckle out of thinking he is typeing a email to you with one hand.Answer#2 for me, just keep going to next Question, and just live that one alone. There also girls doing it and its not bodering me.I totally agree with you on that one! Guys who post questions like that ARE LOSERS. They just can't find a date. Advice to them: the only girls who will respond to that are not able to get a date either, and they are most likely very unattractive! Or they have bad personalities.. You are not pathetic.totally #1 because its showing that the dude is desprite and is not good enough to find his own girl and he acually needs to ask on the net... i mean i would do it but just for the people that i allready know and i would do it if i would do it if i was deprite but im notThese questions are nothing more than spam and so does the one you asked.No, your right because, if he or she thinks or thought their so hot in the looks dept. then why is he asking over the net and not out and about.Another thing anyone can post a picture that doesn't mean that's really them.They can say yes, yes that's me or i look kinda like that.But, some think is a hook up place and that's why yahoo has the chat rooms for that and they can lie to others and themselves.move along here, nothing to see.. . i just ignore 'em. in their minds, maybe they think they will 'get' a real answer to a question like that on here.  i don't know if pathetic is the word, maybe just sad.. . either way, they bug me too, but i just move along to the next question.Both are sad, nothing you can do to help the poor souls out there desperate for something more than their hand.  . . As for you, move on to the next question, get into an area that you enjoy and the number of those questions diminish greatly.I would have to vote...#1.. . By the way, girl are doing it also.
Right clickt he smiley icon in your system tray (at bottom right corner) and click <Sign In> OR <Show Yahoo! Messenger>...Did you install it properly?. How do I start using Yahoo! Messenger?. There are two steps you need to take to start using Yahoo! Messenger:. . 1. Download and install the software.. This process will take about 16 minutes if you are using a 56k modem, and 25 seconds if you have a high-speed connection. Go to the download page to begin the process. To continue, follow the instructions that appear on your screen. Once the installation is complete, Yahoo! Messenger will open automatically and you will see a window like the one to your right on your desktop.. . 2. Get a Yahoo! ID.. Every person needs a unique ID to identify themselves when using Yahoo! Messenger. After you have installed the program, you will see a Get a Yahoo! ID button where you can sign up for a Yahoo! ID if you do not already have one. If you have already created a Yahoo! ID for any Yahoo! services - Mail, My! Yahoo, Yahoo! Personals, etc. - you can use that for Yahoo! Messenger as well. A Yahoo! ID is the first part of a Yahoo! Mail address - e.g. dairyman88 in dairyman88@yahoo.com. . If you need to sign up for a Yahoo! ID, you will be taken to a web page that asks you to:. . Select an ID (e.g. dairyman88) . Choose a password . Enter a security question in case you forget your password . Enter your name, language, zip code and gender . After completing this process, your Yahoo! ID will be active.. . To sign in to Yahoo! Messenger, type your Yahoo! ID and password into the Yahoo! Messenger ID and password boxes, and then click the Sign In button
It might seem confusing because one thinks the word "break" refers to the mechanical brakes used to stop the vehicle.. . Actually, "break" is used to refer to the "Maximum" an engine can give. Kind of like a "breaking" point in the engine.I think that brake refers to the initial power required to move the vehicle from it state of  inertia . . . Brake Horsepower (bhp) - The measure of horsepower at maximum engine output, minus power lost from heat, friction, expansion of the engine, etc. . brake horsepower. n. (Abbr. bhp or b.hp.) . The actual or useful horsepower of an engine, usually determined from the force exerted on a friction brake or dynamometer connected to the drive shaft.
I just stick my head out the window and yell for them. They usually come running in 5 hours or less, or I just pick up the phone and dial, but I don't have their number, because I haven't had to use them yet.

Use link below in Source(s) - I got over 100 hits for basically the same question.Yeah! you could mark the open e-mail as spam and it'll go straight to your spambox instead of your inbox...go to mail options and there's an option there where you can block an address.. or you can also mark that person's email as spam..
No, I don't think there is a way to see how many you've answered. There should be! They tell you how many more questions you can ask when you ask one, so why not keep you updated on how many you've answered? Great question!just saying thanx fo reply about plants,very helpful and fully appreciatedAt the top of the screenunder the ask, answer, discover links is your name, points, and level.  If you click on your name it goes to all of your information icluding your recent activity on the right hand side.  There you can see how many you've answered and when you answered (i.e.- 2 minutes ago, 2 days ago, etc.).  On that screen if you click on "tell me more" link under My Points, it will take you to the tables where it tells you how many questions you can ask and answer according to your level.  From there you kinda just have to do the math.  Hope that wasn't to confusing!!!You will know when you have answered the set amount of questions for when you have reached the max, you will not be able to submit. YOU WILL KNOW!it will tell you when you run out.
by having random questions show up on the sides of the web page with voting bubbles under them so that whenever someone is on any page on this website they will see the votings and they would be  easily accesable.  just a click away=)Users are starting to ask Tiebreaker Questions. This is helping alot.maybe the points you are awarded? reading through all of the answers is no fun.Yes, make sure your question is in the proper category and has a descriptive question title.. . Unfortunately, people enjoy asking and answering many questions most of the time rather than voting for them. This is one of the reason there are limits to the numbers of questions you can ask and answer each day--to encourage users to vote and rate questions as well. Maybe the vote limits could be increased to encourage people to spend more time doing that.. . You can do your part, though, making sure you take the time to vote on other people's questions. There are a ton of old questions in tie-breaker limbo that you can find by clicking on the date sort link at the top of the unresolved questions page.. . (I'm personally against the tie-breaker questions. There isn't any new question, and yet someone gets ten points for answering it. If a lot of people start doing this, it may start clogging up the site a bit.)It also helps if questions are put in their proper categories.  Some people like to focus on their "speciality" if you will.Put questions automatically to a vote if no Best Answer chosen after a week or so?. . Bugs me, too!

YES YOU CAN! Go to Options > Choose colours on the left > Choose the colour scheme you likeumm i don't think you can. but if you can i don't know how. but like in the compose thingy you can add backround color. Then you can put background on 'My Yahoo!'. hope the info helps!
I guess its to stop kids from wasting their school time in messenger when they ought to be getting the education they are entitled to.They have it configured that way and locked out so only an administrator can have that privilege.

If there were fat avatars, how many people would actually use them?  Probably not very many.Actually, quite a few users have asked this question, in all seriousness.  We think they have a point--we're not all built thin.  Answers doesn't design the avatars, but we'll pass on your comments to those who do.  Thanks!Haha good question. Maybe they should make an option so that you're able to change the avatar's body size. I want to make my avatar's boobs bigger.
One of Yahoo! Answers' rules is that you lose 2 points everytime you ask a question. You can get these points back by choosing a best answer.It's to discourage junk questions while at the same time encouraging users to choose a best answer or put the answers up to a vote before the seven day limit (you get back your two points when you do this).To get points back, you can also answer a question(thanks 4 the points!).I think Yahoo! wants to encourage you to answer questions, and share your knowledge instead of just gaining knowledge, so they penalize you for asking questions and reward you for helping others.Because that's the way the Yahoo Answers people made the game.u pay for the questions with 2 pointsThat's just the way it is!yep he's right. ^that's how it works dude,. ask a question, -2 points. answer a question, +2 points. choose best answer 4 your question, +2. call for a vote for best answer to your question, +2 (+1 pt. 4 voting urself). get ur answer choosen as best answer, + 10 points. vote for an answer, +1 point. vote on weather you agree with the best answer or not, +1 point. trust me on this, how do you think i'm sooo close to level 3 & i've only been at this 4 about 2 weeks.. . by the way, thanx 4 at least 3 points bro!
hmmmm, since this is the YM section, I guess u want to know how to send one, on YM.. . It's part of the "CALL Computer" function.  When you CALL someone - if they haven't answered after about 6 rings (22 secs) then you should hear a lady's voice inviting you to "leave message after the beep".. . Just talk for up to 120 secs, then when done click SEND - wait maybe 10-20secs while it says "Sending...", then the job is complete.Voicemail is an amalgamation of voice and mail.  Most commonly linked to the 'answering machine', voicemail is a recording of a voice through highly technical 'sound waves'.  These 'sound waves' can travel at nearly the 'speed of sound'.  The speed of sound is roughly 1/2 the speed mach 2.
there like the cops, they'll tell you all nicely they'll find your lost bike or car. But when you leave they'll go back to their own business.They're already working on a messaging system for Answers, so you don't have to worry about contacting them.. . For now, just keep your contact details filled out in your profile and check the other person's profile, or add comments on the question page.You can't unless the user has put their address in their profile like I have.. . Here is the link for giving feedback to the Yahoo Answers Team:. http://add.yahoo.com/fast/help/us/answers/cgi_feedbackI've already suggested it. But, you should too. Maybe the more people who suggest it, they might add it.

any large tub and use clay natural clay like the one used in artsculpture.have funtearing out and replaceing seems too radical.

It is the width.  Generally, the "average" width for a woman is B and for men "C" or "D."  Different shoe companies are slightly different, but widths, very generally look something like this:  AAA, AA, A, B, C, D, E, EE, EEE, EEE.  Of course, not every company makes all those widths!  A "C" in one company equals the "D" in another company.  It's best to become familiar with the terminology of the specific company.How wide the shoe/boot is for the feet.  eee is very wide.I may be wrong, but I believe the 'e' has to do with the width. The more e's, the wider the shoe.. . I think I think... I hope I don't look like an idiot on this one...

I think this might explain what your problem is: You have 100 IDs already being ignored in Messenger.  Messenger will ignore people after that, but not record the usernames in the ignore list.  Delete some names from there, and ignore your pest.  It should stick as long as they are using the same ID.This may sound like a stupid response, but make sure you're ignoring their screen name, not just their nickname.Well ive had a person jump on different screen names and annoy me my best advice would be to geta new  sn or email account but alter ur addresses and phone number so that the person wont know its u thats what i have to say.Try reporting the individual for harrassment.

When the history list on the search bar is dropped down, rest your pointer on the item you want to delete, and it will be highlighted. Just press the delete key on your keyboard.Everyone seems to ask this question.. Just stop looking at things you're not supposed to or things that are embarrassing.. Or you can reformat your computer.. Other than that, I have no idea.. . Funnybunny is talking about the history, but the places on the actually address bar, I have no idea how to get rid of.go to your computer history icon and delete it..its should be the clock with the arrow around it

<Click on the sent folder to see if it was sent.. The only way I know to tell if they read your email on Yahoo is to install a program such as "Did They Read It".When you use DidTheyReadIt, e-mails that you send are automatically and invisibly tracked. The instant the recipient opens your message, DidTheyReadIt automatically notifies you.. . You can get a free trial version at the site below.You can see if it has been sent by going to "Sent" folder, you can only find out if it has been read, if you request a "Read Reciept", and I am not sure that is possible to do with the web interface to Y mail <<??>>find out by checking your "Sent" folder.

If you haven't received a good answer for your question, you may want to consider the following,. . 1) Re-post your question.  Newer questions get more activity on Yahoo! Answers than old ones.. 2) If you do re-post your question, consider why it wasn't answered the first time.  Could it be more specific?  Could it be worded better? Were there grammatical or spelling errors? Was it in the best category?. . If it doesn't seem likely that re-posting your question will help you, then here's a listing of my favorite 'answer sites'.

You get your two points back when you either choose a best answer or put the question up to a vote.. . However, the two-point deduction still discourages people from asking questions that aren't necessary and hopefully also encourages them to use the search button to see if the question has been asked before.You aren't punished.  You get it back when you choose a best answer in a couple days.  That way, you will likely choose a best answer, rather than leave it up to someone who doesn't know / doesn't care.  Also, you will be encouraged to come back to the site and participate again.. . Hope to see you in a couple days!  Don't forget to come back and choose the best answer.  It'll get your two points back!!

Snoring is a bad problem and it can ruin your sinuses. So get a nasel spray for your nose from your doctor.You post this question over and over again, even worse, under the wrong category. Would you please find how this site works first before getting involved in it? It's annoying, you know.Are you overweight? Do you have sinus problems? . . "How Can I Prevent Snoring? . . Consider losing some weight: Most snorers tend to be overweight, and shedding excess fat has been shown to substantially decrease -- if not eliminate -- snoring.. Avoid midnight snacks and alcoholic beverages: Drinking alcohol or eating heavily before going to sleep causes muscles to slacken.. Avoid sleeping pills or other sedatives: Although they put you to sleep, they relax your neck muscles, making your snoring worse.. Stop smoking: Smoking causes nasal and lung congestion, a major cause of snoring.. Sleep on your side: While heavy snorers will snore in any position, moderates tend to snore only when sleeping on their backs. One way to avoid this is to sew a pocket onto the back of your nightclothes and insert a tennis ball, which will make it uncomfortable for you to lie on your back and prompt you to turn on your side during sleep.. Sleep without a pillow: By putting a kink in your neck, pillows can contribute to airway obstruction."
Combine the previous three answers, and you've got a winner!  Thanks, everyone.  (And yes, Jane's reporting is right...that rumbling you hear is the sound of code tumbling into place....)Try typing in the name in the IM screen.. . However, a lot of people created a custom nickname for the site that won't work in messenger. Make sure you've checked in their profile by clicking on their name or associated picture to see if they've left contact details.. . The Y! Answers team is also working furiously on a instant message system for the site. I'm not sure when it will come out, but as they said yesterday, "It may be sooner than you think."Most you can do is try the answerers names. But since a lot of people change them for Y!Answers they probably aren't right. Some people don't change em tho.people ask this the whole time i wish there was a wayYou should give yours first together with your questions, and the answerer will communicate with you if they feel necessary., like in my earlier answer to your question on donation of guitars to you.God Bless You,bye.go to there email address and write to them and ask them for it
go through and delete all your info and all your friends, and be sure to uncheck the button that activates simple URL.Then when anyone clicks your profile it should take them to your regular old profile, not your 360. That's as close as you can get for nowBecause 360 is not "just" a blog page - it's meant as a whole Yahoo Profile (though I think they overdid it a bit, hence many many upset users like you).. . Answer#1 is correct... or for good further info look here: http://answers.yahoo.com/question/?qid=1006022406405&r=w
not sure but check your email. x x x x x x x xEither your internet broswer or its security settings aren't allowing you to see the html editing tools used by Yahoo! Mail. Switch to text editing mode by:. . 1. Click the "Options" link in the upper right of your Mail page.. 2. On the Options page, in the "Management" column, click on "General Preferences".. 3. Find the "Composing E-mails" section, "Mode:", and choose "Compose messages as plain text".. 4. Scroll to the bottom and click the "Save" button.My answer: O. E. Operator Error. You are not that nieve to figure out how to work yahoo email. There are two reasons for this question: 1. You just asked a simple question to get as many responses so you can move up the ladder. 2. All your emails you are sending or forwarding to is all wrong, which you will still recieve a mail-daemon if you wrote the wrong email address. Which then sends me back to my first assumption which is O.E.
The buttons?. Nobody else sees them, they are there to give you a chance to correct misspellings or if you think of something you would like to add a way to add to your answer as you cannot answer the same question twice.You don't have to worry about that button. You are the only one able to modify your question.I wanted to answer this, but somehow Benji Man got to it first.  So I'll just repeat, . . No one else can see them.  They are there for you, and you alone.Only you can see them below your own posts. No one else can delete or edit your posts from their account.
In your mail account. look to the left side and you will see all of your old folders(mailboxes).

It's not the easiest way but that all what I know.
LOL step one...stand, step two...reach for the power button....REACH!!! YOU CAN DO IT!!! step three...WALK AWAY!!!Try turning off your computer. It works great.Yeah, I'm here a lot, too.  But, I just started, and like a lot of things, it gets old after a while.  I bet that will happen to you too.  Just make sure you get up in between and do your work or chores or whatever. You know...eat, sleep, don't ignore your family. But, by all means, get right back on here, man!it a ver simple thing to do just sign out and delete all answers you get from the Yahoo!Answers in your mail box simplewell onlt 1 hr is not long i dont think you have a addiction you ae amazed at this great machine if you really dont want to lossyou willEvery time you start to type a question, ask yourself "Do I really care about the answer?" and "Can I find better information somewhere else?". . Every time you give an answer, ask yourself "Will somebody give this person a better answer?", "Does this answer really matter to the person asking it?" and "Is my time better spent doing something else?". . After you've done that, ignore the answers, forget about the rest of your life. Your life belongs to Yahoo! Answers now.Why are you asking us? We are all here too. Probably just as addicted.Cold turkey, it's the only way.I don't think that you can! I'm addicted to this too!Just an hour???  I LIVE here now lol. . :)No kidding- the first 3 days I was on here way more than I should have been. . . I am limiting myself to answering only a few a day, not the limit that I can.  . . It's just so much fun helping other people like this!  Good luck, and go to bed!  :-)
I notice mine crashes if I stay in an active chatroom too long. It's like my machine is getting "full" (of krap). Then, I go to a small room populated by 3 cold, no chatting bots and, my machine cools down.. Mostly tho, to avoid crashing, I simply limit my time in the chatrooms and log off, out of messenger.the problem is on your network provider. you'vr got to tell the problem to your systems administrator.related to the network you are currently in or most probably ym is infected. try to reinstall ym again.the problem is on your side.
if you use yahoo...go under options (upper right corner).  then click on general preferences and you can change your name from there.What kind of email client or  service do you use?

Under "Personal Information" on the bottom half of the window click "Auto Complete". Uncheck "Web Addresses", "Forms" and "User Names & Passwords on Forms". That prevents the Search History from being kept. To erase what's already there then below that click the "Clear Forms" and "Clear Passwords" buttons. Then click on "OK", click "Apply" and click "OK" again to close the window and save your settings.. . If you are using Firefox, click "Tools", then "Options" then "Privacy" then "Saved Forms".

This is another good suggestion. Answers is still in Beta and so everything hasn't been completely developed yet, but you can use the 'Tell us what you think' link at the bottom of the screen to send your ideas or discuss it in the Answers forum (link at upper right of the screen).i wonder the same thingI would like to see the Hamster answering this Q. Aren't we worthy for you, to do so?. . KaterinaI agree that would be cool.

Resolved questions stay on the system permanently, so future users can benefit from them.  The idea is, later users can build on the contributions of earlier users, rather than having to re-invent the wheel.. . So, you're one of the founding Great Minds of Answers, and you're stuck with it!  :-)if you satisfied with the answer you already got , in 24 hour later you can pick the best answer and you will get your 2 point back , but like other people say we are all stuck with the resolved question , so just let it be, and don't be botherthey'll stay around.  so will your deleted questions.  only option is to cover 'em up with new ones! :-DYou don't,sorry!They stay at your Q&A page forever...If you have a variety of answers you can close out the question.  If there's only 1 answer, you must wait 24 hours to close the question.apparently we are stuck with them
I would cut and paste the text of the message into a fresh message page.  (Rather the reverse of the previous guy's answer.)just highlight it and press backspace
Questions are usually left open for seven days before automatically going to a vote. The asker can choose a best answer or put it up for a vote before then (but not until 24 hours after asking the question). A question will stay up for voting for another days.. . So, a question doesn't get resolved for two weeks without the asker taking any initiative.most of your questions are resolvedthey have to wait in order to select the best answer so it might take a while for them to get resolvedThe person who asked it has not selected a best answer and the voting has not yet completed.

check your web filters.. you would have to disable that.. I do have a web filter that I must temporarily disable to ask questions.I don't have that problem on Yahoo Answers, but I do on other sites so I've made a habit of always copying my answer to the clipboard [ctrl+a, ctrl+c] before I post it. That way I don't have to try to remember it and retype it.

there are many organizations that tell you what you need to do. also, something like writing a letter or sending  a drawing would be fun. troops are mostly bored when they are not in action, so magazines, crossword books, word games and more would be goo d ideas i think.When I was in the service what boosted my morale the most was a letter from home especialy from a child as these seamed the most sincere. Opperation dear abby is a good venue to send some kind words of support and appreciation to the military men and women overseas.Maybe you can make it a school project any get kids in your classroom  and school make it a project.i  would   send  them  cards and  food  that  doesnt rot if . they  have   phones  you can  send  some  calling  cards.my  brother  is  in  the  navey  and  even  though its  hard  to  let  go  hes  doing  a great  job!You can connect the adopt a platoon organization on ways you can helpI like "somerandomin..." answer, but the red cross can help and depending on where your at there are groups out there. I know someone in mankato, mn. They sent over some booze. But you have to hide it good. They loved it I guess. But don't put a return address if you try to do that.Go to the red cross in your area.  you can volenteer to help them.  They are always sending stuff over there.  Also if any of you are involved in a church, work with them, if there is a youth orginazation, you can most likely get a lot more done, with more of you then just a few.  I'd have to say, I'm shocked.  In America, in 2006.... Someone wants to do good... Best of luck to you!I would just enlist now. They'll need replacements as soon as we invade Iran.they can raise money and send it over seas,or they can buy calling cards to sent to them so they can call their families.enlist when you are 17.  Also send American cigarettes.  Do a google search for "penpals US Army" and go from there.The best gift you can give them is to study hard and make the most of the opportunities their sacrifice opens for you.

Yahoo will let you define multiple email addresses for a single mailbox. The feature is in Mail Options -> Mail Addresses.  That basically gives you a new Yahoo id.. .

I think all you have do is put acheck in the box andpush delete and it shoud bring up some more and keep on clickingand deleteing. I have done it I have never had that many but it should work.yep, that'll work if u want to delete ALL your mails which are in ur inbox.
It depends on what kind of e-mail he has. If he uses a client such as Outlook, it's resident on his PC and he can't access it anywhere else. If he uses web-based e-mail such as Yahoo, he can sign in from anywhere.depends where his email is ... but go to the home page of the service his email is. There should be a way to sign in and check it.what is his provider, but almost all providers offer free webmail, so try and go to the website of the service provider (ex. gmail.com   aol.com   yahoo.com   hotmail.com). and log on (there shouls be some link somewhere that says either log on or email or webmail)

Maybe the top 5,000 members (which the Answers Team said it would only go to) are only on level 2 or higher. I wish they made an easier way to scroll through that leaderboard.Hehe Prior to this one the leaderboard only showed the top 5 or 10.  This is a HUGH improvement.I suppose otherwise it wouldn't be a leaderboard it would just be a list of all users.
The email address you are forwarding it to might be deleted, or maybe you typed it wrong. Another possibility is that the person's email account is full.. .  Hope this helps. :-)Maybe the adress is invalid, or you are doing it wrong.
Yahoo! does not have a big enough staff to monitor every room, sorry.the chat services they provide are free, as well as this forum you're complaining in.  lighten up and just hit the ignore button on those bots and get on with your life.

You will have to create the custom picture yourself using your photo editing software and then add it to your Yahoo! 360 account. Once that's done, go to your Q&A, click on Edit Profile and then there will be an option to use your Yahoo! 360 picture.Thanks to Jane_Furrows for a clear and complete answer.The frowny face that JimmyR has is a custom picture.  I think it's pretty cool, too.Yeah, the upside down face is cool but, be orginal and keep yours.
If you are using a HTML format for your mails, it should be possible to link to a picture from the web, say from Yahoo photos or Flickr by using HTML tags <img src="url for photo">, whereever you want in the body of your email. This is easy with Outlook or PC based email programs, but the above method works for Yahoo Mail and GMail.Which email program, is html availible?
It could be that your CPU usage is going to 100% - it happens to me a lot.  It can be from having too many programs, or some of the programs do not release all their memory when they close (Microsoft keeps the information on how to do that a secret except for their own products).  You may have to just try a power-off or restart to release the memory, then try again.The previous answer was correct. Programs will often not run properly when there is not enough available memory on your computer. Be sure to close all unneeded programs before starting Yahoo! Messenger, and update and run your anti-virus software to be sure that it isn't something else using up your memory.
because if it wasnt for us woman you men wouldnt even be born we go threw alot more than men we should rule the world think about itthey dont, not yet. but as of right now, the best female leaders(or female's that have acheived a lot in their life or professian) are oprah winfrey, hilary clinton, condeliza rice, hilary duff, sandra day o'connor, and many othersThis question will make more sense if you chage it to "Why do woman THINK they rule the world?". . And you are proving by putting this question under "Yahoo Messenger" category...fk off !!!
Nice pix, Darius. ;-). 360 displays simply your "latest" photos from your Flickr - so the only way you could change their display sequence is perhaps to remove some from Flickr then re-add them.. . (Or of course you can change 360 to display only the latest four, or the latest three - but it will still always be simply the LAST ones you added there).go to profiles or preferences to change your pix.
Why are you asking it here, where you should know?!Try anywebcam.com for real people and chat from across the world.ask or go to yahoo chat room. Most people who have cams have pictures of a cam beside their nameuse aimyou can go to the chat rooms and if there are ppl in there with with cams then it will show a t.v by thier names.
It depends purely on how they choose to show their ID on 360.. . They MAY actually show their normal Yahoo ID there, or they may in fact put ANYTHING there, in which case there is NO WAY you can trace that 360 page back to a particular Yahoo Id.. . (I think Yahoo have deliberately designed it this way, for better or worse.  So although one's 360 is based on one's Yahoo Id, it doesn't necessarily let people FIND that Id !)just append @yahoo.com to their profile names.
Y 360 is on the Yahoo tool bar, on the drop down menu next to the big Y on the left its under "connect with others". . and also on the main tool bar. Click on the tool bar pencil icon go to Personal options/Add edit buttons and you can put the 360 icon on the main part of your tool barThe previous response tells you exactly what to do. Please select it as best answer.
If you want a gmail account, send a mail to erekit83@gmail.com. I can invite you to use it since I have 98 invitation left.. . Its size is bigger than yahoo.

Gmail just gives you a wider range of options and once you get used to the "Labels" and not folders, it is great.

you mean your not recieving all the messages? how do you know you arent? i nvr get that.There is probably something wrong with the connection on either your side or on the side of the person who is sending the message. If either of you have dial-up, it may not be transferring the message completely or take a while before the message arrives. Or if you have an old computer, it could time out the message also.
Open up your email and in the upper right corner click on options. Under Management, click on General Preferences. Enter your new From Name and click save.In your mail account click on the Options button in the top right corner.Then click the General Preferences button and change your "From Name".

Well, if you mean sound (voice) just turn the volume down on your computer.  (Normally in the bottom right corner.)try using LimeWire, they'll probably have an older version, but wait, actually, not even, Yahoo doesn't allow you to install it so you're out of luck. try downloading Trillian, they are way better, you won't need that voice thing, it usualy takes all the messengers names and jumbles them up as one messenger, that would be your best bethttp://www.oldversion.com/program.php?n=yahooyou might have to look in an obselete programs download site, i believe the only version of messenger you can download from yahoo rite now is the one with voiceJust don't use it.  What's the problem?
Asking them is the easiest, least invasive way...  Chances are you need to know a whole lot more info on the person to find out where they were born without just asking them...try google

mast head gives you only the last actions points.... you can't see more than the last six details on the right.. . and you are here now coz someone picked you as best answer, thumb up your best answer,since thursday...and congratulations....still 200 points to be with ya...lolThe masthead only gives information about the last 6 point gains.  These are the ones listed in detail.There is no activity list that goes back more than 6 actions.. . The only way to see what is up with the rest is to open them one by one to see which got best answer.  Or in general you can just look at your lists.  Each list of Q&A's on your page, will indicate, whether they are open, in voting. or resolved.Think of it as a bonus for past achievements.... . Also, you can look back, starting from the first questions that you ever answered...The masthead only gives information about the last 6 point that you got. The rest is not shown. But people must have voted your answers the best!:-) Good job!Are you sure you had only 90 points on Thursday? That doesn't seem possible considering you've answered 683 questions. You probably earned all those points without even noticing it.you got lucky... :-). sometimes you get points (people picking your answers as the best) and it doesnt show all of it.By being obsessed, no offense though. The guy who reached level seven is worse.
Caveman gives great answers. I am not sure how the yahoo staff picks featured users. We have to trust their judgement, they must have found cavemans answers interesting... Dont be bitter about it, this site is supposed to be a fun place to learn and share knowledge..Just keep up the good work of answering questions, helping others should be the main goal....Richard has well over 17,000 pts and has NOT been featured yet.. . I asked the same question acouple of days ago.. . http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=ApgeHmhPP5Ytmc6ViR8E_BDsy6IX?qid=1006020401362. . I of course, reported Doc Armalite for abuse.Interesting question... Maybe it's because he doesn't diversify and just sticks to the specific topics... Maybe he answered a majority of the questions in those topics.You people need to get a life.That has bothered me too, because I am at 3 and working my tail off to get to level 4, giving good thoughtful answers and getting a lot of my answers chosen as best.Please see our answer here: http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=1006020604923
techincally software may not be able to find install.log which is necessary to uninstall as it contains every information of software so just install the same version software then u can uninstall it.. or after reinstalling ur problem may vanish due to which u r trying to uninstall it.Why can't I install yahoo messenger?. .

It depends on what the question is and whether the person asks for an explaination. If they ask a very simple question, I give a simple answer. If it is more complex I usually give an explaination, etc.It is not a requirement!Well it really depends on the question. Some do not need reasoning behind the question because some are too simple to even justify explaining why you came to that conclusion.I guess it's a matter of taste or thinking that not doing so will allow them to answer more questions. My practice in the month that I have been answering questions is to try and answer fully but succintly. I normally attach sources that I consider to be reliable so that people know where the information came from and have somewhere to look for more information to assist them. Hopefully, this approach maximises best answer status but the main reason is getting the satisfaction of providing the best answer you can and helping someone.Bro I'm a walking Ecyclopedia !!!Because there IS no reasoning behind their answer.  Duh!
Most categories can be altered depending on how many questions are being asked in those categories. If you think it's enough, try suggesting it through the 'Tell us what you think' link at the bottom of the page.because running isn't a true sport. it's just moving your legs which everyone can do. it is nothing special
If you're talking about your Yahoo! avatar, right clicking won't give you the option to "save as".. Open your 360 if you have one, that's where your avatar shows largest (or any page that it's on if you don't have a 360) and  click "print screen" on your keyboard. Open your paint and go to edit, click paste, and crop out your avatar.Now go back to file and click save as.just press save on the avatar site!Can't unless you print screen it and then use paint and take only that part and then save. then right click on your desktop and goto properties then goto screensaver and click browse and find your photonvr did it but i think u sud jus right click and save picture as.... . . that sud work :)Does right click/save as picture work?1. on your browser menu click on file -> save as. 2. double click the folder created on your desktop. 3. on the menu click view, then thumbnails.. . select your avatar to save. that's it!!You can't. It's a Flash animation, not a picture. If you really wanted it, you could get a free screenshot software. See my sources.
If you are referring to your own status, then you can change that in the preferences window.  If you are referring to other people in your friends list, then you cannot change theirs.  They have to do something to switch from being idle.Go to their computer and wiggle their mouse.Log on to yahoo messenger and click messenger menu..then click preferences and select <Privacy>... uncheck the <show me a idle if i dont use computer for ___ minutes... click <OK>... . . This will make u never appear idle on yahoo messenger...i
Search the web implies that you are using some search bar. you should be able to click on the icon for that search bar and choose delete. if you mean the address bar you will need to click on tools>internet options and click clear history. that will clear all of your history and clear your address bar of all history. i dont get paid to answer your question or i would tell you how to use regedit to selectivly delete items in the address barThis is an guide with screenshot on how to clear your search history, check it out! . http://www.jimmyr.com/searchhistory.php. . . You can also scroll down and hit delete on the ones you dont wantYou can't. you can either clear all of it, or none of it.you an right click and delete individual itemsgo to: My Coputer >> C: (or D:) depends on where is win xp installed. go to Documents and settings >> then open the folder which have the same of the user account >> then Local settings >> History.

Step 2, Hold a giant magnet to your computer. Step 3, ENJOYHmmmmmmm.... been looking at bad stuff huh? well here it is just click the history icon at the top of the screen. Then click on the specific webpage(s) at the left of the screen and click delete.
You click tools on your internet explorer tool bar. Go to Internet options -> click on Content -> click on Autocomplete -> Untick the tick in the box next to forms and also click on the clear forms.. . Your whole internet hisory is still there, but the yahoo search and autocompletes are erased. Hope that helps.Easy, if you have yahoo toolbar, click on the thing that looks like a pencil, and it is right there, it says clear recent searches, and it does.
You have to be 18+ to use the chat feature in messenger. Even then, there is less adult material to cut down on some of the illicit activity going on.Wait till you are 18 or when you click Adult it will warn you and ask if you are 18.Click I agree and your in. I wouldnt go in there though if you are not 18 or older. You could get into trouble and you may see stuff that you are not ready for.Its ok being curios but the 18 rule is there to Protect under 18.
The previous response is absolutely correct. Please select it as best answer.That's your Yahoo id.  If you have an internet service that's part of Yahoo (like SBC) your whole email address is your Yahoo id. So if your email is myname@sbcglobal.net, that's your Yahoo id as well.  There's a way to make a new yahoo ID and link it to that email if you don't want the address to show.
Actually you ARE in control and you gave them permission.  You will most likely have to right click on their name in your Buddy List, select stealth settings, then select permanently offline.  This will not stop incoming IMs (you will have to ignore for that) but it will keep them from seeing you online.  You have no more control over someone elses Buddy List then they have over yours.Goto your cookies in the preferences of your webbrowser and see if you can find their email or site or whatever it is and remove it.  That might help?  Or you can contact the HELP site of your webserver or of Yahoo Messengers program and ask them a polite way of removing oneself from a chat list.  That would definetely know.  . Good luck!You should block them. If you really don't want them on your list you should put them in the block section.Just IGNORE him (put his ID on your ignore list in the preferences menu).of course if you have added someone on 360 you can remove them and you are taken off their list. there are buddy remover programmes available for Y Messenger but they dont allways work ,just block them or mark yourself permanantly off line to them(that by the way is what I do with my mother LoL)
Maybe you changed the setting of text size by mistake! Go to view on the IE top menu scroll down to text size choose medium! Some times these changes when new software is loaded good luck!only yahoo team can tell
Once you put it to a vote, you can not.  It has to run its course from there.. . If you want to be able to resolve it yourself, do not put oit to a vote. Choose a Best Answer yourself.Do you mean pulling out your question in midst of the voting process?. Sorry but I don't think their is any way to do it. Once you call a vote, your question is opened for voting till it gets resolved.
Yep, just use the Print button on the page.Have you clicked "Printable View"? If not, that's why.
No idea.. . Guess: Because you spilt coffee all over your keyboard !?. . Perhaps if you gave some DETAILS then someone might be able to help !It could be something wrong with Yahoo's server, but it's more likely your firewall/proxy server settings need to be configured properly. Try following the instructions at http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/messenger/signin/signin-47685.html to see if that works for you.

I had the same problem this morning,I even asked a question here about it.Last night the system was working just fine but this morning I voted for four undecided questions and didn't get the points for it.I gave up and am back now.I'm getting the points for what I'm doing now but the ones from this morning didn't show up!I have no idea about what to do and hope someone from Yahoo! could see what is going on.You should get points for voting. I've noticed that sometimes it's a bit delayed but you usually get your points eventually.yea you should get points... you will in a bit i bet!Guys, we've answered this question here: http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AswCgC7zxZo4CKtNpaTXgrQq0KIX?qid=1006020302320 .

Acid rain can be very bad in areas of high automobile use and down wind of any location burning high sulfur fuels.  Anything that lowers the rate of burning fuel will improve the problem.  This is difficult in our culture and with the current federal administration.. You should also research natural sources of acid rain.  Land down wind of heavy forests also get acid rain.  This is a recent finding, but you should be able to research the topic.You will more than likely get a better response to this question if you post it in an appropriate category, such as "Science & Mathematics > Weather" instead of "Yahoo! Products > Yahoo! Answers."I agree with "SuperTaz". . try to post questions in the proper category.You mean "ACID" rain?  :). The less contaminants in the atmosphere, the less acid rain.  This is virtually impossible since there are more and more cars, chemical plants, etc... pumping these toxins in the air every year.  . :(acid rain man...thats neat next time it rains i plan on standing out side with my wouth open till it stops...what a trip...I'm afraid it'a too late already. But if everyone uses less their car for their movement and if the cars use alternative fuels then we may have a chance. Thing is though that not only we don't lessen our movement and waste emission we double them every day :(
I think what you want to do is edit your profile, removing some or most of the information, and leaving those categories blank.  Have you become concerned about privacy, or are you regreting way you created your profile?  Perhaps you want to put more serious answers in to substitute for smart-alecky ones.This question has been asked here on Answers many times.. Anyway, the answer should be here: http://www.wackyb.com/zzub/index.php?showtopic=8601&pid=94635&st=0&#entry94635
Google is the better if you want a free mail.. Google is faster than Yahoo because Google has only text ad. Google is more usibility than Yahoo because Google has one-click operations such as reply, forward, attach files. Google is bigger with capability. Yahoo's capability is 1 GB. Google's capability is 2.6 GB and continues increasing.. Google is more scability. Google has POP|IMAP access and Forward email service. Google is more globalility. Google supports many languages with check grammars. Google is more powerfull with mobile. You can read mail with . attached text file from mobile support WAP. Google extracts text from text file such as .DOC, .PDF. Google supports chat in Gmail.. But I prefer Microsoft mail than bothBoth Yahoo and Google are the only top companies in the Inter which give lot of services to their customers.. but being on the yahoo site and answering from the yahoo website I cannot say Google is better then yahool.. . I dont have Gmail and I do not plan to have Gmail.. I already have lots of free emails with 250MB space and almost same services.I personally use both, but I prefer Gmail. Gmail gives a wider range of options, and it is relatively easy to get an invite - you ususally can just ask on a forum such as this and someone will send one to you. I have sent some to people.... . Gmail just gives you a wider range of options and once you get used to the "Labels" and not folders, it is great.My guess is Gmail. Yahoo is very slow. Everyone says it's my computer, but it's not slow on anything but yahoo. Therefore, it's not my computer or internet service. Also, yahoo will not answer any of their help e-mails. I've ask for help 3 times and never get an answer.
Yahoo! Messenger works fine without using the voice option. I've never used voice on mine.no longer an option. yahoo messenger with voice is now standard.
Just go to the category you want to browse, and it will show all the chat rooms within that category. You can click on the little + symbol to expand if it is present.please add details what u exactly mean .. thank you .
The previous response is correct. Please select it as best answer.Go to view in the toolbar- text size - smaller or smallest. Or alternately hold down the control key and spin the wheel on your mouse away from you.
The first time you click on it it sorts from most answers to least... I believe it does this so that people can easily find the answers to questions that actually have them.. . If you click on the tab again it reverses this process... it starts with unanswered questions... so that people can see if there is something they can answer that hasn't been yet.. . The date organizer works the same way... it automatically gives you the most recent questions but if you click on it... the reverse happens and you can view questions that people have resubmitted/extended  (some on there are up to 2 months old... you'd probably never get to them by starting with most recent and clicking through)If you press it a second time it sorts the answers beginning with zero.
Under Yahoo Mail Options. there is a section called Block Addresss. Enter the id of the person you want to block.Mark it as spam.Click Options at the top right in Yahoo Mail > Select Mail on the left > then choose "Block Addresses" at the bottom of the left columnHey if it is yahoo go to mail options there u find a filter option.use it to block the senderWhen I did this I went into my buddy list and right clicked on the person screen name and then highlight block contact clicked on that, and it blocked the person I wanted to block.
my plain strategy is..i use my brain.. not wikipedia to answer a question. my motto is: i will answer to the best of my ability. many a times my answer gets picked as best one..i rely on my instincts and college smarts to answer..I don't care about the points & they'll just come flying in. And you probably thought I was going to say something different! You did, didn't you? Oh come on, you know you did! Maybe I should get off Y! Answers & go to bed. I feel that I'm lacking sleep....ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ...Answer as many as you canFind categories that you are knowledgeable about and really try to help the asker solve the problem. When you get selected as best answer, you not only get an additional 10 points, but you can get up to 50 more for thumbs up votes!I really don't care about the points, I just look around untell i find a question that i can help someone with.Give the best answer i can.I answered as many as I was limited to, and then voted & rated until my limit each day. Yeah, I need a life! I also tried to answer in careful and thoughtful ways MOST of the time so that perhaps I could be elected "best".answer,answer,answer. i max out possible points everynightStrategy... did not think that I really had one. I was in another part of my brain before I knew about the points. I needed to ask a question, and I guess I did not read everything.... hmmm... I guess it is just to answer as many questions as you can.
Why should it appear anyway?I DON'T KNOWPay more attention and explore all the options. Under the big Y on the toolbar (if that's what you're talking about, it's hard to tell from such a poorly worded vague question) you will see "Connect with Others" with an arrow next to it. That arrow means that another little menu will appear when you put your cursor there. The first thing on that little menu is 360You have to be a member of 360 and choose to let it show.  And Yahoo Answers isn't exactly the same as 360.

The leaderboard lists the top 5000. Currently that means you need 273 points to be on it.. Your rank is 1233 with 734 points (so there is a delay) 37 questions asked 251 answered!. :-)Yes, it is not updated everyday, but keep earning your points and you will get on there eventually... unless every one else earns a lot of points also.. .

To set Yahoo! as your default email program, you will first have to download and install the program that will be used to open up Y! Mail whenever necessary. You can find the instructions and download link at http://help.yahoo.com/help/us/mail/ext/ext-09.htmlGo to Tools --> Internet Options --> Programs.. . See the dropdown "Email", mine (IE v6) has three options Outlook, Outlook Express, and hotmail with no ability to add additional choices.  Don't you just love Microsoft?
*page views could include your friends + visitors (not friends). *visitors is just everyone who visits the page who isn't a friendI think page views shows you how many times that particular page has been accessed.. . Visitors shows how many unique visitors you have had. . You can see how this would be benificial, because if the same person looked at the page often or say. ..used it for a homepage.. it would throw off your results.
Signatures are normally at the bottom, that's why it's a siggy not a headline. I guess Yahoo figures you don't need to see it there everytime so they don't show it.Signatures are typically at the bottom of the email. Usually, the only thing displayed at the beginning of an email are the email headers.Thats what a Signiture is. It goes at the end of the Email (the Bottom).

Why can't we get points for asking questions that are dire to us and giving out answers that helps others? Why not, indeed?... It gives us something to look forward to, doesn't it?yep- I am just trying to get some more points todayTo balance the whole thing out...Because thats the way yahoo made this question/answer thingso u can get siked about answering questions and do nothing all day but sit behind the computer and do all day long and all night and repeat steps123 the next dayYou don't get points for asking question.. 2 point for answer question & 10 point for best answer.. That is the rule.
I linked my Yahoo! 360 page below. When you visit, there should be a link that asks you to create your own page. You can put a blog on there, photos, favorites lists and a few other things.It's like Myspaceits yahoo's version of myspaceyou can invite your friends to that.. and your friends can see your profiles and stuff also you can see your friends...it is the yahoo blog.  you can create a journal, post pictures, and control who can look at it.
Because they are no longer open questions. Some questions are resolved in which case you may rate the answer. While other questions are up for a vote in which case you can vote for the answer you like. You can only answer questions that are open.just like our life,it is very difficult to say that every body should be punctual and well desciplined. There is diversity in all the oders.
Start giving out points for best answers.  Once you are known as someone in the yahoo answers community that can be counted on to follow up, people will be there for you man!  Also..it's helpful to make sure your questions are concise, well-spoken, and spelled correctly.Hire a sky writer to write the link to your question in the sky with his plane, doing it over a big city helps too. Then, all the people that see it will just have to answer it right then! Or you could get an ad in the paper, that's always effective too.Ask easy or controversial questions.  Everyone has an opinion on politics.
DOUBLE CLICK ON THE PICTURE AND IT WILL TAKE YOU THEREAs far as I know the most you can view is just by clicking on their name under their avatar. There maybe another way to see more in depth but as far as I know there is no other way to view their profile.
Next to every answer there is small lettering that says, "report abuse".  You click on that and it walks you thru what to do.click "report abuse" under his or her name.From the Yahoo! Answers help pages:. . "If you discover objectionable content, you can report it to Yahoo! by clicking on the Report Abuse link next to the question, answer, or comment. You'll be asked to fill out a short form describing the problem. Customer Care will then take the appropriate action.. . Please note that the most common reasons for reporting abuse are:. .     * Adult/Obscene Content.     * Advertisement/Promotional Content.     * Copyright Infringement.     * Fraud/Negligence.     * Impersonation.     * Invasion of Privacy/Harassment.     * Not a Question or Answer.     * Profanity.     * Repeated Postings.     * Solicitation.     * Unreadable (rife with misspellings/bad grammar).     * Violence/Crime. . Please check the Yahoo! Answers Community Guidelines for complete content and usage terms."Well there is a report button under the question and your user and pic. Click and do what you got to do.I'm not sure.On every question there is a report abuse option. If Yahoo gets enough legitimate complaints they will bar the person that is causing the problem.There's a report abuse right under the the picture or   question and/or answer that person asked or answered.  Just click on it and it will tell you what to do.Pfff... I used once the "Report Abuse" for a clearly racist comment, but it had never changed anything!! I'm disapointed. Even more then once 1 of my question had been removed for the use of a "not english" sentence (but I didn't say anything bad).There is a Report Abuse button below the name when the question is available. . . Also, according to the rating system, people lose 2 points for asking questions, then they get shut off when they get down to zero.
i have fun and call my friendsI go to Yahoo! answers and type pointless questions in totally unrelated categories.Smile
If you have the Yahoo toolbar, it will give you a message icon when you recieve one. You have to look at it since there isn't any sound.  Often it's not an instant indicator.. . Or you can set up Messenger and it announces with sound and a pop up type message when one comes in.Isn't that silly? I don't think there's an option that lets you do that. If there was, Yahoo would notify you about new mail by sending you - notification mails. So imagine setting an option that lets Yahoo notify you about new mails. You open your inbox expecting 2 letters, but you only get one from your buddy (example) and the other saying: You got Mail from none other than... your buddy... =p
I do it mostly because I like to think that my answers might actually help... but yeah, there are times(like now) where I answer mostly just for the points.. . What good are these points anyways??I don't..er...I try NOT to...I mearly try to give an opinion or advice when asked...That would be lame to just answer to get points..but yeah there are many who do that..usually they're of no help and do not give any insight to the question.because its fun and its kinda like competeing like me and my friends all get on and see who can get the most points! right now im winning!!!!Sometimes the question is an easy 2 points and doesnt really need a serious answer...  Im not going to answer a breast cancer question, but if you ask why I answer for points, chances are you're gonna get a superficial answer..Hah, by answering this, the question becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy!. . I normally only answer questions where I feel I know the answer, or can at least give a useful answerI want to see what those special prizes are... gotta get to higher levels. :)I don't.. . Who cares about points?  What really makes me answer questions is the ability (I hope) to help someone.  Every now and then I may have to put in a silly answer to a silly question, but for the most part if I don't feel I have something positive to contribute and be worth reading, I won't answer.i do it cos it wod help ppl and not everything in life has to be done to win prizes and get money. a little pleasure can be derived frm helping ppl too.I answer for points so i can ask things myself.. most answers of me might be usefull...points whats that?
I suggest getting heat sensitive binoculars or something like that... maybe even ultraviolet.  Somethings gotta work.  If you can understand the technology then you will know its weaknesses.  Good luckOh yes, I lost my puppy that way. I put on the invisible spray and tried to take him to school, but I guess he got lost crossing the highway. One day he'll come back to me though. Oh, poor old blacky, I'll be waiting for you boy...I think I know what you mean. if you mean on AIM, then you just click on their info and see if it's available.. . if you mean actually invisible, then... well, refer to the other answers.Sorry, but, Invisible means : Invisible.That's what it's for. :)
The server may be down or busy,if your using a saved password,you might have cleared the cookie file and need to re-enter it. Try again later this is really common with yahoo messenger.becuz you're not connected to the internet
delete cookies history and cache. the stuff will still persist accessible to forensic tools. unless you wipe the drive and/or overwrite itwell if you run internet explorer try going to TOOLS then click INTERNET OPTIONS when you're there click the button that says clear history that's what i do
Are you using the latest version of Internet Explorer? The html editing tool used by Yahoo! Mail is not compatible with all browsers. However, you can get around this by switching to plain text mode as described in the link below.I have no idea, but I have a suggestion. Just log out and log back in, maybe it'll work!
your bulk mail folder IS for junk mail. just pretend it's not even there. asking how to stop spam is like asking how to stop the rain... you can spend a lot of time thinking about it but we're just not at the point where we can do anthing about now.If you find out let me know! I hate it to!

You don't. Thinderbird does not work with web based e-mail applications like Yahoo! It works with e-mails clients from Internet Service Providers like Earthlink, or Verizon or Comcast, etc.. any POP e-mailIt appears that the question period has expired. If you have received an answer that meets your needs, please choose one of those as a 'best answer.' If you haven't received a good answer for your question, you may want to consider the following,. . 1) Re-post your question. Newer questions get more activity on Yahoo! Answers than old ones.. 2) If you do re-post your question, consider why it wasn't answered the first time. Could it be more specific? Could it be worded better?

There maybe a virus that attacted your p.c. or probably there is an error on your browser...You should restart you p.c. If nothing's worked then you should make a new account to get a new i.d.!!!It may be losing the connection. If you are on a slower connection, try exiting other programs that use the Internet or download, such as LimeWire or Internet Explorer and see if the problem continues.It stops b'cuz it gets new clip or else ur internet connection speed might b slow-that could be the next reason..
go to address book.. choose the address and press deletesimply click on the link by source, it will tell all about it. also on that page, you'll see a link: account deletion, if you click that, it will bring you to the page were you delete your account... good luck.Go to the Yahoo account deletion page and login with your username and password. Then, to confirm once and for all that you want to delete everything associated with your login profile, enter your password again and click the button that says ‘Terminate this Account.’. . Your account is now gone.Delete it from Address book in Mail. or directly delete the person in Messenger.. Both have same effect.You really can't do it but if you stop using your email account for more than 30 days then it gets blocked and eventualy just stops working absolutely.
Yes, the point of Answers is to have a place to get answers to your questions. But to make Answers work, the most important thing is to have people to supply the answers. That is precisely what the points system was created for, although originally points were not deducted for asking questions because they needed to get some questions on here also.. . The points system is also a nice way for the asker to be able to see how useful the answerers have been to the community and will give some credibility to the answer.It takes too much time to think about that one.Those are the rules.  See them at the below link:The rulesyes, i agree, they have the layout of the point additions as well as deductions if you click on your total number of points it will take you to that page.  this is still relatively new and the points mean nothing as for right now.They want to encourage you to answer other questions as well as ask them, but don't get too frusterated about having to lose points to ask questions.  After your question has been posted for 24 hours, you can either chose the best answer, or put your answers to a vote.  Both of these actions earn you the two points back, so you really don't take any sort of hit.  You don't gain points by asking questions, but you don't really lose them in the end.  You still get the answers from others, so it works out for every one.  It's not hard to get to higher levels that let you ask more questions either.  Just comment and vote a lot, and give good answers to people will chose yours as the best and give you 10 points plus other people's rating points!  Have fun!so that in you dont just only accumulate knowledge by asking others but also share your lnowledge with others in return.they want you to give other people advice thats why
Up on this page, where you see "Hello <your name> | Points:... | Level: .." you click on your name and on the new page Edit Profile.

There you will have the option to edit any of your profiles and delete information you don't want other people to see.
If you're just referring to your instant messenging screen, you can do that by right-clicking on the picture currently in there.. .

Then click [edit] next to the profile you want to edit and there will be an option to edit it and add your picture.. . You are only able to add one picture to a conventional profile. If you want to use multiple pictures, you should consider starting a Yahoo! 360 page, which you can set as default by going to 360 Settings and choosing the second or third option under Yahoo! Display Identity.. http://360.yahoo.com/right click on a picture u want and send 2 ur pics. and when on messanger browse ur pics and bring it up.

u can also leave them an offline message by clicking on their names on ur messenger, open the box, type ur message ..click send and a note will appear to you saying that this contact of urs will receive the message the next time they log in to their yahoo messenger!they don't have to be online to send them an emailJust send them the e-mail.  It doesn't matter if they are online or offline.  When they get online, they'll be able to go to their inbox, open the e-mail, and read it.send an email whenever you want. whether they are on or not is irrelevent. . Haven't you ever send an email to someone who has AOL or Verizon, or Charter.net, or prodigy?   How would you know if they were on or not. That is the beauty of email, if you think of something to tell someone at 3 am, just do it, they'll see it when they next look at their IN BOX.

If you do then you will most likely not have to do that.it is for your protectionfor your protection so no spyware people can hack inyou don't have to if you change your settingsWell, it doesnt matter what computer you're on, it always asks you for your password and ID for your protection. However, you can check the box below the login box that says someting like "remember me" and it will always remember your password and ID to save you the trouble...I know, it annoys me too. Sometimes, you can check a box that says "Remember my username," which is helpful. I hope this helps!

You get the points back when you resolve the question.  The point is to encourage people to select a best answer or call a vote for their question.  Go ahead and ask all the questions you want, just be sure you pick a best answer in a couple of days!Used to be they gave 5 points for asking a question and people were asking a lot of really stupid questions just for the points.  Now it's a little better this way and has kept down the ridiculous ones.  The points don't matter for anything anyway. It's all free and this whole site is just in a test phase.you shouldn't ask questions if you like your points, questions penalize you -2 points.how should i know but u do get 2 points for anwseringbecause it keeps you helping other poeple out.I have nooooo clue?I think it is to discourage people from constantly clogging up the board with stupid questions like, "How are you?" and "What are you doing right now?"
There is now!  There's a small box next to the question itself which includes 'Email question' and either "Add to watch list' or 'Remove from watch list', depending on whether you've already added it or not.. . It IS sort of small!The button is right under the question that you have on your watch list.
You probably have the "Show Pictures" checkbox unchecked for your browser.  Go to "Tools", "Internet Options", "Advanced", scroll down to "Multimedia" and put a checkmark in the box for "Show Pictures".The red x's are pictures that didn't (or couldn't) download from the server (the source of the web page). . Sometimes clicking "Refresh" will cause them to load.  Sometimes if a server is very busy (with a lot of requests from a lot of users) it will lose the connection to you and the page will not complete loading.

If this doesn't meet your requirments I'd try reposting your question, it might get a little more play on it. . . Good Luck to you. P.s. You should pick this answer and not let it go to a vote.

What do you mean by pixels? The screen size? Your computer sends that information (screen size) along with the web address when it requests a web page. Yahoo! uses that screen size to determine which version of the page to send you.You may be referring to your screen resolution. It should be in the Display section of your Control Panel under the Settings tab
Sorry, Yahoo! Messenger does not offer this function, nor do I know of any other program that can incorporate spell check into it.There is no spellcheck in IM - you would have to use a program like MS-Word or WordPerfect to type the IMs and then transfer them to the IM window
It is in beta testing state and it is only for few users. They are going to improve it on their feedback. And gradually give it to all. It usually take about month.That link is for Yahoo! Events. Have you tried www.yahoo.com?
Find out where this person lives, go to their house, and drop an anvil on their head. It worked for Bugs Bunny.You might have to file a harassment complaint with your messaging service (I'm assuming it's Yahoo).
First of all, you have to believe in yourself despite what other people think.  Secondly, confidence can be built up with constant practice but it will only be effective if you've accomplished no. 1. Thirdly, assess yourself constantly against community standards and improve deficiencies.why not? look your best in a simple way, wear simple clean clothes, keep yourself clean, brush your teeth and flash that smile, chin up while walking..if you want some style let's say look for a magazine and look for whatever suits your body and your age (be simple). make friends..you were made by God, before you were born He knew you, you are fearfully and wonderfully made. dont let the poeple around you change you, you are His, and He loves more than the most loving father on earth to the milioin millionth power ever could. you are covered with the fingerprints of God and are truly loved by Him.
From your main Messenger window, click "Messenger" up on the top of the window, then read down and click "Preferences". Click "Archive" in the list on the left, and you will have access to the settings.

I looked at your profile, and it does say you are 18. However, the page you saw may just have been a notice that it was an adult profile.

In the upper right corner of their 360 page is where the pictures are located. Just click on them to see more.U mean on this site? Click on their photo. Or regular mail. I think u still click on their photo, or if they have a link, click on that.
You don't. Yahoo customer service is really only for serious security issues like hacking, or for people who pay them for services. Anything free gets little to no support, period.No way. They don't do that.
I totally agree with you!. Some people ask questions,get a thousand answers,and instead of picking the right answer,they simply let the question expire,or just keep asking more questions,to a point where the questions they ask don't make sense. Just like you,I only answer questions,I fell are serious,besides,why would anyone want to know,what a person's favorite flavor of Jello is?That's why we've changed the point system to "charge" users 2 points whenever they ask a question, and making it possible to recover those points only if they pick a Best Answer (or open it up for a vote).  Every time a user blows off his question in the way that you describe, mcds11211, he throws away 2 points.  It no longer pays to do that--it's just sloppy.Well, some people just want an answer. It is up to them to award points or not. And even if you do not recieve points for answering, you did a good thing. You helped someone out.I think we can always at least try. If our cries fall on deaf ears, there's still the one in a hundred chance that they'll be better off in their lives. I just started doing this, and I'm going to try my best to answer everything I can, and I hope over time the reputation system will improve so that the only questions will be serious questions, and the only answers will be serious answers.Perhaps they don't understand the system, or they are only trying out Answers to see what its like but don't come back.I think its funI answer questions not for the thumbs up or the points, but because I feel that maybe I might help someone. If they don't like my advice they don't have to take it. However, if I help one person, I feel good about myself and that is worth more than the thumbs up or even the two points.isnt this all for fun anyways,for us bored people...doesn't really matter we gave them the answer if they don't check that's their problem not ares.at least we have 2 points.It seems there are many who don't bother to find out how this works. They don't know the process and it is my suggestion that the opening page to Answers be a simple "how to" with an agreement option. After a member has been active for a predetermined amount of time, if they do not comply to the agreement, an email outlining the "how to" gets sent and then if they do not comply, they get suspended until their questions fit the compliance. . . But then again, I am a die hard! LOLi try to help others, cuz ppl also helped me when i had questions . its a nice place to ask questions that u might not want to ask other ppl that know udo you want a cookie or a cracker as long as you help someone out that is what matters yes its nice to vote on the best answer but you shouldnt expect to be rewarded
Is it an error 999? On Yahoo! that means you've temporarily exceeded your bandwidth, maybe sending files to your friends.

Whoever reported you to Yahoo should have reported you to me instead.. . It's evident you need a little discipline - and I'm rightly equipped to administer it.maybe somebody was envy of your attractive avatar..or someone didnt fully read any details that came with your question-and misjudged what you were askingpeople are strange ,when you're a stranger. faces look ulgy ,when you're alone.. people seem wicked .when you're unwanted. streets are uneven .when you're down. -jim morrisonBecause the want you to make them need stitches!Well I have to agree, you are a nice girl. You picked my response as best answer! Just wanted to say thanks.. . I guess I could answer your question while I'm here :0). . Maybe it was in err. I've been reported before (there's a surprise) and I noticed that it occurred when someone else was reported on a question of mine. I guess it was like one of those situations where they take both parties involved. I wouldn't take it personal but you shouldn't let it go either. There's a link @ the bottom of the e-mail where you can dispute it.. . aye,aye,yo! shake my foundations!. I agree with the person earlier; if that's really you in the avatar you're pretty friggin hot. Maybe that's it. A jealous stick in the mud reported you. They're a dime a dozen. Sorry it happened.. .

There is software to help create passwords that are really tough to break, or you can look at any of the on-line articles on creating a good password.. . One admin I knew kept a chart about 10x10 with a different character in each cell. She had a plan (which she did not divulge) for finding a row of characters to use for this month's password and could actually generate multiple passwords for different systems off the chart. She could keep the chart nearby and just glance at it to remember an old password or make a new one.Here's a trick to choosing a password that is virtually unbreakable and at the same time easy to remember. Think of a short word that is easy for you to remember. Then think of a number that is also easy to remember. Then combine the two, alternating letter and number. For example:. Word = John. Number = 123. Password = J1o2h3n. . It's good to throw a capital letter in the mix, or even punctuation. If you use the same password for many different things, you'll need to limit the length and content, since not all passwords allow punctuation, some limit the length to 10 characters, etc.Did you have a stuffed animal that you nicknamed but never told any of your friends about? Was there a girl you had a secret crush on in middle school and never confessed to anyone? You could use her name plus the year you were in school for her. Think of some random facts about your past that you never told anyone about but something you can remember easily. Good luck!IF YOU'RE REFERRING TO YAHOO--WELL ALMOST ANYONE CLOSE TO YOU CAN CLICK-ON AND SAY THEY FORGOT THE PASSWORD. IT'S THE SECURITY QUESTION AND SECRET ANSWER THAT YOU'VE CHOSEN THAT COULD ULTIMATELY PROVE TO BE THE CRUX OF THE MATTER--CONSIDER THIS:--MY SOON TO BE "EX" WOULD OFTEN TIME ACCESS MY ACCOUNT BECAUSE OF INFO TO WHICH WE BOTH WERE PRIVY--FOR INSTANCE:--FAVORITE PET'S NAME--MOTHER'S MAIDEN NAME; ETC. HOWEVER, THE QUESTION--WHAT SCHOOL DID I ATTEND--ALTHOUGH, SHE WAS WELL AWARE OF THE NAMES OF THE SCHOOLS AND UNIVERSITIES THAT I ATTENDED I SIMPLY ANSWERED THE QUESTION WITH--"DEDE'S HOUSE OF PAIN"--SHE NEVER FIGURED IT OUT!--OR HOW ABOUT YOUR FAVORITE VACATION SPOT--ANSWER SOMETHING LIKE--"PORCHVILLE"--JUST BE CREATIVE
when you appear offline, you can still be seen online on your profile, in your address book and in yahoo mail if you have sent messages. If you change it to permanently offline it means you will never be shown online to those specific people.the difference is that permanently offline means that u dont have to keep putting urself offline to that one person u "block"appearing offline means you're invisible.  with permanently offline, that person would always see you offline even if your status is actually "available" or any other status.Cuz wen u appear offline then ppl can tell that ur invis 2 them cuz u can hav the little light on in ur address book but wen ur permanently offline then ppl think ur siriously offline!

Answers will be able to help you since we have also used the Yahoo! services.Do you just want it reported, or do you actually want someone to do something about it? If you just want to report the problem and never have it solved, I would recommend sending them an email or contacting their technical support ;)

To start off, call police, and I would like to know exactly "how" someone would stalk you online. What do you mean by that, because noone can follow you online unless they are a really good hacker, or a virus is on your computer, but even so, doing that just to "stalk you", I really don't see how stalking could be possible unless through some type of instant messenger, but you can block that out, or maybe through some person web space thing like myspace. If it is something like myspace, you might want to contact myspace and tell them what is going on, tell them about the situation, ask them to point you to the proper authorities for matters like this. Hope this helps.Contact the police, file a report, this is serious.
you have settings to adjust are what you looking for is to adjust each indivual blog entry? i find setting it on friends only gives me enough protection from wondering eyesI Agree woth you... They are letting peolpe to view this as an example i hope..Yeah, I agree with you, they should. I don't know why they don't. Maybe they just like to have random people looking at blogs. I think the catagory (i forgot how to spell it) idea is great because then you could put people on that list, and they can read it. Anyway, maybe they might get an idea from reading this.No Answer. But I too Agree with you. The thing i miss on Y 360 and the reason why i did not continue using it is that Categorising the Blog Entries is not Possible as to who will be able to see it.
Sorry, you can't change your birthdate, but you can change your security key. Just click where it says [My Account] at the top of each page and click the link to change your security key.You don't. There is no option to change it. It doesn't show up anywhere for anyone to see, not even for you.

More details are required for an answer.You need to say this better. I have no idea what you are asking about.
It is where they ask for your password.It is a security measure. If you were to be online and walk away from the computer to get a drink or go to the bathroom, someone could sit down, click right to your account information, change your password and steal your account before you got back. The Password prompt asks for your password to make sure that you, the actual account owner, are the one trying to access that private information.
There should also be a button that says 'Show Headers' under the message to the right.In your inbox, go to options (upper right corner) and click on general preferences. On the messages section, click on show all headers on incoming messages.
Just dont ever use the other one.  I believe it takes like 6 months of no activity for it to be automatically deleted.First you will have to cancel any paid services you have with Yahoo! Take down any personals accounts and close your 360 page if you have one. If you have no public information left on your Yahoo! account, read the full details about closing your account at the link below and then close your account by clicking on the link provided there. Please note that you will not be able to get back any information (address book, etc.) that was in that account.
You could always set that one person to see you as invisible. Right-click their name and hit the steath settings. You can appear invisible to them, but everyone else sees you as on.click on the person once on your messenger, then right click for the person you want to appear invisible to... click stealth modeselect the person name in your list and right click and the name and goto stealth setting and select online , Soo will be visible to only that person and be invisible to others; you can use this setting for more than one person, and you can even select invisble always to a person so if you are visible to allothers you can still be invisible to that person
Open your Yahoo! Mail.. Click on Options in the upper right corner.. Under Management, click on Mail Addresses.. Highlight your email address and click Edit.. Delete the email listed in the Reply To box.The way email is designed is that you can seperate the from address and the reply-to address.  I don't know what client you're using to send emails but hotmail, yahoo, outlook, etc. all have options within their settings that let you specify a different reply-to address.  You should be able to disable this if you want to use the same email or change the email, etc.

You can't. To the best of my knowledge, third party e-mail clients like Outlook Express can only be used with POP based e-mail accounts, like most Internet Service Providers give their customers.

Highlight the text you wanted to make smaller then click on the Font Size icon. It's represented with 2 A's and a bidirectional arrow at the bottom.

Or go to View in the toolbar- text size and choose the one you want.

yahoo DIRECTORY. but you won't find my profile there for some strange reasonNot everyone uses their yahoo ID for messenger and email. For instance this name Im using is only for my email, I use another ID for messenger and profile information. You can search: profiles.yahoo.com/ and put in any ID after the "/".
Since you weren't thoughtful enough to include ANY details at all, we have no idea. Try asking the same questions at Yahoo! Psychics. Or, delete this vague question and re-ask it as a new one this time providing details like: what happens when you try, any error messages that appear, Messenger reaction when you click to log in, etc..well i had problems w/ it to but what i done was went back to it and redownloaded it again and it started working for me at that time..so try to download it again and see if it will work, if not i am not sure what the problem could be..
They only update the leader board once a week. I think it is early monday morning.Yup.  The leaderboard is not in "Real" time.  You will notice all the data is different.. . The leaderboard is updated every Monday, so the info is where the person was then.Thanks to everyone for their answers--especially MsKnowItAll and meanie, who've combined for the right answer.Yahoo answers is Beta version now.. There are many bugs present.. Like sometimes number of answers are not displayed correct in question list etc.. They are on the process of correcting itThe leaderboard is updated every Monday. It doesn't care if you've gained more points since then.

Get your Yahoo mail to display a 100 mails in one page. This can be done by the Options page - you'll get that by clicking on the arrow next to Mail on the main page of your Yahoo mail. Once you get the 100 mails per page, click on "Select all" on the page and then Delete.hold down the shift key and highlight the ones you want to delete, press delete, and ....pooof.... they're gone.
You lose points when you ask questions. This is to encourage you to answer questions rather than ask any questions.. . Answer more questions.:)Answer questions, don't ask.  They want you to help others out instead of just getting help.  You must give knowledge in exchange for it.  That's why.  Another hint:  Don't ask questions!  I haven't, and I'll be at 158 after this answer . . .You only lose 2 points if you never choose a best answer or call a voteanswer questions, rate best answers and vote for best answers more than you ask questions. pretty soon, you will have a lot of points if you do that everyday.It's all about "checks and balances". with questions, you are asking for something. with answers you are giving something. Seems logical eh?
give it to people!Maybe you have the emails joined. I have SBC and I have 2 accounts, and receive email in just one box.The second address is probably just a profile.. You can't send emails to a profile just your yahoo mail name. To check if it is a profile when you sign in to your email on the top left corner it says my account.. click that.. re-enter your password.then on the right side it says edit/create profiles..cliock that it will say if you have profiles through that name and which is your email address.
Go to my yahoo page click on add content. Choose Add RSS by URL  First make sure your Y360 has is url active ( go to 360 page click on settings scroll down to do this) save it and wait for awhile go back to add content by url insert and save. Good lucki think that you should go to yahoo homepage and chek it out
You can just sign up for it, search it through Yahoo Mail, and apply, BUT I don't think they are giving it to everybody just yet. I know for a fact that they gave it to selected memebers as free download pop up, I was one of the first ones who got it couple of months ago, at that time they were just doing it on trial bases, to get feedbacks but I think by now if you just apply for it they should be able to send it to you.first you need to submit your email in the yahoo beta then they will email you after a couple weeks later with your  yahoo beta.
Unfortunately, the leader board is only updated once a week, so it is rarely up to date. Also, especially when you are in level 1 or 2, it takes forever to find your name. I think Yahoo Answers definitely needs a search feature to find your own name AND a leaderboard that constantly updates itself. It doesn't seem like this would be so difficult, just a simple programming issue, but what do I know?Congrats to everybody for getting this right! We update the Leaderboard once a week. So if your name doesn't appear check back on Monday.The board is updated once a week. So, most likely you had less points when the snapshot was taken. Look in the next few pages. You will find yourself.i don't know. that's odd.The leaderboard is updated every Monday. Check back then for the most recent scores.I am not on there either.  I am at the upper level of level 2 and have checked several times.  I am coming to the conclusion that you just can't see yourself on there??????
Your Yahoo! Toolbar will only display a bell-shaped icon as an alert when you receive a mail message. To hear a sound when you get incoming mail, you will have to use Yahoo! Messenger.yahoo does not give new mail notification like aol.. sure it does permit it under yahoo messenger. . for that log in to yahoo messenter and then lick on file->preferences->sounds
Click on your name next to where it says Hello at the top. Then go to "edit my info" next to your profile. There are three choices you can pick. Pick avatars and your picture will come up instead of your grey smiley face.I see you did it by now... Pick the one above as best  :)
The Answers Forum is set for a particular time zone, and all times are relative to that zone.  Thanks for responding, folks.It is set by San Fransico time where the Y! Answers Team resides. I know! It's really weird.It is probably a glitch in the particular web site you are posting to.  If it offers profile options, it may have an option on what time zone you are in.
easy. just highlight everything you don't want to forward, and hit the "delete" buttonCopy it-clean it up-send it.I dont think it's possible. When you forward, everyone will see who has received it. Best bet, even though it's annoying, send seperate emails.forward as inline text not attachment. It will allow you to edit the forward and then you can just delete them.it is possible...when you forward, you can edit the text in the email that was sent to you.  just highlight addresses etc and delete them...you can highlight all of them, and hold down the ctrl key and press x which will cut them and then go to BCC (Blind Carbon Copy) and do ctrl v to paste them.cut the email excluding the forwarder address, compose an email, paste what you cut; then send. Now cheer me up with 2 points :")click on forward button and select forward as inline attachment-that will allow you to see the thread and you can edit the email you like to forwardput the ones you dont want the other to see under BCC (blind carbon copy)I believe that this is where the BCC option comes in.  I am not 100%, but I know that I was advised that if I BCC folks instead of CC-ing them when sending out an original message, that prevents them from seeing the whole list of names it's going to.  Good luck!cut and copy bud!! be sure to give credit where it is deserved though!!When you open the email, copy it's contents with the exception of the addresses, then post it into a new email.....,Send away!
Just click on the little arrow beside the yahoo icon up top. and go down to games and you'll see it.go to http://games.yahoo.com. . and pick the one you want to play.  They have a lot of fun games for one person, or against others.  And it's free - thank you Yahoo!go to yahoo messenger and u can play with the one and also chat with him at the same time. i tried it its great
To change this, log into your Yahoo! E-mail, click the "Options" link near top right corner of the page then click "General Preferences". Delete your name from the box after "From Name" and replace it with whatever you'd like. Click on "Save", and your problem will be solved.Sarcastiks the Man, Pick his and get it over with.

That seems to be a major flaw of Yahoo answers. . . There are probably people with a much higher score than me who haven't provided a single useful or insightful answer to any question.You should just ignore these kind of questions, answers, or comments. Yeah, do your best to be a good member and try not to let problem members ruin your own experience. This works for me. Good luck.Sometimes it is just to lighten things up a bit.  As long as the remark is not degrading, I think an occasional rib is ok, especially if the question itself is stupid.. . I try to answer the serious ones as best I can though.Some times its winning, not the prize that matters...oH, SO IT's the stupid ANSWERS that get U 2 POIntS?. . HoW mUch Do yOU get 4 sTupid QuesTionS?. . PoiNts foR EverYBOdy!!!. . WHatS tHe ValuE oF a PoiNt AnyWaY?  . Is THeRe a wiNNer?. . SERIOUSLY...  It's amazing how such an useless question as this one attracted so many serious people with such 'big' answers, when questions like 'Can Chickens Fly?' brought on much more humor.  I find Yahoo Answers very interesting because it tends to bring out the real person in us all.I never answer questions in a stupid way or to get points.  I answer questions to learn more...when composing an answer I am forced to think clearly and coherently.  Learning is its own reward.. . Check my account...I have not asked any questions yet...I learn much from answers other people give too.I think if they say someting actually stupid or rude it is because they are immature and unkind. But sometimes people are trying to be funny, hopefully not at someone elses expense.  If they are mean just ignore them and remember their name so you can ignore their answers in the future.  And remember their is no such thing as a stupid question--unless you are actually trying to ask a stupid question to see the reaction you get from people. :-)  Hope this helps.
You can find out all about getting points by clicking on the link below. The rewards system won't be fully worked out until Answers comes out of beta-testing, but you still get recognition when people look at your point level in your profile.Click on the Q&A button below the ASK button in your screen.. In the top of the right long rectangle where it says "Tell me more" click there and you will get all the info you need.for me nothing, I want to helpI don't think they really "mean" anything...it is really just a goal to get the most points. Like a contest, to see how long it takes you to climb the Level chart and who can pick your answers to the the BEST.

Yep, sometimes they will still show up if they are signed in to certain other services on Yahoo! However, it's also possible that they're just closing the Messenger program without signing off first.Are you sure they are really signing out? .    Maybe they are playing in Yahoo Games after they sign out, for some odd reason if you are in a Yahoo Games room without being signed into Messenger, you will show as online in Messenger.
To get rid of it from your browser, right-click on the toolbar, and a pop-up menu will appear.  Then un-check the yahoo toolbar option, and it will go away.

The only way you will know is if they accept the invitation, at which point they will be deleted from your buddy list. If they don't accept you will receive no notification.. .

You don't "lost" (or even lose) points for asking a question; you spend them.  When you select the best answer, you get your points back.  It encourages askers to select a best answer, and also to search to see if their question has been asked before.. (You didn't search, or you would have seen that your question has already been asked - many, many, many times.)beacuse if you give an answer for any question , there are efforts and knowledge. information isthe expensive thing in the world in all areas. the decareasing points is the fee for your question and knowledge lackness

That sounds like the problem. Check your power settings.my laptop sometimes turns off the modem to save power. the interruption in internet service signs me out of yahoo. check your power settings to see if it's set up to turn off the modem at any point.
There is nothing you can do directly - if your ID has been stolen, then it's now fully "owned" by the other guy.. . BUT.... you can/should report this to Yahoo... and eventually, if you're patient, persistent, and polite - AND assuming you know your original account details (date of birth, email address, secret question/answer, etc) they may be convinced you ARE the rightful owner, and return the account to you.You should tell all your acquaintances to ignore that Yahoo!ID and provide them with your new one. Is it simpler than deleting an account?

Depends on which email you are using. MSN and Yahoo have this facilityIf they are e-mails from companies that you subscribed to at one time, they are required to have a link somewhere in the e-mail to unsubscribe from the mailing list. If they aren't, perhaps you could set up a "junk e-mail address" where you use that to sign up for online services that post your e-mail address and generate these junk e-mails, as well as using an e-mail provider like Yahoo that has Spam filtering.If you are using yahoo, hotmail, of gmail, thenn you can just check the box next to the e-mail and put them in junk or spam. Then, whenever that person e-mails you, they e-mail will go straight to your 'junk' folder.
I think Yahoo messed up because it is "Richard" and he has. 29,981 points! On his Q&A page it says he is level 7!  I think Yahoo has a bug in their system!He didn't return to the seventh level of hell, did he?

I don't know why.  I've thought about this issue before, however and imagine that it's only because Yahoo Answers is still quite new and in it's Beta testing phase.  I was kind of hoping that once they get it all perfected and set for an Alpha phase, that users could select their own color scheme, or um...  once a user logged in, the site would use whatever color scheme/themes that particular user was using on MyYahoo, or in Yahoo Mail.It's a fresh, springtime product. Yahoo! Answers is still in the beta-testing phase of its youth so I think it's appropriate. I like it.A lot of web sites use green because it's a 'user friendly' and inviting color. It's supposed to attract more users. I've been in the web industry for 10 years and have read such studies on color theory before.. . You also have to consider that maybe tha Yahoo! Answers team just likes green.Because green is green!
You either don't, or you send an Abuse report. . Make it the other person's problem and not yours.There's a "not an answer" category for reporting abuse.file an abuse report! that'll scare 'em straight..and she should have really took the time to read details attached to the question-so as to better understand what is it you are trying to ask the community-if i'm wrong about my viewpoint-then my bad!contribute to relevant ones. Help others by sharing your knowledge. There are always two sides to a coin. Dont be worried about the other side.
Yes, it's called the Report Abuse button. Why bother making noise if your only gonna lose some or all your points? Most of the noise makers will eventually give up.if there where something that could decipher relevance they'd be rich. In fact google is rich.dont knowWhat noise?
Do you have Yahoo Voice? I guess so. Anyway, what you do is when you are in the chat window click Conference in the upper right hand corner.no i dont think so i have messenger myself

You don't get anything for the points, but it does bring out the competitive spirit in people.. . Now if only we could get them to try earning those points by providing well thought out, solid answers.Because we are addicted to points! 618 and counting...2 more points worth zero dollars...pricelessBecause some of these people are only interested in their rating, and how high up on the list they are. Pity!O-mi-God, so you mean to tell me I've been a wastin' my time here fer nuttin'!Dosen't matter, I want the points. HAWHAT!?!?hi.Ya mean like this??Probably cause they're too stupid to answer a real question.i know what's up with that people just don't get it. I like no I love giving advice!!! I don't care about getting points.cause we can do thatBecause I am am a "point whore thats needs points to live". p.s. If there is any way you can transfer any of your points into my "point account" I would greatly appreciate it..  thanks..
You cannot remove questions from the "My Answers" section. It lists all of your answers.. . However, if the question is still open to be answered, you will still be able to go to the question and either edit or delete your response.MINE have not been automatically removed after being resolved so I also will  be watching for the correct answer
Because some (like you and me) will read them. And when Y!A kicks someone out they can tell them why it is a violation of the Community Guidelines.. . I do think people should have to take a test (much like at iStockPhoto), but only after they have gotten in trouble for posting something that got reported. If they make the sign-up process to hard less people would join Y!A.it's a legal cover your a** technique.  read the small print.
Because the Yahoo! censors weren't careful enough when they designed it to filter words like a-s-s."Assist."  Whoops...that would be a bug!  Thanks for letting us know.You used it in the top question alright so maybe all you have do is use  capital letters and you'll be ok.Yahoo would just be picking up on the first 3 letters, thus putting the stars in it's place as the word would be recognised as a swear word.Because of the 1st 3 letters in it. You are not allowed offencive words but the prog doesn't know that its not an offencive word and rejects it. Same thing happened when I tried to tell someone finish - it and the word was not accepted even though a space was there between the words!!cause it has the other word for booty/daisy/behind in it.  a s swell the 1st three letters make up something isnt it? Yahoo filters have some glitches and it is one of them.
Right click on a link and select "Open in New Window".. . I dont't think you can set this through Yahoo, so you must do it through your browser settings.Hold the command key while clicking on a Mac.

In 1994, Stanford Ph.D candidates Jerry Yang and David Filo began indexing interesting Web sites as a hobby. "Jerry and David's Guide to the World Wide Web" turned into Yahoo!, meaning "Yet Another Hierarchical Officious Oracle!" A very successful IPO followed in 1996, and within a few years, Yahoo! became a major global brand with offices around the worldIt was founded by Stanford graduate students David Filo and Jerry Yang in January 1994 and incorporated on March 2, 1995. The company is headquartered in Sunnyvale, California.
Go to the yahoo answers HOME screen and scroll all the way down to the green header that says "Pick the best answer. Vote on undecided questions." You can vote on all the questions that are listed under that header and there are more when you click on "More Undecided Questions >" at the VERY end of the page.i don't think you can... do u mean to vote on questions that have alrdy been voted for? then i don't think u can... :(
This 3 seconds or so are the time since the question has been closed.It can only be closed 24 hours after being asked.. Welcome here!The previous three responses form the answer.  There's nothing to add.  Our job is getting easy!with the new yahoo rules... questions can be resolved only after 24 hours.. questions r quikly resolved wen the asker has got wat he wanted and is not waiting for any more answers.i believe it's how long since it was resolved...you can go back and check the times the answers came in if you're curious, that will help you figure it out.If it has a lot of answers the asker can close the question.
Near the top of your "MyYahoo! homepage you will find three categories to select. They are "add content", "change layout" & "change colors". Click on these and you can pretty well customize your home page any way you want.login and use the CHANGE LAYOUT option on mypage.
mine's exactly the same, always worked fine till a couple weeks ago. I also added the photo module and it says the same thing. At least the "error loading toolbar buttons" went away.I dont know, but if it bothers you, ask a yahoo client personally or get help from your computer or internet server.Same problem here -- but only with one of my two Yahoo accounts!  Tech support from Yahoo says they are aware of problem, but to date no fix.  I've tried it w/ Internet explorer, Netscape 7.2 and Netscape 8.1, so its not the broswer.  Also -- it ain't the cache -- I've emptied them all....
You must wait the exact time. Hour, minute, second.No. You can't fix this. Everyone has to follow the rules at Y!    Answers & waiting 24 hours is one of them.You have to wait the exact time.It has to be the exact to the dot 24 hours. I know it sucks I'll go and it says its been 24 hours but yet it still wont ylet you. grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr It makes me sooooo mad. glad to know that I am not the only one bothered by this!You can't do anything about it because the compter has to give people a chance to give people their answers.I think it should be more like 3 hours before you can pick the best aswer than 24 hours.Well, you probably waiting for my answer.  Okay, try it now, click me.

Not for asking a question. They do this to discourage people from asking only dumb questions like what is 1+1 and just stuff that is dumb.As has been pointed out, you get those two points right back as soon as you choose a Best Answer, or put the question to a vote.  That's designed to make sure that you _do_ resolve the question.. . Back before we "charged" points to ask a question, we had a problem with people pumping out a lot of meaningless questions in order to rack up points.  They had no intention of resolving the questions, so the questions just hung around and cluttered up the system.  Now, you have to tend your question.  Moreover, since the entire question-asking process is point-neutral, the only reason to ask a question is--get this--really wanting to know the answer! :-). . Hope this explains it, Ashley!*sighs*I believe this rule is an important rule, in order to have some control on the amount of question posted, i have noticed that sometimes there is a lack of answers for some questions, and there is a lack of votes for some questions in voting. . So, in this way, this game - as i call it - forces us to try to answer more that we make questions.your not helping anyone or finding out anything your basically doing for yourselfIn order to keep people awnsering questions you have to awnser them; therefor it cost points to ask
Regarding the first problem, questions can be removed in two ways, if there's an abuse report (not sure how carefully they're looked at, to be honest), or if the asker chooses to delete the question.. . As to your second question, it's unforturnately the same for me. However, most of the questions (those that have 2+ responses) end up going to a vote, although some of them get stuck in tiebreaker mode forever.. . One thing we could do is after a certain amount of time (let's say, two weeks), any questions with less than two answers, and any in tiebreaker mode, would be "recycled" and re-displayed on the front page.Read these answers together, and you've got one that's as good as anything we can provide.  Thanks, folks.The people that don't pick a best question or put it up for a vote I'm guessing are not that serious about the question or they just plain forget about them.  A lot of times they are removed for silly reasons, someone complained when my husband posted a question about a movie and it was removed becuase it was "not knowledgeable"!!!!1. If there is an inappropriate post, you can report it.  If Yahoo higer powers agree, they will remove it.  . 2. As for picking a correct answer, sometimes all the answers are wrong or lame, so it is hard to choose a best when one doesn't have their answer yet.. 3. Another answer--laziness, or loss of interest.. 4. Sometimes you get your answer, but it is too soon to choose a best, then by the time it is time, you forgot about it.
You can't delete a status message. But, you can create enough new ones so that the one you don't want will not show on the menu.I had trouble with this too. The only thing you can do is just keep making new ones and as you do, the old ones will automatically be deleted."Please Note: Yahoo! Messenger will save the last 5 status messages you have entered. Currently, there is no way to delete these status messages.". . So you need to create more than 5 custom messages.how to remove new status message from  yahoo messenger

But thanks for the points dude!Ummm..... Presss the backspace???backspaceI've seen this question asked several times.  You kids need to quit searching for things you don't want your parents to see.  :P  Even if you delete it from the search box, they can still find out what you're doing in the history.
You don't lose 2 points. You get them back when you choose a best answer or put the question up for a vote. It is done to discourage peole from asking stupid questions and then leaving them unresolved.The QueenofSummertime and MJ23_4life each have the right answer.  Thanks, you two, as well as to everyone else who contributed.Well, look at it this way; we gain them back if we pick the best answer.  It can't all be all getting; you have to give a little to get a little.consider it the price of a good answerFor no other reason than to try to decrease ridiculous questions. And because yahoo has a magnifying glass...Education cost!I don't know, but try not to ask as many questions.asking is taking, answering is giving.unfortuantly that's how life is..we do something and we mostly get punished for it! life is just cruel sometimes!Because its like that! Idk why, but stiill, i no there is a reason!-_-dunno but you just lost 2 points i just gained two points lolI don't know, but thanks for the pointsat least you can ask questions ive been trying and cantthey do it to encourage more answers and less questions.  otherwise there would be a huge number of questions vs relatively few answers. they feel that this way the questions that do get asked will get several answers and help keep this site what its supposed to be...informative.it isnt a punishment, just a sort of costBut then, we're rewarded 2 points for answering a question, and one point for either voting for a Best Answer or giving the Best Answer a thumbs up or thumbs down.
Because they think they know everything.  And they believe you've never delt with the things they deal with.because they want to make there own choices and they think they know everything i did lol why are you a teenagerWhen little children become teens, they think that they have accomplished another important stage in their life.  This is the point when they believe they can drink, smoke, have sex, go out to parties every weekend, get in the house late (no curfews), etc.  They believe that they have become adults and think that they are ready to make their own decisions.  The best advice for a parent in this type of situation is to let them (the children) have it their way; once they need the parent, they will find themselves running back to their parents for help and realize that life should not go so fast. (by the way, i am a teen myself. i am turning 17 this year; i happen to have really strict parents and i am a very understanding daughter. i am not one of these teens, although i have felt these feelings before)Kids are there to press the limits and the parents are to blame for half of the stuff that they do when they get older. They have already known what they can get away with. And sometimes the emotional feelings within the family between the teens and family shows greatly in their behavior.because teens feel that parent simple don't understand the way things work nowadaysBecause if you think about it do any of us still today listen to our parents? I rather get advice from my friends than my parents. I don't we want to hear the awful thruth from our parent sometimes
War heroes, who faced death, wanted to create children fast, both to live after them, and in case of another war. Usually men are reluctant to start families because of the cost, but their patriotic spirit was too strong!BlackoutsThe cause of the baby boom was men coming home from World War II and making up for lost time.hother13 is right.  It had nothing, NOTHING to do with pent up sexual desire.  That is the way people who don't read much history attempt to explain it.  In reality, the economy did not dip after WW II, thanks to Harry S Truman's post-war economic programs and returning GIs were able to afford to have one or possibly two more children.  Most families only increased by ONE or maybe TWO babies, but with 30 million families that added up quickly.  The Baby boom burned out by 1962 and family sizes settled at around 3.3 children each set of parents.It was actually the late 1940's. The men had been away at war and the women were at home working and saving their money. When the men came home there was enough saved up to buy their own house and life was pretty comfortable for everyone for the most part. Most women went back to not having a job when the men came home and were able to raise the kids.

It all depends on the state. You can be charged as an adult for some crimes, you can drive, you can get married (with parental permission), and you can legally have sex. Also, in Germany, you can drink!IN MANY STATES YOU CAN DECIDE WHO YOU WISH TO HAVE SEX WITH. IT IS AT THIS AGE THAT YOU CAN DO THIS WITHOUT LEGAL CONSEQUENCES. OF COURSE THERE IS THE (MUTUAL AGREEMENT) FACT.No new rights.  You have the right to a free public education, to not be abused, to be fed, clothed, and sheltered.  You may be able to get a driver's license in some states, and a job in some counties.What ever your parents give you.. But.... . You can file for emancipation in some states, to get married for instance.No new rights. Some legal privaleges may be granted such as getting a drivers license or a job.

If you are in an IM, there is a red sign you can click on (is at the right on top of the conversation window) to ignore the user if he is not on your contact list.. If the person is on your contact list, you can ignore him by going in Contact -> Contact Options and choosing Ignore User.
Buzz him. If he is your frined and he's online, he will reply.The nice thing about Yahoo Messanger, is that you can send offline messages. What I usually do, is send a message to the person.

You already have a Yahoo! ID. All you have to do is download the program from http://messenger.yahoo.com/ and then install it.

It Sucks......Usually Coz Of Scripts n Windows Error.. Check Ur Version.your messenger files might be corrupt. try removing it by going to start/control panel/ add/remove programs. then once removed reinstall it directly from the yahoo site. if that isnt the case you might be behind a firewall or using a router.
Or beard!  Or gray hair!  For that matter, there are no old guys at all!  What's an old guy to do?I have asked myself the same thing.... probably because the avatars are relatively new and,with time, yahoo will add clothing,hairstyles and mustaches
trust me, you dont want to. It really blows.click the link below
I think they may be doing work on it in certain areas.... Give it time.... I am seeing partial pics show up.... I responded to a question and my answer didn't show up.... So it's not just you...Define "weird"...
A question is up for voting for a week. If at the end of that time, there are no votes or there is a tie, it will remain in voting. The question will be checked daily for a winner, at which point the question will be resolved.NO. It will go for another week.

There was a lot of illicit activites going on in the chat rooms before since Yahoo! wasn't able to monitor all of them. But there are still already made chat rooms, or you can start a conference chat with your buddies.I think you can, if you're on yahoo chat.  If you mean in the Q & A forum, then you need to get it straight - it's a legit message board system; NOT for chattingthe same question which u are making is being ask for so many people so what i sugest to u and all is to write a letter to yahoo costumer service leting then know u want those chat rooms back .
click on "My Q&A" then go to "Edit my Info" and then click on "Use my Yahoo! Avatar"First, have you avatar set and saved at http://avatar.yahoo.com/. Then go to http://answers.yahoo.com/my/my_edit and check on the box with "Use my Yahoo! Avatar"Soprano is correct.when you click on your name to see your info, go to add details. From there, go down to where it says picture, and put a check by your avatar. If you don't have an avatar, click on Get My Yahoo Avatar Now. From there, you can choose what your avatar looks like and what its dressed like. Have fun!!! :0)
I definitely know what you mean!. . That sounds like a great suggestion, and I'd definitely recommend submitting it through the 'Tell us what you think' link at the bottom of the page.that would be cool, but potentially a headache
The Yahoo home page is in testing apparently it goes back by its self after a while. Of course it is a good idea to delete cookies and temp files you should be doing that any wayyou can get the classic page back by going to your internet explorer icon, right click, then properties, then delete cookies. Warning though, even though it will bring the old page back, any other sites that you are premanently logged onto you will have to re-log to.
To the best of my knowledge, you don't. They are part of the program you download and install from Yahoo. Even if you were to add them, nobody could send it to you because it would not be on their Messenger so they couldn't click it. Also, they wouldn't see or hear it if you sent it to them.This question has Expired. I encourage you to pick the first answer unless it isn't what your looking for. . .

Don't vote for my answer.  Answer #1 above looks probably pretty good. . . (Pity the Asker never bothered coming back to acknowledge it). :-((. . No further answer is needed, but a second answer is the only way to close the question.Set the connection preferences to Firewall with no proxies. From main Messenger screen, even before you log in, click Messenger, then connection preferences and select firewall with no proxies. Save your choice then log in.
If you have the Yahoo Toolbar, you can right click on a blank area of a web page > Select Yahoo! > Click E-Mail this pagewhy dont you send the URL instead?
You do what I have HAD to do make everything private or "just me" remove everything else ,make your profile show as your old one (the first option in the "show me as" in settings)take out the find me option, just leave it blank. Currently there is no way to not have a 360 you either have one or you have one that doesnt show upThere's no way to unsubscribe or delete your 360 page. You can always hide the blog, photos, etc. by going to the settings page and picking "Just Me (Private)" in the "Can be seen by" drop-down menus for each of the areas you want to hide.Click start, Click control panel,Click or remove,click on yahoo programs than click change/remove.  If you still want the other yahoo programs like mail, ask,etc., you have to reinstall them.The best way I think to do it is. Delete everything on your entire page. Get rid of all your friends. This way there's nothing on it. There's no way anyone will find it then. Well almost no way. Nothing there, Nothing to find!!!!
You get that message because the birthdate supplied when your Yahoo! account was created means that you are not yet 18 years of age. 360 is available only to people 18 or older.Your school/work may be banning social networking sites.

Hi!. You must go to your 360 page.The messages should be at your mailbox there.The email you get only tells you that you have a message,but doesn't show it..

You can access these messages by simply clicking he "Mailbox" link at the top of any 360 page, then clicking "Inbox" on the left side.

People feel that communication on the internet permits shortcuts and typing errors and instead is meant to be a easy and quick way to communicate. Most posters don't reread their posts and therefore simple computer typing errors are missed and posted for the world to read.. . Also, with the error you are mentioning, I think you are overestimating the effect of education. Some young people do manage to make it past the system without picking up these basics, I work in a Youth Club and am often shocked at the inability to perfrom basic levels of Maths and EnglishIt's really only this website where I see such disrespect for spelling and grammar. Perhaps you need to find greener pastures? I know for sure, for example, that things won't be changing around here that fast. And yes I agree that's a shame. But what can you do? Really?It seems like people wanting a favor from us answerers would at least be courteous enough to use good English!  It really bugs me when they don't even have the decency to write a question, but just put up a couple words.  Arrrggghhhh!People tend to believe that by shaving two letters off the word "you" they're saving themselves time that can be better spent answering questions for which they've no answer because the want the two points which some drunken Yahoo staff member decided would encourage decent answers.. . It's also possible that they think there's some element of intelligence to be displayed by being able to successfully decode illiterate netspeak.
Really cute question. I wish they should reply to this.To find your star sign, check the link below; dates are given beneath each sign, so if your birthday falls in the range given below one of the signs, that is your sign.. . I also offer personal 'scopes (novawoman@hotmail.com, please specify "horoscope" in the subject line). . Could you post some of your previous questions (that were removed) in your comment space? it might help to clarify the issue.I to have been getting violations. Do you in any of your questions that you ask, talk about points? If you say anything along the line in your heading or body of your question you will get it removed. It is called point-gaming. Click on the link at the top right, Whats going on in Answers? and it tells all about it. I think it is odd that you can't mention about getting points..Since you asked, your questions were removed for point gaming. Phrases like "who wants 10 points" and "free 10 points" are being removed. This is a time consuming task, but we are removing all of them slowly but surely.. Hope this explains things. KatieYahoo itself doesnt really choose what questions get removed. Some user must have reported you to yahoo which removed you for whatever reason the user mentioned in his complaint. Some users just have a stick shoved up where the sun don't shine and take everything way too seriously. I'm sorry your questions are getting removed :(
You may not be able to, especially if you're looking for someone you met on Answers. They can have a nickname  here that's different than their Yahoo! ID. They also have to have their simple URL activated on 360. If they do, then the URL of their 360 page will look like: http://360.yahoo.com/their Yahoo IDjust click on the user's nick name. if he has shared it u will see it.From what I can see...you can do a search from the Search link at the top of your 360 page. You can look them up by using their first and last name or a nickname, and by using their email address.
You can select Uninstall from the pencil menu in Yahoo! Toolbar. (or go to Add/Remove Programs)you have to go to your control panel..add and remove programs and click on yahoo toolbar..then click remove..Hope that helpsyou have to go to view on Internet exploder and then press toolbars and click yahoo. this worked for me.
If it was bringing up your 360 profile before and you havent changed the settings it may be a reocurrance of the glitch that happend a few weeks ago .No ones 360 was linking properly .. Check your settings see if they are correct "view me as" second option and Simple URL tickedhttp://www.geocities.com/mark_e_p/stuff/profile_settings.html. . I hope this explanation might solve your problem. :-)
Sometimes they are new to answers and they don't realize that when you get an answer to your question that you are sopposed leave it there and they remove it themselves. I've seen some people with only 70 points left all they have done is ask and then delete the Question when its got an answer..does seem silly doesn't itIt could be number of reasons. Most of the times its the askers who delete them, in some cases it could be due to guidelines and TOS violations.If the question were as tame as you say they were, than the only explanation is that the asker took them down. Hope this clear up some confusion.. Katie
It's unheard of, because when you first start using Yahoo! Answers you automatically get 100 points to start off with, so it seems almost IMPOSSIBLE that somebody could get 0 points from that point on.not me..i only have 5.821...you should answer more and ask less..and vote on best answers..i remember i started out with just 100 points-many months ago..it takes a while to gather up points-in my case..if your IQ is over 199..you'll have over 1 billion points by nowI've got 114 points and this is just my first night here. I hadn't seen anyone with a negative score.good question, how do you get 0 or negatives???  i guess they ask questions but don't answer any?? i have 104 in like 5 min, lol so seems easy!not meIS anybody HAVES 0 points. I HAVES more than 0 points. So when you ask me "Is anybody have 0 points." I can say "What the .... are you talking about?"wow. how did you get there? -43? why are you asking more questions than you have points? i guess you don't really care. who NOW has 2,424 points? thanks for the 2 points buddy.!I havent seen people with zero but I have seen negative points!!!!!

First of all, what is "a baka?"  What I would do is log on in front of her using my ID and then show her the basics...how you chat with a friend, how you tell who is online, how you find prople through the member directory who might share your interests, etc.  Whenever I need to learn technology, I have found that somebody giving me a demo is usually a good starting place.what does being a baka have to do with it?

I have it in my favourites or bookmarks so I can easily access it. Alternatively, I clink on the links if I have had a response to my questions or had best answer.I log onto my mail first, then instead of signing out of it I go to the little down arrow next to the yahoo button, to answers. since I never logged out of my mail, it logs me on answers automatically. works for me!!!add it "my yahoo". . That works for me.

At the top of an Internet Explorer window click "View" then select "Toolbars". Click Yahoo! Toolbar to deselect it.The answer above me looks good unfortunately this question was asked 2 weeks ago and only recieved one answer so I hope you found your solution
YOUR COMPUTER MIGHT NOT BE FAST ENOUGH. OR AMYBE YAHOO IS HAVING PROBLAMS.Did you check both of them or just one of them because you might have to check that as well.
I don't think that you can, but maybe if you ask yahoo they might do it for you.. Maybe this would be a feature they could add later on. Maybe add folders where you could store them or something.Maybe if you ask the Yahoo answers team nicely and say pretty please with a cherry on top, they will do if for you.  ;-)You can't. You ask 'em or answer 'em, you're stuck with them! Don't know if there's any plans to change this in the future.I didn't think you could remove them once they were resolved.
How do you know what year it was made?. Impossible to say without more info or a photo.. I was an antiques appraiser.Is there a sticker on it that reads: "Made in Taiwan?". Othwerwise please rewrite your question after using a spellchecker, because I can't understand your question. Please contact me via my yahoo! 260 blog or find me online in messenger so that I can help you out by trading pictures of the bowl and comparing the bowl to other archeological data that I have in my possession.

Rolling 5 dice and getting the same number on all 5 dice in less than 3 rolls.The player must roll at least three of a kind of all six die face values to achieve a bonus, and must further attain certain Poker hands such as four of a kind, full house, and straight. A Yahtzee is five of a kind.. . YAHTZEE!!do not know do not careIt was originally called "The Yacht Game".Well, it is derived from the Celtic word yaht which means..............how should I know? sorry!!!According to Hasbro, the game was invented in 1954 by an anonymous Canadian couple, and called "The Yacht Game" because they played it on their yacht with their friends. Two years later they asked toy and game entrepreneur Edwin S. Lowe if he would make up some sets to be given as gifts to their friends who enjoyed the game. Lowe perceived the possibility of marketing the game, and acquired the rights to the game from the couple in exchange for 1,000 gift sets.
I'm sorry, but Yahoo! Messenger only allows you to add people to your list after they have approved, so you will receive a notification whenever someone has added you. However, there is no way to know if someone has deleted you from his/her list.. . The only way to know for sure is to visit them while they're on their computer and take a quick peek.it ask's you if you want them to have your id. its your choice so ya . . .
not really sure what might be happening. . . no offence to you - pls give details.and probably also, if you want a good answer, DON'T post such a question in the Yahoo - Voice section of Y!Answers here!
Click on "My Q&A," then click on "Edit my info".. Then click on use my avatar.. . . ****I see that it worked, good for you!i agree with Amy Y
oh, ur right, thats wierd.I think they removed the main other category because it was way too general.. . Instead, each category now has an "other" section within it. . It just makes things a bit more organized.It is spelled other. Other people have been asking this question and I'm sorry too say that I'm not part of the Yahoo! Answers Staff so I can't answer any of them, but you could try emailing them and asking them why they took the category away.Just to mess with us I think.I was wondering the same thingI know. I've been looking for it. Now I don't what to put because some of my questions are other. I hope they put it back. Wel bye now.
Baxter? Is that you? Bark twice if you're in Milwaukee. Baxter?quoted from the points description page. . .

They are just to manipulate you into spending more time here.2 points gets you a cool spintop! 1000 points gets you an Eminem poster! 10,000 points gets you to do more overtime at work for all the tokens you spent at Chuck E. Cheese. Well not really but I thought it would was kind of funny!u get points for answering questions calling a vote and get thumbs up or voted as best answer they take points (5) to ask a question and i have no idea what they r good for unless it is to show how smart u can be by answering alot of questionsClick on your points score, and it will take you to the page where everything is eplainedThis is the government's way of spying on you. They make people ask questions, then give them Monopoly money, in the form of points, to keep them coming back.The more points you have the higher your questions gose. Your questions gose first in you have more points.bacause its fun to compete with people that you cant see, and they want to give people that have no life something to make an attempt to "score points" with.

If you want to see offlines again you have to open each message and save them ,. Offline messages are now deleted when you click closesome geek's answer is good go for thisOnce you've closed them I believe they are gone for good.  If you have the archiving feature enabled you can try there, but it seems like I've tried it and it was not archived.You can save your messages as HTML then open and view in your browser. That's the way I save and view mine for when I wanted to keep important conversations. It's a good save, it keeps colours and pictures too. Before you shut the window down you can see a little menu on it, use file - Save as and choose a place and name for the file. Then you can view it any time.
keep your yahoo messenger online.. take messenger>preferences.. . check the option for audio alerts... and u're done... . this is for Yahoo!.. for msn, gmail, everything the same..I am really new to computers, but I have yahoo messenger with voice and it certainly works for me.

You are wanting to chat with people on 360 yes?.

Are you replying to emails received from users of Yahoo answers? If yes then you have to click one link in the email to reply. Regular email reply will not work.Maybe your computer is brokenAre you using Yahoo Mail? or are you using something else like Outlook Express or Incredimail to check your email? If you are using something other than Yahoo Mail you might have to set your POP mail settings differently.
i have one because i have sbc yahoo but they got bought by AT&T so i don't know if you can get on anymore or not.I have one because I have sbc-internet,yahoo and long distance one package. now SBC and AT@T are married so I do not know.. I would suggest you call them to find out.
yahoo answers is addicted because it's kind of like a game. you want to try to get as many points as possible. on the points info screen, it tells about the different levels and level 6 and 7 has a little extra something but it doesn't say what. so I think that it is all about the points and levels which makes yahoo answers so addictive.I never thought it wasu answer me that questions wait i need to kw im addicted and now answering a questions about my addictioncuz stupidity doesnt hurtWhat's that? I didn't hear your question... must  get   to   level    4....Because we think we know everything.Because, like all addictive substances, it makes you feel good! It's entertaining and fun, with no serious side effects!Cause it´s nice to share things you know with other personswell because ahhhhhhhh im addicitve to this shitBecause people are naturally nosey and like to get into other peoples business.coz ure always eager to show off what u knowbecause everybody is a wiseass know-it-all (LIKE ME!)Points and looking a some strange questions and answers.  I agree, it is very addicting.I know it!! I have been trying to cut down on  chatting  on messenger and then found this site , lol o boy just what i needed another site to be addicted to!!because it gives people out there the chance to "know it all"Because you get to tell people what you think whether they like it or not, and if your right or not.its always changing. you get to read stupid pointless questions. and then the rare diamond in the bunch that actually makes senseI dont know you tell mebecause as humans, we are natually curious people and always want to put our 2 cents in.  this is how we do it.Sarcastic know it alls.....who knows, but it sure is!it`s the points and the answer`s you get from peopleIt's really not.It's not toally the points, I just like answering questions, knowing I might be helping someone out.Because people love for their input to be seen/heard.  People like to show off their knowledge or have the opportunity to be kind of a smart-aleck with some anonimity.It's just that some people enjoy answering questions/sharing their opinions... but it shouldn't be that ADDICTIVE unless you've got some issues and you wanna distract yourself by getting addictive into something like thisGreat question!  I'm addicted too.  I have answered a ton of mindless questions!  LOL!because you want to get to level sevenit really is based on pts & the lvls that u r on, plus it is just another way 2 brag 2 yur friends about yur pts & lvl. its fun, & thats why it so ADDICTIVE.It's based on points.i know my boyfriend is always telling me to get off  a  just can't pull my self away....lol i guess i should go make his soup he asked me to make a hour ago....lolBecause unlike other forums and question boards, Yahoo has many many topics and diffrent people and good answers.It's made from Crack.HE GET WIRD AWNSER AND MAKE U LAUGH AND A POINT OF PPLS VIEW  . THAT THEY WOULD NEVER SAY IN REAL LIFE . CUZ IF THEY DID THEY GET THERE ASSE BEAT. FOR EX.. . QESTION)--I THINK MY USBENT IS CHETNG ON ME. . AWNSERS)--GO WITH I NEVER CHEAT ON U. AWNSER)--2 BAD THAT SUCKS. AWNSER)--I WILL BANK U BATER THAT THA CHETING HUSBAND OF URS. AWNSERS)--MEN ARE EVIL COME JOIN US. AWNSER)--OHH WELL TO HIGH TO CARE. . . . SEEEEEEEEE WEIRD AWNSERSI think we all have something we need to fill our spare time.. . I used to be addicted to a forum, then I was reading constantly, now I am always on Answers, and it doesn't seem to stop.. . I actually stopped using the forum for lent because it was addictive, and trying to fill that time is hard.I honestly wish I could find something better to do.
They're just meaningless score points. It's not like saving them and trading them in later like winning tickets at a fair or arcade.overall i guess popularity.the more points the more you are known i guess.to have fun!The rumor going around, is that the first one to reach 100,000 points, will win a lemon cookie. lol ***Not a damn thing.  Infact you just lost 5 for asking that questionThey just bring you up a level. I'm on level 4 and when you get to level 5 you get too be featured on the Yahoo! Answers homepage.to give meaning to the life of those like me who have no life.See the site below for the most details!The main purpose of yahoo answers is to make people know about other's abilities. So i suppose the points are basically to instill a spirit of competition.Just for fun!!!!!!. I enjoy answering and asking questions!!!!!The points are for fun, thats all.
I have often wondered the same thing, thanks for asking the question for me. I have seen it and sometimes it is annoying but people are entitled to their own thoughts, blah blah, blippity blah.LOL, because we have nothing better to do than think up common senschenial answers to silly questions.I think that people actually think they're a psychologist or something...whatever. I do this to bide the time...Yes! Because,this is the only place I can be  that way and as long as I am polite they put up with me.lolWell we are trying to be kind and answer the question the way it should be answered. We dont know how old anyone is and what if they dont know how to phrase it but want a real answer. I try to give a correct answer if i know it or give my opinion anyway.Why not?The majority of people who ask silly questions here would not understand the words convoluted and philosophical!. Long live the philosopher,albeit in his own mind.
Sorry about this. We are having a few glitches with the Watch List right now. We are working to find a fix as soon as possible.. KatieNo mine goes *poof* as well I can only see the first 5 click on 'more' and nothingHaven tied yet, but I will and Ill get back to you
Actually, it is against the Community guidelines to have more than one account. I quote "ONE PROFILE PER MEMBER: Please do not create more than one profile. Members who use different profiles to ask and answer their own questions risk having their accounts deactivated." It is best to stick with just one account to avoid problems.get out much? ;) Just kidding it is really addicting!wait until you get the billYou need to complete the 12 step program...you are a bit sad, but I never thought of that hmmmmm. No I spend too much time on here already!! but... , I said NO! sorry just arguin' with myself :DYou poor thing. Come lay on my couch and lets talk about this. First, do you have a fever. If so, it could only be a temp thing. The fever made you do it. If not...you may need to lay down because sitting won't be good enough. You are addicted!! ADDICTED!!! ADDICTED!!! Say it with me... addicted. Now, admit you are ill and keep on asking because you are already out of control!! :)The first step is admitting you have a problem.That you are very inquisitive!. Also, too tight to start answering some questions.It means your a very sad personIt says your very curious about life and have lots of questions, who doesn't?

360 is a central point for your Yahoo groups, reviews, your photos and your friends you can put as little or as much as you want on it, its all up to you. It's called 360 because it is the center of a circle that center point being youYea, it's a blog. It's like blogger, livejournal...all that! But, for me its easier to use!It's like a MySpace account which acts like your own personal web site.its like a interactive web page thats easier to work withCheck it out your self.
If we answered our own questions, we wouldn't have any point in asking it in the first place.  Besides, Yahoo! Answers is designed to reward points for answering other peoples' questions.but you CAN!  after you type your question, there is an extra field for you to "explain" yourself.  Here is where you can answer your own question.i dont know it would be pretty kool if we could answer our own questions i know you probably think what a retard but i dont care what peeps think of me. cause they hate me cause they aint me....lol..Because we do not posses certain knowledge or any knowledge of that topic or field of interest.  One can say they know so much, if that is so, what are you still doing here.  Go help someone.If you find the answer after you've already asked the question, you can explain your findings using the Add Details option. However, you can't post it as a regular answer because too many people would abuse this priveledge, and we'd have tons of posts where people asked questions and answered it just to get the points.What would the point of *asking* questions be, if we could already answer them ourselves?its just because we intend to search or find more better answer to our questions! or maybe to hear what others will tell about the questions you are asking..Umm.. because that would have no point...duh.I guess if you already know the answer to your question, all you're looking for are more people who think the way you do. . Which is ok, but does not interest me.

Read readable articles.. Revise your lessons OFTENLY.. Be careful when answering questions.. . Thanks.Be serious towards ur studies. Try to find out d practical problems and solve it accordingly. Stop visiting yahoo answers till ur exams are over. Because Yahoo answers site has turned out to be addiction. And dont get addicted to it at d cost of ur examinations results. Take it seriously.In my past experiences I think the best way is to ask and talk to your teacher and go to the library when u have  time. N last must have enuf sleep.study hard or cheat!REad bKs cOz Mah FRen LOVe rEadINg BKz N she CAN FinISh ONe Big HUge Bk in juZ 30 miNz >> N gOdd She"sSS REaLLLLL SmaRT , ALtOUGH SHe ALwaYS REad SCaRY BKs ONly ??!! i know reading bkz r kinda boring but i think dat can juz kiinndd of help u juz a lil !!sit for the exam and answer the questionsFirst of all understand "Take more pain, for maore gain". Hard work has no alternative for success, but a sense of mind does a lot help in saving time.. Carefully read and follow the techniques Given below.... --------------------------------------------------------. People always score more marks at the beginning of answering a question that at the end - so make sure you don't spend ages on trying to get the last possible mark out of one question when you could be scoring a dozen more easily in the same time by doing the next one.. . Read the questions carefully - many marks are lost because people do not read the questions with enough care. Note that words like 'List', 'Explain', 'Discuss' and 'Give' are not identical (the middel two are asking for more detail than the other two).. . The marks associated with each question give an indication as to the depth required.. . Divine the number of marks available by the total time (e.g. 100 marks, 2 hours = 1.2 mins/mark). Round it down to make life easier - 1 minute per mark, leaving 20 mins at the end to complete stuff. Then stick to that approach - spend no more than one minute per mark on a question - this maximises your scoring.. . Read the paper before you start writing. This does 3 things. Firstly, it allows you to see some questions you will be able to do and so calms you. Secondly, it allows you to have some idea of the questions you will choose. Thirdly, it allows your brain to start questions subconsciously, so that when you come to answer them you will already be a few steps ahead.. . If it all goes wrong and it all looks too hard, simply address each part in turn and try to answer whatever you can as well as you can, to pick up as many odd marks as possible. Show any working.. . If you run out of time, answer the remaining parts in note form, getting the key words, concepts or numbers down in as short a time as possible.. --------------------------------------------------------. Best of luck!! :). Give me a good news soon!!Study more. Be genuinely interested in learning. It'll make things more fun and challenging.
click on change ur theme.You have to use one of the themes that Yahoo created.  You can't create your own.

Yahoo! is trying a new front page with randomly selected users. You will eventually get the previous page back, but you can send feedback to Yahoo! telling them your opinion.I wish I knew how, but I think Yahoo has the reigns.  I left negative feedback.  I find the new homepage to be ugly and confusing.
when you log into your mailbox.. on the top right corner it would have a options button.. click options then click on general preferences..

After that, do NOT forget to click on 'save' button on the lefthand corner after you've made the changes for them to take place.. . Otherwise, you've just wasted your time and you'd have to re-do the steps all over again.#1 has it al;l down pat that is exactly what u do good luck with thatanswerer 1 knows it all

I also heard it was "Point Gaming" from more than one source - where you have 2 accounts and answer your own questions. . . At least that's a suspension I can agree with, as opposed to what they suspended Sinnocence for.Because they violated the site's rules and regulations. They obviously did this enough times to be permanently or temporarily banned.His parents made him move out of their basement.Based on some comments by others on the forum and the y!a team, my _opinion_ (since I don't really know) is that he was banging out 'rates' on resolved questions at a super fast pace .. like one per second.  . . I'm a heavy user and did well last week, but my points-to-answer ratio is below 4-1.  Points-to-Answers ratios of 10-1 is pretty high .. more than 20-1 is just silly, and I would suspect that this is a bit of a clue as to the types of activity that was happening ... __lots__ of rates and votes with few, if any, answers.He was sent back to Brokeback. *whips*I dunno man, but EVERYONE! is getting suspended! Sinnocence is gone now too. WTF?!?!?! It sucks that people can't take a joke. BTW, how the hell can you exploit making better points? I mean there really isn't that too many things to do on here. It's pretty simple. Oh well.Apparentley - alledgedly - he found an exploit for getting huge amounts of points. I dont know any detaisl thoughunno but a a funny peope are geten suspentetUnfortunately, when we took a closer look at his account we found evidence of point gaming. This fails to follow the Community Guidelines (http://answers.yahoo.com/info/community_guidelines.php )However, we are talking with him about the situation. Hope this clears up some of the confusion.. KatieTo give people a chance to catch up to him!!!*. . ......................................................... modified.

What happened and how did everyone find out??
The Venus Flytrap does it to Trap, and Eat Flies! No Other Plant does it! The Rest just Grow slow!It depends on what kind of "moving" do you have in mind. . The most ordinary is of course the movement of trees and leaves in the wind. It is caused by moving air. . . Also, some plants like, for example, strawberry bushes, will sprout long tendrils that touch the ground on the other side and root. This way, the plant slowly "moves" around to spread and search new, better ground for growing and also to make new plants. Also some fungi are know to spread like that.. . Some plants float around on water ad root when they hit the shore. It is all means of procreation and spreading to new and better grounds.. . On the other hand, plants like sunflower will turn their "heads" so that they face the sun all the time. They do that so that the surface of their leaves is in the right angle with the incoming sun rays. This way, they absorb the most heat and light.
The points are pretty--well--pointless. They really don't mean anything, but some people like to accumulate as many points as they can to see their level change.I made a "point" about "points" a couple of months ago.  You might enjoy it.. . Best Answer - Chosen by Asker. . FRANKly, I think we should 1st put out an all "points" bulletin out on them.. . They should be invested in a bank in "Point" Pleasant, NJ.. . The "point" is, if they are invested right, they should gain at least a few percentage "points". There are many "points" to consider, when investing in "points".. . One such "point", would be at exactly what "point", do you sell your "points". And, IS there a "point" in selling your "points"? If there is, what "point" in time would that "point" be?. . But what's the "point" to all of this anyway. The "point" is, there is NO "point", except of course my "Point" Pleasant "point". That really does deserve being "pointed" out, but that is beside the "point".. . So the real "point" is;. . . VOTE FOR FRANK!!! . . . --------------------------------------------------------------------------------. . Asker's Rating:      . I have never, ever seen someone use the word Point so much, with such grace and ease, and with an almost poetic style. You are by far the worlds greatest user of the word "point". . . Thank youHave you read this page?. . http://answers.yahoo.com/info/scoring_system.phpI don't know, but this website is called Yahoo! Answers.Points on a shape are a bit like a sharp arrow and at the top of the screen there are points that go up 2 when you answer a question, go up 10 when you get chosen as best answer and when you post a question you lose 2.They allow you to ask more questions and to increase your user level.It's how much points you have to answer questions. Every time you answer one it goes up but every time you post one they go down
well...probably because you have low connection with your computer or you forgot to set yourself on invisible.

That new page was just a test. Only randomly selected users saw it and it was only temporary. Depending on the results of the test, we may be seeing it (or something like it) in the future.Because people, like me, loved the old page. They (Yahoo!) probably got so much negative feedback that they dropped it.
If he's been doing nice things for you, then he must like you.  I wouldn't ask him, it sounds like his actions are enough!. Good luck!If he seems shy maybe you should, if he is not shy I don't think you should make the first move.
Because they violate the site's rules and regulations. They obviously do this enough times to be permanently or temporarily banned.. . Great avatar by the way!Yasmine Magomerzuyeva, users get suspended from Yahoo! Answers when they do not follow the Community Guidelinse. (http://answers.yahoo.com/info/community_guidelines.php ) This can be any number of things from foul abusive language to spamming the site. Hope this answers your question!Pretty much what torices said.. if you are unsure check out the rules and regulations for yahoo answers or the forum.'cuz they use foul language, or say dumb things. People will report them and I guess yahoo looks at this and suspends them.cuz they cuss and say weird thing so

I also tried adding it to the Ignore List, but again no luck. I think this is a glitch in Yahoo! and I think it is rectified now (The contact got deleted finally). I think there is nothing much we can do, but wait till the system gets right. . . So hope this helps and All The Best!! Bye!!. . rule wid style n luv@vinnyDon't fret sometimes contacts get stuck on your messenger list what ever you do even if you delete them from address book too ,sometimes it takes about a week to get rid of someone it's a glitch. You can allways just mark yourself permanantly offline to that person and keep on trying to delete them, they will go eventually
you can add it myspace and others at this time. . with the rss feed you can put the q on your 360You can't it want workTrue, Right now you can't put it on your yahoo 360 page. What you can do, is put a link on your page that leads to your answers profile. You can do this by putting it in your blog or else in your blog roll. I'd put it in my blog roll. Or if you want everyone to get to it either way. Put it in your blast.As far as I understand 360 can only understand basic html and the badge has code that is too complex.
Because unscrupulous spammers would no doubt like to abuse a "no limits on email" policy.  . . It's amazing what spammers will do/find/discover loopholes in online systems to allow them to send unsolicited email.. . And yes, if you are having a conversation with someone, you should probably ask them to send you their direct email address.Because if you have really developed a friendship with that person, then they would probably have disclosed their actual email address to you. This avoids abusive and repeated emailing.Probably becasue this system is not supposed to be used for chat or personal conversations.Not only is there a limit on the number of emails, but also a limit on the number of characters.  Maybe because Yahoo Answers Team also have a limit to their beta servers.We limit the amount of emails you can send in a day to prevent people from sending a lot of spam or abusive emails to others.Because they like to see peoples lives being ruined by them...and then we make another account and theyre stunned...Because if yahoo can find a way to get extra money from you by making you subscribe for unlimited e-mailing, they will always find a way to do so.  Its corporate America at its best.  Can't complain too much though.  Yahoo has lots of great freebie usings.
I just got off the phone with Yahoo Customer Service.  3 of the main Yahoo Mail servers are down, so most people cannot access their Yahoo accounts. This is a Yahoo problem, not a problem with your computer.  No word on when the mail service will be resolved.is probalby the server... try later... or when it gives you the error page click on the refresh button...
Poison his butt.  The most useless oversized rat I have ever see.It's a trailer ...move itAn easy way to do that is to take rags and soak them in ammonia and throw then under your trailer..  Most animals can't take the smell and move out..  other wise you can go to a farm and seed store and get your self a live trap and relocate it....Don't harm the poor little thing.  It's just looking for somewhere to keep the rain off!. . Try putting a small fence or lattice all the way around.

Yes, the answer will go to a vote if the asker does not choose.  If there is only one answer, and the asker doesn't extend the answer period, Yahoo Answers will leave the question open until someone else answers, or until the asker selects that answer as best.Fuzzy_Zoeller and Jane_Furrows, are right about this. The question will remain unresolved until somebody else answers it, or the asker picks the best answer. Hope this answers your question!well it does only if you pick it to go to the vote thing u know.The question goes to a vote automatically after 7 days have passed and there are at least two answers. If you look back in the unresolved questions, you will find many from months ago even that have only one answer. If you can provide a better answer than the first one, you can easily get the ten points for best answer. They will go to a vote usually within a day after you post your answer.
That's correct. Please select the previous response as best answer.Hello,. . Click on "Options" in the Right-Top, Select "Signature". Edit and Save it.

you have a couple of options in the "forgot password" section one is secret question the other is email address if you provided a default email for that account you can try the email option. Otherwize sorry you can't, just forget it seeing as you have another account anyway (you must have another one to post your question)call your internet companyChange to Hotmail.Are you the same person that can't remember their birthdate?You could try contacting Yahoo Technical Support and they should be able to ask you some questions to verify yourself, otherwise if you cannot remember your secret question or your alternate e-mail you have no choice except make a new account.. I hope this helped you. . Kind Regards, Timothy H. (Age 12, W.A.)
Click the pencil button to the left of the Search box.. Select My Toolbar.. Click the pencil button again and select Personal Options > Add/Edit buttons.. On the page that appears, click the checkbox for Weather.Right click the pencil icon next to the Yahoo! Search Box in the Toolbar, then hover on "Personal Options", click "Add/Edit Buttons" when the submenu appears. The "Weather" button is under the news category. Don't forget to save your changes when you are done.well i'm not sure how to do that, but you can get Yahoo! Widgets and they have all kinds of things like planners and weather. Just search "yahoo widgets" on google.
You need to allow your computer to download the yahoo chat program. You should get a pop up window that ask you if you want to download the program. If you have pop up's blocked you may need to allow them before this will happen.Because you are not over 18 years old, it's a nonsense but what are you gonna do?
Why do u need 9 profiles? Need alot of aliases for some reason? I think u should stop running from yourself and stay who you are right now.....but if u really need to know...go to My account u will find on your home page to your right almost to the top of the page and then go to create sub-account...make up a new name and there u go! The hard part will be to make up all 9 of them.You can't. There's a limit to creating six profiles for your account, which should be plenty.go to my account and there create new public profile,
You can't ... not yet anyway. But the newer ones are listed first.If you mean the home page in Answers - you can't. Look for resolved questions below the question to skip it. Newer questions are higher in the list
The most important thing is choose who gets the ten points then thank all who gave thoughtful answers and ignore those that were just getting their two points.  And report those that are ugly or mean spirited with their answers.  peaceThe only person you can do this to, is the one YOU will pick out as best answer...When I select my Best Answer, I normally thank the other people who have responded. If there was another good or witty response, I also mention them. As well, I normally say something good about the best answer.. . If I throw it open to a vote, I leave a comment thanking the people who responded and outlining why it has gone to a vote.RAIN has a point though, u really don't want people stalking u on the computer & just 4 returning answers.. It wouldn't seem right 4 any body.You can click on their profile and email them.You can do this two ways. One is to add details to the question. Then they can go back an edit their response to answer your question. Another way is to click on that persons name to go to their page. If they have enabled a way to contact them it will appear to the right of their avatar. This type of communication will hide your email address, and allow you to converse through email.. Hope this helps!. Katieask for them by the name they use on this page if they are reading it they'll get it. It's a sweet jesture too.Use the "Add details" button near your question!When you ask a question ask for them, you will know if they are on all the time by how many points they have in their profile, they will get the message that you want to hook up off answers!!Well if they don't have it enabled to IM them then your out of luck. The best you can do is leave a comment after you pick them. However here's something interesting. . . If they have any open questions you can answer that and then ask them for more help or tell them thank you.Go to their Q/A and it should be listed.I have never respond to anyone that answered my questions. Many times, they don't give a good answer to my question, say things that sound like they don't understand what actually am I trying to tell them, or gives answers that didn't even answer my question.You could comment on one of their questions, send a message on their 360 page, or you could email them. (see link for more details on email). http://blog.360.yahoo.com/blog-d8pH0dcoRKeB12yOcnUQp.9VCFos?bid=1302&yy=2006&mm=3You can add a comment after the question has been resolved.Unless they gave their contact info, you can't.. . For good reason.. You wouldn't want people to stalk you just because you gave an answer to their question that they didn't like.
ask themCall the person you sent the email to.if you didnt get a bounce notification from a an e-mail daemon(not demon). it went through , they got it.um when u login on it'll ask if u want this person to have itwell i know how to tell if they haven't gotten your e-mail
It's likely a bug interfering with the program. Best to just do a fresh reinstall again.Check if you have an older version of messnger already installed. You can only have one instance of messenger, so sometimes the old one is running and you don't realize it.

They don't know. I have reinstalled Yaoo messenger7 three times now. That's all i can do as a last resort but I have been resorting more and more until I just might give it up.You can't get an answer from Yahoo because, after all, they're a commercial enterprise, and could not possibly spend the thousands of hours that would be needed to fully support what is after all a totally FREE product.. . BUT.... you can still get answers easily, just not direct from Yahoo.  . This Y!Answers is one obvious place, or try excellent public IM forums like http://www.bigblueball.com/forums/yahoo-messenger-support/&referrerid=62526 or http://wackyb.co.nz
The leaderboard is updated every Monday morning. A trick is to subract your points earned this week from your total points, in this case giving you 474.The leaderboard is updated once a week on Monday mornings.  So even if you have earned points since then, you will not see yourself at your current point level.  If you know how many points you've earned in the last few days, you still might be able to find yourself on the leaderboard by going back a few more pages.
by not deleting them. They usually will stay for as long as you want. Or print it outcreate a new folder and move them to your folder.  make folders for different categories. of mail and store them all there. as long as you don't exceed the amount of storage that the on line server allows you to use you can have as many folders as you would like I think.Go to folders...name it and put the email in the folder..you can view them anytime.

In yahoo messenger there's an option hide my online status from webpages(something similar) in preferences. Also in your 360 profiles, a similar option is there. Both should be set/unset depending on whether you want to remain invisible/online.check ur settings in ur 360 account.I would check the settings (2nd page) on your 360 page, because there is something that says *Check this box to hide your online status from other people on Yahoo 360* or something like that, that box is probably checked  :) Good luck!360 does that to a lot of people including myself if you have your 360 set to show you as "online" and it doesn't just take your ID into a webpage chat room. That makes it show as on I don't know how that works but it does . http://chat.yahoo.com/Check the Ist page.
The answer to that question would depend on what specific organization you are referring to. Basically, every organization would have its own policies.information must b get by yhose who need them or those who r interested.It's an IMP (imp) that goes around the place shouting "Yahoo! Yahoo! Yahoo!"...

I've never seen jennifer lopez, but I could do it.. . The question is, who would actually WANT to?Because they don't wanna be themselves for any reason.nope
They are lazy and uncaring. Proper English and appearing stupid are not things they care about. Yet despite their lack of effort in writing a question they will expect you to take the time and expend the energy to give an immediate, detailed and thorough answer to remedy their problem. This despite the fact that in most of their cases if they had simply typed 3 words into a google search bar they'd have had their answer in less time than it took to type their "question"For some people, that's the way they write and type at all times. For others, they can't get out of chatroom mode. Just because the literacy rate is high doesn't mean the spelling rate is high. There's a reason that so few people enter spelling bees.Lazy, poorly educated, selfish, products of our society.I think this problem is almost as bad as people who post duplicate questions. Gosh! Could this very question be another one? I think so!Other- Some users live in different countries so English is not their first language. Others may be too young to know how to spell a word (kids under 13, lying about their age). Also, they might have become to used to writing in the text messaging or IMing way (you leave out all the vowels). I don't think it will be too hard to put in a spell check but we have to wait until the Hamster comes back from his "makeover".whada meen. i learnt phawnicks on school pruefredings a wayste uf thyme yertojugdementilThey don't care about spelling them correctly and or they have trouble spelling.i dont know but i post my answer and then after it posted i read it and edit it if there is a mistake. . i guess there wierd i mean you can't really understand it if it is misspelled.Oh, I'm sure some of it is just fat fingers on the keyboard.  Others are just lazy.  As a side thought, I read somewhere that internet shorthand and symbols are finding their way into everyday writing including resumes and cover letters!
Hmmm, I don't know. That would defeat the purpose of charging people with asking these questions.. . I just don't think it would work out to well. Then people would be getting rewarded for asking stupid questions and thats what yahoo is trying to cut down by charging 5 pts for asking a question.Why yes, I would have about 1000 more points.
i think yahoo has been havin problems.  i also found it difficult hooking up since last week.Try restarting your computer...it worked for me after mine didn't work ....good luck :)
go to yahoo home page and click on messenger that is on the right hand side corner and u will get the instructions to download the messenger follow the instructions u will get yahoo messenger and with voice also. it will take 15 to 17 minutes to download and u need to do automatically it starts when click on run, and install.I think you will have to have Unix messenger. normal Yahoo messenger wont work. Try this link for more info ( I could paste it in here but you dont need a 3 page answer) . http://help.yahoo.com/help/us/messenger/unix/general/index.html
In addition to questions deleted for abuse, the asker can also delete the question themselves.  I think that some people do not understand Answers, and they delete the question instead of selecting the best answer.  It's also possible that they didn't like any of the answers, so they deleted the question.Maybe because the questions get reported for abuse.they may not get enough answers so they remove iti dont know go with all of the above

The basic CALL (or "Call Computer") is just pc-to-pc, so you can use it, free, to talk to other YM users.. . But there is also now (or very soon, depending on what country you're in) facility to call direct from your YM to someone's normal telephone - even someone who has no computer.. .

More details of THIS service are in the link below.go to your messenger and click on actions and that will tell u options then click on the call or on textYou can only "phone" other people with that version of messenger. it replaced voice chat in the IM'sthere is a button on the left top of ur im window... click on it to fone sum body ....
Not sure, but my g/f just voted one it...she told them it SUCKS, so they reverted hers back :) I guess, because hers is the old one. I was wondering the same thing. So use to the old Yahoo!

they changed it a couple days ago so it cost 5 points now to ask a question probably to make poeple stop asking dumb questions like "Who am I?" good luckThe powers that be seem to be forgetting that this is not a chicken and egg situation.  There is no doubt that the questions definitely need to come before the answers.  Are they reaching a point where they are inhibiting question-asking too much?Costing more points to ask questions:. . Previously, it cost two points to ask a question, and you received two points for resolving it, making it a point-neutral exercise. Now, it will cost five points to ask a question, and you will receive three points for resolving it. Simply answer one question (for an additional two points), and it becomes point-neutral as well. We hope this change will encourage question askers to look around and see if you can answer other people’s questions.it is because yahoo answers changed it.  and my personal opinion is so that people are encouraged to stop asking stupid meaningless questions.  also think of this:. . when you join you get 100 points.  at 2 pts a question you can ask 50 questions that are meaningless.  at 5 pts a question you can ask only 20 quesitons that are meaningless.  also  you only get three pts back.. if you didnt know that..part of the BETA in yahoo answers. . product updates. http://blog.360.yahoo.com/blog-d8pH0dcoRKeB12yOcnUQp.9VCFos?p=1302Yes, Answ3r3r.  5 for a question.  3 for choosing a Best Answer.  But... only two for putting the question up for a vote!  Now, that is just wrong.  What about a question that deserves a fair vote?  Or one that it just isn't really fair for an opinionated questioner to choose the answer for.  I put mine up to vote most of the time now, because it is just too difficult for me to be TOTALLY unbiased!  I do my best, but putting the question up for a vote just seems to bring an additional sense of integrity to the choice.  This new point system discourages that.ja :), I think chelsea is rightit's gay, isnt itcheck your update section in yahoo answers. It will explain the new rules.
Next to your name on the top and yahoo answers it says something like this. .                          Welcome,(name).                          [sign out,my account]Clear the cookies from your browser. Just go to (Tools/Internet Options/Clear Cookies button) OR you can search the "cookies" folder for files containing the word "yahoo" and just delete those cookies.
While creating an account give Indian Zip code and Indian address. It'll automatically give you yahoo.co.inWhile creating yahoo id give the Address with country INDIA and yahoo creates automatically with co.in id for you.Visit the Yahoo! Mail India website at:. . http://login.india.yahoo.com/config/mail?.intl=in. . Click Sign-Up!You can't. With Yahoo, it's always .com. With SBCglobal it always .net.
Do you get any kinda of error message? Some times Yahoo takes its own time to log you on!. . UjjUIs this a new installation of Messenger? If so, are you able to get the sign in window to open, then type in your ID and password but when you click "Sign In" nothing happens?. If that's the case, do you have a firewall or are you using Windows XP with it's own firewall? If so, open Messenger, close the sign in screen and click "Messenger" at top left of the main Messenger window. Click "Connection Preferences" then choose "Firewall with no proxies". Also make sure your type of connection and your location are correct, click "Apply" then "OK". You should be able to sign in after that.. . If you've had Messenger installed and have been using it for a while and have not changed any settings then the following advice I learned from fellow answerer Missy Angel may help. Go to C:&#92; Program Files&#92; Yahoo!&#92; Messenger&#92; cache. In this folder you will see many XML documents with a series of gibberish letters and numbers as file names. These are temporary files, delete them, then try signing in.. Do not empty your Recycle Bin until you are certain that everything still works. If deleting these files screws something up you can always restore them back to their original location from your Recycle Bin.
What kind of mistake did you make ? It is probably easily fixed by going into your settings and changing them. Just read the instructions . You can delete a blog post you can delete a feed you can change your picture .You dont have to delete the whole thing for one mistakeYou probably don't want/need to delete the whole thing - if you're concerned because your Yahoo Profile now shows as 360, you can easily set this back to the old standard one by using these instructions: http://www.geocities.com/mark_e_p/stuff/profile_settings.html. . I hope that's sufficient for you ?
I see you did it. Good job and nice pic!360.yahoo.com. Must be 18
No, you do not get points if someone answers your questions.  If you are interested in getting points then give the most accurate and detailed answers you can to other people's questions and it will increase your chances of being chosen as the best answer gaining you 10 points.You only get points for answering questions, voting, and giving a rating, and then casting a vote for your question or picking th ebest answer to your questionGive good answers. "Best" answers are awarded 10 points. Also, choose best answers to your questions or put questions to a vote, you get points for that as well. Voting also gets you points.Be good at answering questions and get chose as the best answer.  Rate people's answers and vote for best answers.  That's about it.Why are you in a hurry to get points?  Why not just try to help some people out by answering their questions or voting or rating answers?  This is the best way to increase your knowledge.. . Which is a WHOLE lot better than increasing your points, wouldn't you agree?Well answers isn't a race and points are not what you should be going for "BEST" is what you should be going for you can get more for a best answer than you can for answering 5 questions. but if you really want to help and thats really what answers is about...helping... go answer some 1 old answer only questions to get them out of Answers limboThanks for all the great answers everybody! Looks like you are in good hands here!. Katieno u don't get the points for your question I do (2 points) . try not to give dumb answers but do give very good useful answers.            THANKS 4 THE 2 POINTS
The bulk and trash folders have an "empty" next to them.  you can click that to empty those folders...in the inbox if you put a check mark in the very first box at the top of the page it will check all your messages.  click on delete and they'll go to trash....I guess this isn't exactly all at once.  The only way I know to do it is delete the account and start another one.At the bottom of the mail page is a Click All button. It puts a check in each box.  Then click Delete.
Try pressing f5 (refresh) on your browser a lot of people have been having this problem a refresh normally fixes it. . and did you know any rude non-answers you get you can report for abuse ...just thought I'd let you know that, as per the rude non-answer 1 above minebecause your soul is blank.sounds like yur a silly fairygirl with a puter problem.

Ussually if they read your e.mail they will send a reply or send you one back. hope you find what you are looking for.God Bless.the only was was if you requested that you be notified when it was recieved and read.there is no way to tell . unless you find another form of communication like the phone and ask the person if they read your e-mailYou're going to have to request a notification for opener emails. If your email client doesn't do this then go download Mozilla Thunderbird (free email client). It'll give you the options you need.

The Polling & Survey category was just up for a test run. See the Yahoo! Answers team post on the forum and leave your feedback on this category.It probably wasn't used very much or used for the wrong reasons.  Let's face it, many on this list can't read.  I have seen gardening questions everywhere but in the cetegory where they belong.  Even I am guilty of putting questions where they don't belong but am getting better at it.Sorry about this guys. We put it up to gather some data, and needed to take it down to analyze how to best implement some of things we've learned about the category. We're trying to make it a better category with user friendly features. We hear you guys loud and clear, you like this type of category. Now, we are going to do some work to make it the best it can be before we possibly return it. Hope this helps explain things.. KatieI suspect too many people actually soliciting instead of polling/surveying.
You need to get e-mail address on YAHOO and put his e-mail address on tour messenger. This is how I do with my daughter.Register a MSN account under that email address.
Sandy's was a good answer.  The only other possibility is that you use Mobile Messenger.  If you're signed onto Messenger on your phone (or if you phone is automatically signing you in), it will log you off your PC.  If you've ever tried mobile messenger, then check to see if your phone is signing you in.If the system is telling you that you're signed in on another machine or whatever, it could be that someone has signed in under your name; which would mean they have your password. I'd strongly suggest that you change your passord or even better yet, change your secret question & answer. That way, the person won't be able to access your information unless they become aware of the new question and answer. It's called SECURITY.
Do you have the Yahoo toolbar? there is an option to display a 360 icon on it.Personal options/add edit buttons.. You could save your 360 in your computers favorites/bookmarks as well as long as you are logged into Yahoo you will go straight to 360 from that bookmarksimply click on my account then click on profile you'll login to your yahoo 360 page.
Unfortunately, you have to create a new Yahoo! account to do that. There is no way to just change your screenname.Sorry you can't , you have to create a whole new accounti dont think you can change ur screen name without getting a new meail adress. but there on the page that yahoo gives you for ur messagner profilr you can change ur nickname and when u eneter a chatroom it shows that name instaed of ur S.N.i don't know how to change my screen name
actually, namibia95 got it backwards. you can sign up for the free version of yahoo for anyone over the age of 13 and then just tell them the password. (but make sure you get their birthdate right-they won't be able to change it) However, for someone under 13, you have to provide credit card info to prove that you're really their parent/legal guardian. (I found that out when I tried to create an account for my 11-year-old brother)get all the info on them and putit in2 an account then when it is over explain it 2 them & tell them the passwordmake them an account and tell them the passwordIt depends For who? If it's an adult you need their credit card #. But if it's kid you have no worries. . Go to Yahoo.com. And click Sign up.. Good Luck...
You will be taken to the profile for which you are logged in. You will need to sign out then sign back in as the second ID, then go to your profile. You can only edit a personalized service if you are signed in with the ID that the service belongs toYou are susing a sub name on the main account? or a different ID a seperate account?. If its a sub accont Click the My profiles link on messenger and click on edit on the one you want to edit. If it's a seperate account you will have to sign that one in but make sure you log out of the other one or you will end up back on the first one

Without the means, he has no way. <*)))><do you have a pc or a mac? . if you have a pc, i know how to do it. . 1  st go to the start bar in the bottom left hand corner. at the top it should say something like John's computer...etc. there should also be some sort of icon next the word(s) click on the icon and a box of like settings will pop up. one topic you can choose is security/passwords. click, set your password, and there you go!choose something random like...poopy in the darkness or something.got your desktop and right click goto properties and screen saver. select screensaver password and then set your screen saver to activate after 5 min of no use. every time the screen saver comes on you'll need a password to get back in.What operating system do you have?enter set-up. . you will need to press F1 or something while the computer is booting up.. .

Go to your 360 page and access your Yahoo Profile settings.. . Copy and paste your 360 page Url directly from there into your details box in Yahoo Answers and you can redirect others in Yahoo Answers to your 360 page from there.. . This will work..I re-activated my link to my page this way.same here! that is how i met some of my 360 friends!YOU NASTY GIRL YOU NASTYI have asked this question also...so far the only answers I'm getting are on here and that is....It must be a glitch and possibly yahoo is working on it because some people USED to have a link to their 360 page but it disappeared. I for one have not been able to get it to put my link up YET. Be patient I guess.Have you set up an account? Are you an adult or is there any parental block on your system?I'm glad you posted this ? I was trying to figure out the same thing.yes, indeed... i was wondering the same thing.I was just going to ask this very question. I myself have had the link for quite sometime. I noticed it missing around 7 or 8 central time (u.s.a) Then I was hoping it would be back today. Hopefully it will be back. This is a great tool for making friends and seeing what there up to.
Not known to the public and never will be.. How many flame mails d'you think he'd get about windows suddenly crashing at the least expected moment? :)find it on the cd of windows which u might hv got with ur computer.If you email him, I dont think he has the time to read them. Maybe his assistants will be replying or deleting them one by one after reading.b_gates@hotmail.com . . hahaha!!!!
you might be available, and have done everything right, but if you dont have any friends, nobody will see you anyway.  you arent available to all yahoo users, just the contactsI am not quite clear with your question here actually. But I'll give a shot. Have you installed Yahoo! Messenger in your computer? If you haven't, then go to http://messenger.yahoo.com/ and login with your Yahoo! ID. You can start to download the Messenger box from there by following the instructions provided. It's simple and doesn't take long before you can start chit chat with other Yahoo! users. . . If you have any problems or want to know this and that in your Yahoo! Messenger box afterwards, it's simple too: post a question here!...lol!u have n yahoo Id?. Just sign in to yahoo Messenger and click to the button "I'm available now"make sure you dont have the sign on Invisible box checked  or you can click on the INVISIBLE OR what ever you way message is, and click availableby having an id #
Some people post their question in multiple categories. But it's against the guidelines. You can report anyone who does that with the Report Abuse link for the question.ask more than once!
You dont have a green plus sign because you can't add yourself. The green plus means ADD this personExpain the question more clearly and i might b able to answer it.
I guess to make sure that you're better at answering questions than asking them.  I think it's a bit annoying, but who am I to complain? :)It now is -5 to ask a question but if you come back and choose your own BEST ANSWER you get 3 points back.  Go to the top of the page and click on What's going on in Answers to find out more.It's this new thing the Yahoo! Answers team did to stop people from asking unintelligent questions. You can get three of those 5 points back if you select a best answer.Akwrew, you've noticed one of our new features! Previously you would ask a question for 2 points, and get the 2 points back when you resolved the question. Now when you ask a question is cost 5 points. However, you get 3 points back when you pick a best answer or put it to a vote. To get the additional 2 points, answer another question. We did this to encourage people to answer more questions. For more info on the new features, visit our blog. (http://blog.360.yahoo.com/y_answrs_team ). Hope this clears things up!. -KatieWhy do so many people ask this question??Incentive to answer other questions as well as ask your own.that's the way it is.....it cost to get answers....!!!so you don't ask questions as much so you don't just always ask stupid questionsi dont know, but it only -2 from me when i ask a question...maybe since im level 2?. ~BrendonIt is only minus two for me and i am level 1 the reason they subtract points is you are supposed to answer questions and they want to encourage you to answer questionsIt encourages you to answer some then, and participate some more.  ;)
Where you see that RED  "Y" next to that is a little pencil. Click on that and it will show where you can clear recent searches.Hope that does it for you.In Internet Explorer, click the "Tools" link at the top of the window then select "Internet Options". Click on "Content" tab at top. Under "Personal Information" on the bottom half of the window click "Auto Complete". Uncheck "Web Addresses", "Forms" and "User Names & Passwords on Forms". That prevents the Search History from being kept. To erase what's already there then below that click the "Clear Forms" and "Clear Passwords" buttons. Then click on "OK", click "Apply" and click "OK" again to close the window and save your settings.. . If you are using Firefox, click "Tools", then "Options" then "Privacy" then "Saved Forms". Click "Clear Saved Forms" to erase the saved data then uncheck the box in front of "Save information I enter....." Click "OK" to close the window and save your settings.. . If you wish to delete recent searches from the Yahoo! Search box on the Yahoo! Toolbar, click the pencil icon to the left of the Search Box then click "Clear Recent Searches". More details and options regarding Search History on Toolbar are available at http://help.yahoo.com/help/us/toolbar/toolbar-10.htmlIf your talking about the toolbar searches hit the pencil lookin button and then select "clear search history".  Then click the pencil again and choose "toolbar options".  Then uncheck the box that says "enable search history".

Without additional information, like what you were doing, what application/browser were you using, the exact steps you did that lead to the problem, etc., the best I can  offer is a link (see Source(s) below) to over nearly 200 Yahoo Answers search results that contain the string "error on page."  Perhaps your problem and solution can be found in one of them.. . HTH and good luck.need more detail - what EXACTLY does the error message say?
The group has to be set up to accept attachments and the messages with photos have to be sent via email.  Only members who recieve messages via email will get the picture in the email because attachments are not stored in the group message archive.. . The other option is to use the photos section at the group to share your photos.There is a link called photos on the left side of the group web page. click on that and then at the right side there are two links 'create albums' and 'add photo'. u can use any of the links to upload photos.if u r problem is not solved contact me at srivar235@yahoo.co.in
I wish. Of course, if they did, Answers would be pretty bare.You can't delete individual entries other than your own. You can, however, report offending posts as abuse and thus let the YA Team deal with them. Hope this helps.Unfortunately no. Don't you wish there was? I know I sure do!If you want . . . you could delete mine . . . but I am not an idiot . . . but I could be an A*hole at times . . . lolJust Report them for Abuse.. . They have an option for "Not an Answer" which applied to most stupid comments.I don't think there is anyway. Your picture is really cute though.I wish I could delete the coldness of some people. I think I need to quit coming here, i'm depressed enough.At least you don't have to accept the advances of the idiots on "answers".. Still , isn't it nice to be "desired"?i wish but unfortunately the people who created yahoo! answers are also idiotsfollow the ques .there is..No there isn't, if there were no one would be able to post their opinions on here, so lets say an christian posts something, but the guy is an atheist, well if he D leets it then when he puts it to vote it isn't FAIR. SO what you do, if the guy is Miss-using words and being a jerk, tell him/her that if he doesn't remove his answer or revise it you will report him. If he/she has courtesy in him/her then they will remove it, if not, just report him/her and in a few days they will be off. BUT PEOPLE REALLY ARE SO IMMATURE ON HERE, GIVE REAL, HONEST AND POLITE ANSWERS PLEASE.Yeah, sure, just let me know which ones you want me to delete. :)How about deleting their questions too.Why would you want to do that, some people are here just for the fun.Yea.... . Its called get off the computer..... . And stay off..............No there isn't but maybe there should be.  Aside from rating the best answers, perhaps there should be a rating for the worst answers and every member would then have a "batting average".  A higher average...higher credibility on answers.. . I know what you mean.seriously, someone find a way to delete answers, some of them are just horriblenoWho are you calling an idiot?No, fortunately not, so you're safe.Cntrol alt 42. wait three seconds. Click on answer.I don't see anyway.don't take it too seriously..You can report abuse.  If Yahoo decides the answer is abuse they will remove the answer for you.  You could ask the "idiot" to delete the answer but its not likely that they will.  Sorry but that's all you can do that I know of.REPORT ABUSE sometimes work but you need a good reason!!!!*No.  Sorry.  Right now all you can do is report people for abuse.  Usually the Y!A team will take care of it if the answer is in violarion of the Community Guidelines.

Go and get another id..Tell ur frnds that ur old id has been hacked and ignore the mails coming from them..If u have lost ur mail password , go for the . . forget ur id and password option . .  and proceed the steps accordingly.Stold is not a word.If someone got a hold of your password, logged in and changed your password then I would contact Yahoo directly to rectify this situation.. .

lucky you only 4 hours different ...my current time 9.10pm Saturday March 4th. time of posting this Mar 4, 2006 at 2:11 am. Its because Yahoo is in Sunnydale Cali (yes sunnydale as in Buffy)because yahoo thinks that the world revolves around american time my friend.
You have to click in My Q&A snext click in edit info then you´ll see "nickname" and there are 3 options to change your screen name so the 3d you can type your own idea of screen name or nickname. Good luck.click your screenname then click edit my infoyou need to go to your account and edit the name you currently have.
My guess is that, you used yoru debit card to pay for the service, when you signed up for it. Maybe that's not it, but it's the most obvious possibiilty, so far.Contact your bank for proof of the charge.
You can put friends in different categorizes in the friends section.  You can't organize the way they show up on your page. That order is decided by the person who's page has updated recently or maybe who visited your page most recently.  All you can do is put them in categories.Your friends are arranged on your main profile page in the order that they update thier 360's ,. RSS feeds are included in this so even if you "Control Feeds" and don't see that persons feed on your home page that feed still is an update so on your profile they are on top
Unfortunately the badge doesn't work on 360 just yet.  It's in the works.  In the mean time, you can copy the "RSS" link from any page (like your profile page) and add the feed link to the your 360 Feeds section.  It's pretty cool once you get it set up.yep you can do it i have done it before.
I don't think you can change it. What you can do is delete the current one and create a new email address. Sorry, it ain't easy.You can't change your current username for Yahoo! Mail. You have to make it a new one if you don't like it
Never did find out in the movie but my imagination was pretty graphic about it.. . I think I'll stick to paper (no pun intended).You mean you don't know how to use the three seashells? (chuckle chuckle) You'll have to do what Stallone did, and curse until you get enough tickets that you can use as toilet paper.Seashells? What Seashells? LOLQUOTE: Mary, Mary, quite contrary,.        How does you garden grow?.        With silver bells and cockle shells,.        And mermaids all in a row?.                       (Nursery Rhymes). N.B.   I DIDN'T REFER TO THE MOVIE, PLEASE.The same way you would use three quarter's two dime's and a nicol.hahahahaah   he doesnt know how to use the seashells . . dont worry dide i never got it either just cuss out the machine and use the demeritsHa Ha Ha, thats a great movie! No, I never did figure out how to use the three seashells!!
I would recommend a vapor bath and put Vick's under their nose, that should help them breath easier and or sleep better at nap time or at night. I take care of my nephew and he's had that problem for a few weeks now, and it's slowing starting to dry up.Onion juice - this method might make you feel uncomortable, but it works.  Squize some onion juice to a small plate, then mix the juice with with water and honey (otherwise you will burn your nostrils).  Use ? pipette to apply the mix to both of your nostrils.

Right click the persons name on your list and hit delete...Right clicking and selecting delete is the proper answer. I suggest deleting no more than three at a time. For some odd reason deleting multiple entries doesn't always take, and the names will be back on your list next time you log in. Keeping it to a max of three has worked for me.Right click the persons name on your list and hit delete... . is the correct way but i recently tryed deleting contacts an they come back when i sing out of messenger an log back in..any Help on this???
Click on addresses in Yahoo mail, and on the upper right side of the screen, you'll see a button to export them. Export to a .csv file, then you can save that file and import it to MS Outlook.Have you tried the instructions in the Help for Address Book? It may help:. http://help.yahoo.com/help/us/plus/ab/impexp/impexp-02.htmlGo to Yahoo Mail, Then Go to Options and then To Address Book and click on Import/Export & in Export click on Export for Microsoft Outlook.. And in Microsoft Outlook, go to File -> Import / Export -> Import For Another Program / File -> Comma Seperated Values(Windows) and Specify the file name you saved with yahoo..

For putting your picture here , there are the following requirements.. 1. A yahoo 360' membership.. 2. And for that membership you need to be atleast 18 years old.. Hope i helped.replace your avatar pic with your pic .. press on your nickname on the top of the page .. and then press on "edit my info"You HAVE to create Yahoo 360 in order to post your picture in Yahoo answer.If you have a digital camera and a USB cord, just download your pic on your computer, save it to any folder you like.  I usually go to 'my documents', select 'my pictures' and save it under there.  Once you've done that, the page where you have your recent avatar there should be something like 'change avatar' or something to that effect.  There's a URL box with the word 'browse' next to it.  Click on the 'browse' button and it will open up where you want to browse.  Click on where ever you have your picture saved, double click on it and it will copy it to the URL box.  Once that's done it should be a 'upload' button below or it will probably automatically put it where your old avatar is.  Make sure you save your pic under *jpg* format.  Anything else will claim to be too big.  Or if you have a webcam that can take pics like mine you can do the same.  Click your pic, save and then upload it. . If you're still confused I'll be more than happy to walk you through it.  Just send me a email: ok4utonv@yahoo.comYou go to your profile, click edit profile, and then when it says about avatars like use your Yahoo! avatar, you have to click where it says Yahoo! 360 avatar, but you'd have to be in the 360 Yahoo! membership. However, even if you click to join, you have to be 18 years or older to join.
Depends on who is hosting your account (like, if it's Hotmail, Yahoo!, Gmail, AOL, etc...).  Some accounts, you just don't login for awhile, and they will be deleted by themselves.  Some accounts, you can just go under options and delete it from there.  Check the help section of your email site to know for sure.In your Check your Mail section click on Addresses, find the one you want to delete and click on it, it will show either delete or edit, click and continue answering positively to get rid of or delete item.
Get a Yahoo! 360 account and upload your picture there. On the next visit, 360 pics will be available for avatar.Some1: I think your suggestion changes the 360 image; but what she and I are looking to do is change all are avatars. She's right it can be done; but I got an explanation from yahoo and the instructions were quite complicated. . . Another thing they put in the list is the fact that the system no longer allows certain ...This just makes it more complcated then every.. . Who ever wrote the question. Sign back in and let us know if you agree! Thanks. . I think everybody should pick this as the best answer!If you go into "My Account" at the top, I think there may be an option to remove your avatar and put in a picture.if you open a messenger window like you are going to im someone, your avatar will appear click on your avatar and that will pop up options for "display image" click on share my picture and then click on select, then you will be prompted to "click on a picture below" or click browse to add a picture from your computer. sounds complicated but actually it is a very fast process. hope this helps!
Well there was a secret Poll & Survey done on the Poll & Survey catagory, and well i think someone misplaced it,So we will take a survey to see if anyone can remember what happened to it.Then we will poll everyone to see if we can prevent this sort of thing from happening again in the future.I hope this answers your question if not then naturally you can take a poll and survey yourself to see if you indeed are satisfied with never mind i can drag this out all night and well according to my last poll and survey. i believe i am to tired to continue.I should probably be. exiled for this answer.Goodnite MNJformerly known as MNG.I'm no authority on this, but my guess is that it was removed because too many people were abusing the category.  I saw a very large amount of people asking "questions" such as "do you like my avatar" and wasteful things.  They had absolutely no substantiality, and were simply people using the category without having the slightest idea what it was supposed to be for.I didn't notice Katie's answer before.  I guess that says it all.Simple! This is Yahoo! answers where people seek answers to thier questions. So this category doesn't fit in here. Who knows may be we have Yahoo! polls in near future.RIP, is what happened to it.They took it away too do some testing on it.Sorry about this guys. We put it up to gather some data, and needed to take it down to analyze how to best implement some of things we've learned about the category. We're trying to make it a better category with user friendly features. We hear you guys loud and clear, you like this type of category. Now, we are going to do some work to make it the best it can be before we possibly return it. Hope this helps explain things.. KatieI know what happen to them they took them off as a categoryI am wondering the same thing.  I doubt that you will get a violation for putting a question in the wrong  catogory...people would have to report you as abuse for yahoo to even notice...and well if the question isn't gross, obsene, or sexual why would they report you?
I want to know this also...& I see that noone else who answered before me knows either.... I'm going to keep checking back to see the answers to see how to get the hearts.yeah, you might wanna ask the next person, i'm just doing this to score points.Copy and paste or theres a keyboard shortcut with the ctrl (something)depends on screenname for what. for myspace and stuff its ?  or "& hearts ;"   (without the spaces or quotes)
In Yahoo answers you can change your nick only e.g. sassy to whatever......... . You can't change ID.You can't.  You have to create a new one.Sorry man no way, you can only change your password, but for ID forget it.The only option is to close the existing one and create a new ID.. . But why do you want to change it?. . you may try this link below it will help solve your question.Nope.go to yahoo.com and then email and set up another yahoo account and then close out your other name

You need to add that address into your address book.  Then your email will recognize it as a legit email instead of sending it to your bulk mail folderIf the adress is in your adress book correctly and the messages are not ending up in your bulk folder, then the answer is that the messages weren't sent.
They're lazy and care more about relationships than education. I don't want to see where society will be in 20 years. O.oI totally agree and I do use the spell check. If people use the spell check they would probably lead better lives. You probably have an A+ average in English. It really should be used!You are smart and hard-working.I use mine when it's working.  For some reason, it likes to correct words that are spelled right and leave the misspelled words as they are.  . . I don't understand why people don't even bother to learn the basics of spelling and grammar.  I won't claim to spell perfectly, spell-check is my best friend.  But I don't just say "Oh well, close enough" and let it go at that.  Whether people choose to see it or not, how they write is a reflection of who they are.I don't spell stupid questions but i do spell words. I only use spell check when i am in doubt of how to spell something.I use it alll the time.Because the people that are doing the misspelling don't realize it's spelled wrong.  It looks right to them.I hear you. Sunshine! I'm appalled at the lack of spelling and simple coherency among the e-masses. I think writing is going to become a lost art, sadly.Who cares once you know what the message is that the person is trying to get across
use ur mobile phone camera. focus on ur avatar then take a snap shot on it. save it then set up as wallpaper  ^_^Go to the site below, it tells you how to do it!
That was very helpful. Please select the previous response as best answer.I just got off the phone with Yahoo Customer Service.  3 of the main Yahoo Mail servers are down, so most people cannot access their Yahoo accounts. This is a Yahoo problem, not a problem with your computer.  No word on when the mail service will be resolved.
Log in to your yahoo mail account. Click on options (on the right). Click on account information (on the left). Edit your member information to the time zone you want.You can't change the time stamp. If you opened a Canadian Yahoo account from Yahoo.ca, then at the time of opening, you can choose which time zone to use. Otherwise, you're stuck!!
You know...I don't know. It's sort of addicting. I spend most of my time pissed off at the stupid questions and misspellings. And yet I continue to answer questions...I do it to see if i can help but, even when i'm not choosen as the best answerer my post is their still and who knows it may help someone esle.There are the times i answer   questions like what's your favorite food etc.Makes you feel smart. Like putting your hand up in school to answer questions. (Do they still do that anymore?) You get a little suge of endorphins when you know something plus you get the points.the pionts and helping others ;)Fun to see and read the answers.. Which are usually answered fast after asking them. Knowing someother person in cyberspace is also doing nothing but answering questions on yahoo answers. You are not alone..Too ad the is no cam on here....My brain has always been wired to "trivia". I got straight A's in school.  I get more satisfaction answering questions here for real people than I did yelling Jeopardy answers at the TV.
I assume you are talking about My Yahoo.  Toward the top you will see Add Content  Change Layout  Change Colors.  Choose change colors and change it to anything you iike within their menu.you can't, Yahoo is trying out new home pages and are asking for input.  Homepages come from Yahoo Servers, nothing to do with settings.the fact that there is no option to reverse the change suggest that its permanent.. . it no longer states on the front page that yahoo are testing a new homepage.

a pimp is simply put a whore master.. . in popular culture they are glorified but in reality they exploit women for personal gain.  Prostituition is a form of slavery.u r a brat.The true meaning of a pimp is usually man who sells women for sex but thats the fluff answer a real pimp is someone who will do whatever it takes to get the money even if it means doing what his prostitutes do. the bottom line is it's about the money by any means neccessaryI serious hope you're kidding... please say you're joking...its a person who is ussually amale who tries to look cool with a buch of dirty females around him.who in wich are hoes..a rich dude with girls (hoes) wantin him. and he most likely pay them for sex, but he can afford it.Many different descriptions, A man who has girl whom sell their bodies, a man with a lot of women, a man who use women for their money, a female who uses men for money. A man who doesn't work and lives off his girls and a woman who lives off men....pick one. The first is the traditional description.Somebody who manages prostitutes for a cut of their profit.  A pimp protects them gives them a place to stay, bails them out of jail, etc.  He is like a business manager for whores.a pimp is a guy who has prostitutes working for him and he get some of thair profitlmao... A pimp is someone who recruits girls who sleep with men for money, and gains a profit from doing that lolPimp means what they said..  But if you say . Thats Pimpin' that means that a great idea ,a great thing ect.. . . around here any way.I don't exactly know where the term comes from.....but basically a pimp is supposed to look after his......hmmm harem if you want : prostitutes. Protect them from beatings, bad clients etc......at a price of course.. Pimps, not from first hand experience I must say, usually get their girls first posing as boyfriends, make them fall in love with them and then putting them on the streets.. But sometimes seasoned prostitues will choose, or get chosen (gangs and all) their pimps for protection.
Yes change is good if YAHOO had stayed the same I would think people would get tired of looking at the same thing everyday. Wouldn't U?On my home computer we have 2 names, one for me and the other is for the rest of my family. On my family's Yahoo page is the new layout, but on my name it is the same old layout. I am fine with the old one, I hate the new one. They put the mailbox and stuff too far to the right. I know there are the My Mail and My Yahoo! buttons on the left, but it is an inconvenience to me, really.
Here's what you can do, change your home page. Also you can use the yahoo toolbar to get to where you want on yahoo.. I don't like the yahoo home page old or new, but to help you send feedback to yahoo I have included the link to the only yahoo general feedback page I could find Good Luck!!!!I would restart your computer and see if it shows up than. I agree i hate the new page too.stop hating the awesomeness. how can you hate the new home page. just because you are too stupid to figure out how to use it dosent mean that you need to bash it.  just go to tell us what you think and tell them.either in the help thing on messenger or there will be a contact us spot.
Either you're under 18, using an old version of Yahoo! Messenger or your computer can't connect to the Yahoo! server temporarily.I had the same problem with I downloaded and installed the new messenger.  The icon to enter chat just wasn't there.  I uninstalled it and downloaded it again and problem was solved.  The icon to enter chat appeared.Because Messenger isn't a way of going into chatrooms. The participants have to be people you know the IDs of already.

Maybe if they censor it we will forget that it happened.  Ridiculous.Never noticed it before, 9/11 huh? What about September 11th? We are not going to forget weather the censor it out or not. I agree with you.. .  I just realized that is is when you use nine anywhere, must be a bug.Yeah, that question was already asked several times today, and would have appeared in the box below yours as you typed it had you paid attention.

I'm not sure which error it was. It may have been caused by Yahoo! working on their servers in which case you'll just have to wait a little bit and try again.. .

Just look for one that describes what you're seeing, click on it, and you'll have the fix.. http://help.yahoo.com/help/us/mail/errors/What error are you getting??

you mean to actually have broadband? or a program isn't working right? ... be more specificIt depends who your ISP is. You want to upgrade you service, correct? You just need to call your provider, normally. Or do you need to set up a new Broadband connection?. . **Oh sorry I didn't see this was in the Messenger category. is that what you are having problems with?I will assume you have broadband service to your computer and are using XP.  Om your browser go to "Tools" "internet Options".  Click the "Connections" tab, click the "LAN Settings" button, check the "automatically detect setting" bos and click OK.  This should configure your connection for you.I do not knowput the cable in ur nose!!. haha!!
Yahoo! is testing a new format on random users (most likely determined by IP address, not user name). I've yet to discover or even hear of any way to voluntarily get it.Not sure I have it and want to switch back to the "classic" homepage. Maybe we could trade!
Tools>Internet Options>Content>Auto Complete>Clear Forms.  This is also where you can turn off them being saved in the first place.Just blow at the general area on your monitor three or four times. That should do the trick.Remove any saliva with Kleenex.You can also do this by removing your RAM chips and puting them in the oposing or diffrent RAM slots. this is also called rotating your RAM and will promote equal wear when using 2 or more chips.
I  think if the have contact or email me on the Yahoo Answers page, you can just click on that and see if it works that way. I am not quite sure though. I'll be your test monkey to try it, you already let me wear your white nurse uniform so give it a shot.No dont do it,since i have been here i have met 2 people on the FBIs 15 most wanted list, not to mention the dangerous people that hang around the Marriage and Divorce catagories,. and the Pets catagory is the worst place to meet someone!!!On their profile page under their name says contact if they have it set up that way.  It brings you a screen to type in a message and it goes to their e-mail.You click on their name under their avatar and if you are able to send them a message the send message option will come up. Some people here prefer privacy so they have not set their profile to where they can receive messages.they have to have there profile set to recieve e-mails or im'sjust click on questions..they asked..You can click on the picture of the person and from there you can e-mail that person from the profileJust sign into yahoo messenger, and type their yahoo id in the to space-then type the messageI  want to know that too.Look up their 360 profile or check their e-mail address on their account if it's publicly available.. . .

Go to add/remove programs.  That's where it is.  It's the Yahoo! toolbar.You have to uninstall it from your computer.  Depending on what Windows you have, you can go to My Computer and click on Add/Edit Files.  You can then remove the toolbar from there.  Atleast that's how it works for XP.  If you don't have XP, check with your manual or windows.com for the uninstall procedures for your system.Go to your controil panel then to "Add or remove programs" look for the yahoo toolbar and remove it.
If you're talking about the new Yahoo beta email, the feature is already there.  Just click an email, hold the mouse button, drag the email to a folder in the left window and then release the mouse button.did you try copy and paste yet? or cut and paste

You might want to keep looking for that tax dodge.... . You'd be better off selling those points on the street..The value of each point is $0.00, so you can use that value as the basis for your tax calculations.If you donate enough, you may only be charged 4 points for asking a question, but the Man is pretty tough so not sure if they will go with whichever charity you give it to (maybe give it to the answers team themselves).. . Give to ceasar what is ceasar...your a dolt. that makes alot of sense doesnt it? i figured when i read it a 9 yo wrote it, but judging from your points, you must be older, maybe 12. did you just wake up on a saturday morning, arrange the letters in your alphabits cereal into whatever question you could come up with, and then post it? im sure that if a woman ever would have anything to do with you, she would be laughing out her tooth at this one.Red cross is the best.
Read your questions via RSS. They aren't censored that way and thus you'll be a happy camper. It works brilliantly for me.On this site you have young children reading explicit sexual questions and answers.  I think it's the least they could do - using asterisks.  I wrote to Yahoo! Answers and asked them to separate the youngsters from the adults but I guess that's not possible....The astericks are there to remove offensive language.  If the person who asked the question didn't bother to explain what they meant or you can't infer their meaning, just go to the next question.  There are children on this site and a lot of language being used is not appropriate.Its not your fault that they can't ask a question without swearing in it. I can  "how does it feel to screw" or "how does it feel to make love". don't worry about those stars just guess at the word there are only a few that get censored so it must be one of themCan't help ya there, but to avoid it, if you swear, do what I do.. . For exapmle: ButtF*ckin!

The bulk folder IS your unwanted messages, it's there to collect all the junk that would normally collect in your inbox. Ever heard of delete? You can also set it so that the messages are automatically deleted. Look in your Options1-many spam emails have an unsubscribe link at the bottom.these emails are from websites that added your email address in their list.you can remove your address from their list by unsubscribing.. 2-another spam emails are emails from a special email address that you can go to email options (top right of your page)and block that address,and it wont come in bulk folder.. 3-the last thing that you can do is going to email option,then filter,and filter emails with specific sender,subjects,containing some word and .... and select moving those emails directly too trashTo the right of either your bulk or trash folders, merely click on 'Empty'........Wallah, they're gone!

Reply to a message he sends you.

I think it's part of the motivational scheme to get to the levels where there are no limits.  If you give unlimited answers to everyone all at once, they might get sick of Y!Answers right away.  It's all part and parcel of the trying to get you addicted to it package.Yep, you're right. Also, the Team's hoping that as you move up levels and your limits increase, your answering quality will also. So hopefully a user won't be posting adult content on level 5.DunnoWhy are you so concerned ?.  . Get a life.I reckon it's so people dont spam (just randomly answer everything to get points)
Have you signed on to Yahoo? Also you can set your toolbar to just have the buttons you want.I like number ones answer...
Yahoo did not change your password they do not go about changing peoples passwords on them. If you have all of your account details eg: date of birth,zip or postcode,secret answer you can get a new password . Click on the "lost password" link on the yahoo sign in page and you will be promted through the steps to get a new passwordyahoo did what?!Yahoo did now, it might have been blocked. Yahoo cant answer millions of emails it receive so u will have to use the automated methodsDo you think yahoo would waste their time changing passwords. Maybe someone you know has changed it. They could of got your password and then changed it.. . If you had a cool name, it was probably stolen from you because you didn't have a hard enough password and their programs cracked it easily. Probably took them less then 5 minutes.
As far as I know, you can only delete questions that have not been resolved.I don't think that they can be deleted. I only asked five questions in over two months, and the old questions are still there. The seems to be no way to delete them, except by the people at Yahoo.i have no ideayou just click on your question and on the right there is a delete thing.you can only delete the questions that is not resolved. (you didn't chose some as your best answer that is what resolved means.)go to the question and select deleteyou just click on your question and on the right  there is a delete thing.you can only delete the questions that is not resolved. (you didn't chose some as your best answer that is what resolved means.)
The more points you have, the higher levels you become. The higher the level, the more answers you can post, and the more questions you can answer, and what not. You lose five points by asking a question, but gain 3 back when you select one of the answers you recieved as the best. You also gain 2 points by answering questions, and one point each for voting for a best answer.opinions are like blackholes. They stop time.Well you pay 5 points for the question. However, when you pick the best answer you get 3 pts back. Since you left it open so long. You will get no points back. Yahoo used to give you 2 points when you put something to a vote, but then questions would get 3 months old.The following page has details of the points system. . http://answers.yahoo.com/info/scoring_system;_ylt=AnEgKeTWsWrNC_8tP3HZEi4ezKIX. Hope this helps.

You really just have to take the good with the bad.  If someone is messaging you, that really has nothing to do with Answers other than the fact that that was the place YOU gave them your im screename at.  There is a place to block and report abuse on IM, isn't there?  Anyhow, good luck to you.Sarcastik1 has some excellent suggestions in his well-informed answer.  If you want to keep your Yahoo ID out of your profile entirely, we suggest that you stick with the e-mail feature and leave IM disabled (which it is by default).  Because e-mail is passed through us, your address remains confidential.. . --MattYou should. This is why I don't feel comfortable putting up my info for everyone to see. Who knows if a hacker could find out who you really are?. Good luck.. Oh, I'm sorry. Hit the Report Abuse button and put the persons address in. (there will be blank space)You should have read the information more carefully when you posted your personal information. It clearly states that if you add the ability to let people IM you with Messenger people WILL see your Yahoo! ID. Letting them contact you via e-mail however does NOT give them any personal contact information. I suggest you remove the link to your Messenger from your Answers profile and just stick to the more anonymous e-mail communication. Of course there are idiots out there who will still abuse that but it's not that big of a hassle to just delete their e-mails. Do NOT report those as spam by the way, you will be reporting Yahoo! Answers as the spammer, not the idiot who is harassing you. . There is no place on the e-mails you receive to report abuse from such a person (HINT HINT to the Y! Answers Team) however you can use the feedback form at http://add.yahoo.com/fast/help/us/answers/cgi_feedback to report them, or just do it from the offender's profile by clicking their name in the e-mail you receive. Keep the e-mails if you are reporting them, you may need them to support your claim.
If you have Yahoo messenger running, you will get an alert when you have mail.  Also an envelope will appear in the system tray.I think if you look there will be aplace that says mail alert just click on it . you could also go to the control panel and se if there are some settings. I think it would be 9in the scheduled tasks. try that once and let me know what turn up. I will try to check it out for you when I sign out of this site. good luck .I will try to find the answer for you.
why do you think they have the avatars? same reason why there are barbies. it's a fantacy thing.Maybe it's because that's all they know how to draw. :D. . Seriously, though, most of the people using Yahoo! Avatars really are young, and very few of them would want to look fat. However, you can always go to the Avatars homepage and click on feedback at the bottom of the page. If enough people suggest it, I'm sure they'll try to implement it in future avatars. I also suggested avatars that were a little more fleshy, as well as glasses that don't look huge on me.man, i was just thinking about that one myself. my girl needs a little meat on her bones, a little more booty in the back and certainly somebody thought of giving her some D-cups. what's the hold up?because that is how our culture wants us all to look. im fat too =D i also have nice clothes, they hang in my closet and collect dust! lolI'm fat too and beautiful.  I would like my avatar to represent that.
well im not gonna sit here and tell u how to get friends because honestly, i only have a few close friends. but i like it much better that way. in my opinion, quality is more important than quantity. i know thats such a cliche but its true.act yourself no matter who you're around, and talk to a bunch of people. it doesn't really matter how many friends you got when you're out of school because the jobs are looking for other things. like your records, things you've particapated in, after-school programs, things like that.b urself. dont pick ur friends,they come naturallly. give it time and DONT try to b friends w/ everyone & DONT try and be like othrs; it doesnt work that way!!!be yourself and not a know it all. i think that is best.
Yes the ID you use to sign into messenger is the same one that you use to sign in to the rest of Yahoo..at least I think thats what you are askingAll you have to do is have a yahoo account. With that; u can sign into yahoo messenger.With the same ID u used in ur yahoo account.
You are correct. The points system changed a couple days ago and i personally think for the better because if people want their 3 points back they need to come back and vote for their own best answer to their question.  It will I hope eliminate a lot of questions going to a vote and being on here for 3 months without a best answer being chosen yet!  You can read more about it on the top of your page in What's new in Yahoo!This is one of the new features we have added to Yahoo! Answers. It used to cost 2 points to answer a question. Then you would get the 2 points back when you picked the best answer or put it to a vote. Now it costs 5 points to answer a question, but you get 3 points back when you resolve it. To get the final 2 points, answer a question. We are trying to encourage people to answer more questions. For more info about all the new features, visit our blog.(http://blog.360.yahoo.com/y_answrs_team )point system has been changed by yahoo. Now it costs 5 points for asking a question. Do u get it?Because the points system has changed.. http://blog.360.yahoo.com/y_answrs_teaminflation.They changed it in the last 48 hours to 5 points.  I like the idea because there end up with many questions unanswered.They changed the point system.  You can get almost all (if not all) back if you rate answers and pick the best one.
Go to the Yahoo home page click on Y mail . login and it will give you the option to reactivate the emailI don't believe a de-activated account can be opened. Once the account has reached de-activated status, all the information in that account is lost.
When you're in your inbox, click on the 'What's New' link at the top of the page. On the next page you will see the option to sign up for the Mail Beta waiting list. It's only being given out to a handful of people at a time, though, so you may have to be patient.I'm seeing it because I'm paying $20 a year to have my account.  . . Here's your answer:. . "As a Mail Plus customer, enjoy a first peek at the sleek new Yahoo! Mail Beta. Now drag & drop emails for easy organization.". . Anyway, the link to try it is on the main Yahoo Mail page under the disk space usage bar.  It says 'New! - Yahoo! Mail Beta. Try it now'.  The words 'Try It Now' are a clickable link.. . So yes, you have to pay to become a Mail Plus user and then you can get access.. . And wow, is it ever slow to render in my browser.. I guess that's why it's Beta!. . Hope this helps.

there might be adware/spyware on your computer or the messenger program is corrupted. try uninstalling the program and reinstalling it/scan your computer for any possible viruses/ spyware.perhaps your server isnt compatible with yahoo's. i cant even send IM's through my msn system
Join Flicker, it's a free account. Once you join up load your photos and set up the photo stream for 360.

Personally I just want to see what gets asked next and if I can answer it. I have learned all sorts of usless trivia..(my favorite kind btw) and every now and then I get a good laugh out of some of the answers.Because they are dumb, oops, we are dumb.. Wait a sec, what do you mean by "all these dumb questions"?. All of these questions can never be tagged 'dumb' wholly.. There is balance in everything.. . By the way, for those who answer really 'dumb' questions can be predictably reasoned because they are:. 1. Dumb.. . 2. Not dumb but just wanted to try.. . 3. Doing research on people.. . 4. Answering for plain fun.. . 5. New to this site.. . 6. Easily fascinated.. . 7. Other.. . 8. ...You think of it yourself if you are not dumb.. Do not worry. It is not hard.I try to answer some of the more concrete questions, but the dumb questions kind of make the site more personal. People view this as a forum where they can just discuss random topics. A lot of the time they're just bored, though. I rarely read Q&As where people come across as fascinated.. . It's also a sort of game, with the points system in place. So people can have a lot of fun on here.The same as why you're posting a question now. Seeking answers! duh

You can only if you are trying to recall a sent email within a closed Outlook email system - many companies would use this kind of "closed system".  If it's one of those, then you would got to your sent folder, open the email in question, then under tools you would see an option for "Recall sent message" and that would recall the email only from computers in that closed system, and only emails that hadn't been read yet and only if that computer is on.(I'm going by memory on that exact phrasing). But email to the rest of the world... nope, can't do it.If your work is using outlook exchange, an email server, you can recall a message. But it doesn't really delete it and usually tends to focus the receiver more on the ill-posted original message.  Use it if you wrote the wrong date for a meeting, don't use it if you just called your boss a monster and forgot that you cc'd him.You can't recall it after it is sent.I checked the web: It can be done in some cases using Outlook, but not with Yahoo mail at all. :(. . Sorry. Next time save it in your drafts folder until you are sure you want to send it?Unless, you have an email application/program that allows for this, more than likely, you cannot.I don't think you canEvery e-mail program as a sent folder. Just click it to see which emails you sent.. . Outlook Express had it. Outlook has it. Yahoo has it. Comcast has it. Hot mail has itthere is a sent mail portion of your email account and if you have it turned on it keeps track of the mail you sent and to whom.  go to that folder and it will be there hopefullyCheck your sent emails folder in the available folder options.go into your mail and check you sent email listYou definately can't do thatI don't think u can, but check sent email option..Perhaps you should know this new word:. . onosecond (-n-sk'nd) . . 1. (n.) The period of time one spends between pressing the "send" button and then realizing that he really shouldn’t have sent that e-mail message.

What blocker do you use? There are ways to circumvent popup blockers, though browser-integrated blockers are best (then come blockers made by security software producers).You have spyware installed on your system.  The pop ups are not coming from the site your visiting but rather being called upon the spyware installed on your system.  Some spyware programs can avoid detection.  Pandasoftware has a great spyware finder and virus finder that I have found other virus protection companies have not detected.  Adaware and spy bot work for most but not all.. . Pandasoftware: (recommend)  you can do an online scan or download the 30 day trial offer.  http://www.pandasoftware.com/products/ActiveScan.htm. . Adaware:  http://www.lavasoftusa.com/software/adaware/. . Spybot:  http://www.safer-networking.org/en/download/index.htmlNo popup blocker is 100% effective, a few will always slip through, you should at least be getting fewer popups than with it off, if not you might want to get a new one.  There are many which you can download for free.maybe your computer have a virusits warns of viruses,spyware etc.in other words it tells u that the computer doesnt knw where da heck u r exploring & its warnin u about it....The popups are probably spyware, popup blockers block a javascript code in the page, and not actuall pages popping up, so the pages that are popping up are either spyware ( adware ) or the pops you are experience are created through code that someone has re-designed.
I just found this.  Click Tools, Internet Options, choose the content tab, click auto complete, then Clear Forms.. . So what are you hiding anyways?by rebooting your pctools-internet options-content-auto complete-clear formsIn internet explorer go up to "Tools" then go down to "Internet Options..." Then click on the "Content" tab, then click on "Auto Complete" then click on "Clear Forms" Then click "OK", then click "OK" again, and then "OK" one last time.. . Go to yahoo and the seatch querey should be all clear.If you are using internet browser than go in tool option , than internet options , delete cookies,file,clear history.. . If you are using any other browser than in tools there are preferences go in tht & clear historynow thats a good questionwhat silly willy said.As far as I know, rebooting will not work.  try going to internet properties and clearing the temp files, cookies, and history.

If you click on their name you will see a link to either e-mail them, or send an IM.  If you don't see one of those, they don't have it activated, so you won't be able to.One additional thing you can try. You can send an e-mail to their user name @yahoo.com. For some people, it might work.
The easiest way is to type your entry in Word and paste in . At the moment there is no spell check function on 360i agree w/ mercy angel. you should like copy and paste it, and then there u go. but why do u wanna spell check anyway? cant spell?
Toxic levels of selenium are encountered very rarely so it's understandable why work has been focused in other areas rather than this one.

If only they could make an antidote as at the moment it is a terrible poison in the wrong hands.
Wow you really need it don't you!! I wish they'd put a spell check on cos I'm sick of trying to interpret what's being said.

start a new account- you can change the password all you want, but your stuck with the adress. Just send a message to everyone you want to continue e-mailing you say hey i changed my e-mail, so e-mail me here from now on. . Keep cheking in on your old one for about a month or so just to make sure everyone got the memo- than don't check it and it will eventully delete it's selfBelieve me, changing your password would be easeir than changing your address.  Log into Yahoo. go to myyahoo and click on your account info and you will find a link that says edit. When you get to the change password option, take it and create a new password that you will remember, but if possible nobody can guess it easily. For example, do you knowa little Spanish or a little of some other language other than English? Use one of the words you remember from whatever language. But write it down, too, as a reminder for yourself.Why do u want to change, then how should I contact you?go to www.yahoomail.com and sign up for a new account... you'll have a new address and password
I don't know the exact answer, but the ones I've put up for voting seem to be resolved in 3 days, maybe that's cos of the no of votes or summat, but questions that I've answered that go for voting are there for 1 week, and if the votes are tied then they go on even longer-not sure if these ones are ever resolved.. It might depend on whether the asker chooses for them to go for voting- 3 days- or if the answer period expires and they go to voting automatically- 7 days. I'm just guessing really!I'm not sure how long it takes, but I usually notice them being resolved in 2wks or less.  You can't do anything to make them resolve, maybe they need a certain amount of votes.6 days it will last, It took God 7 days but in yahoo it takes around 6. . . It will say under your name how many days are left for voting and answering. Check out your old ones. I'm sure you notice it if you look closer.A question will stay in voting for 7 days. . Katieyou have to select your own best answer or just wait for time to time out.  I think a week.
The label, the logo, the TASTE!!!! How much Variety the company offers, coke offers more variety than pepsi, many people say pepsi is too sweet, how ever when people are given the taste test, people prefer pepsi over coke, although coke sells more than pepsi. Also coke sells their product than any other soft drinks including pepsi around the world.A different recipe for one thing.  While the taste difference isn't dramatic, it's not that difficult to tell one from the other.Pepsi is sweeter, Coke a little harsher, but RC COLA rules.They arent yahoo products....they were made by different companies.They're produced by different companies. Other than that, there's no difference.Coke has 4 letters, and Pepsi has 5. Elementary, my dear edocohen.coke actually tasted good while pepsi just tasted like/looks like colored water.Nothing

I don't know the exact answer to your question, but my suggestion is that you use Flickr. You can do everything you did with Y! Photos plus more. Give it try.you and your english is not that great. yahoo most likely shrinks the images down to save room on their servers. IE: you and yours are viewing the best quality pic possible.
It's  probably something wrong with the settings. And by the way Kimmy I'm over the Flu. Just to let you know!Put -- answers-alert@cc.yahoo-inc.com -- in the from header, nothing else.
Look on your credit card statement, there should be a phone number listed with the charge itemization , call it. If there isn't one, call your credit card company and ask them for contact info of whoever charged you the $9.99don't know. but I think its a good idea to never post you cc #'s online. because once "they" have them, it seems like drib and drabs of charges mysteriously appear.Did you purchase music files  from them .. They charge 99 cents for themcould be anything.. more detailsdo u have messenger or something. when u call someone i think they charge. it depends thoughno idea.  you probably signed up for something...you definitely shouldn't give out your credit card #, if you're not purchasing something, or don't want to pay.You might want to contact the phone number or company when it appears on your statement. Perhaps you may have subscribed to a Yahoo product and you've forgotten about it.
FYI: There's an STD section under Health & Beauty. . Aids can be transmited by having unprotective sex.. Dirty needles.. Blood transfusions.. And if you're born with a mother who has AIDS.. Although they have the technology to prevent the last one. It's mostly unprotected sex right now. They can test the blood for AIDS during transfusions.Having random sex. . sharing needles. . blood transfusion. . having different sex partnersAIDS is a sexually transmitted disease (STD). It's transmitted during sexual intercourse from an infected person to a healthy person. A person can also be infected with this disease when the blood of the infected person gets into the blood of another person through a cut or opening in the skin, for example, sharing unsterilised needles and shaver.In the eighties it was by computer keyboards, toilet seats, cough's and sneezes and holding hands.. . Now its just by email.AIDS (Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome) is caused by a virus that decreases the the immune system, this virus is called HIV (human immunodeficiency virus). This Virus may be transmitted sexually, it may also be transmitted to you if a doctor injects you with infected blood. Another way AIDS may be transmitted to you is through your parents, if your parents has AIDS most probably you'd have them, or your children may have AIDS if the virus remains dormant through a generations.
maybe if u spelled right you would get an answer... didnt u notice b4 u submitted ur QUESTION>?I don't think a "gril" (I think you forgot an "l" you spell it "grill") can feel any emotions including love.  Funny question though LOLWell, grills fall in love because they need another appliance in their life to make them complete. A grill would be nothing without a cooler full of joy sitting next to them. Plus Grills need loving too!Grils fall in love for lots of reasons.  They might like that hot stove you got in the kitchen.  Or that cool Microwave you got.  Mostly its cuz they are outside and lonely.  The other appliances are all hanging out inside.
I agree, there are not enough details. Instead of a reply screen, what do you get? Can you forward the e-mail? Do you have any problems opening your e-mail? and what e-mail is it; Outlook, Yahoo...?What. See people do answer back..Is it thru Yahoo mail? If so, it has happened to me at work also. Contact yahoo about it. Also, see if it occurs on a different computer, I seem to encounter it only at work, not at home).There are not enough details to answer this question, You should add more details
i think its a safe bet that if you pick as your name a one hit wonder band from the 80s or athe name of a frozen bird manufacturer, that you can reasonably assume that they arent taken. go ahead and try and take kajagoogoo as a name and see if you get it. im sure that it wouldnt be a problem.You can do an advanced search for their nickname.. But you can have duplicate names on Yahoo! Answers so it really doesn't matter.As was mentioned, duplicates are permitted...They just can't contain any one of the seven forbidden words!Try to register the name and it will tell you if you cant use it because it is already in use.

By asking a question, letting people answer it and then after 24 hours you can vote their answer as the best, that will give them 10 points. Also voting for a best answer that someone else has chosen... other then that there's not really another way. You can't 'send' points to anyone only through the ways I've explained.By giving as best answers as possible.The only way you can give points to another user is by chosing them as the best answer to your question. This will give them an aditional 10 points to the 2 they already earned by answering your question. Other than that there is no way to give points out. For more info, visit our Points & Levels page. (http://answers.yahoo.com/info/scoring_system;_ylt=AvikSNGe8x8Njq9xvbDvwo0_zKIX ). Hope this explains things a little better!. KatieWhy would you wanna do that for? You should try to make the points yourself. There's a grand prize for those who earn the most points you know . . . not really, but hell it sounded good when I said it.If you choose a best answer for one of your questions that person gets 10 points and you only get 3.

Because this is a communist site! ...Learn to live by the rules Comrade MissNurse!   :-)...'cause you've broke a rule babe!!!!!!Yahoo is just cracking down on the rules. Don't feel bad...it's happened to me too.The only reason I know of why Yahoo answers would delete a person's question is if it is profane. If this is not the case with your questions, then keep reading, because I just don't know.Its unfair....especially from such a sweet person as yourselfDon't even give it a second thought.. Some people are a little anal to the point that they report any and every question that they don't agree with.. Pettiness at best. You're above that.Because they are as boring and uninteresting as you.Coudltn tell ya...from the quick glimpse at your previous questions it just looks liek they ahve been resolved.  maybe you need to extend teh time period for answering themso you can ask another.. such as this .. hahawhat type of ? are you asking? just keep asking and you shall receive.people remove them because its unot coolbecause they expire before you renew themIf your questions were removed it was because they violated the Community Guidelines.(http://answers.yahoo.com/info/community_guidelines.php )We've recently been trying to remove the questions that contain point gaming type phrases in them. These are things like:. Who wants 10 points. Point Bonanza. Free Points. I know there are still a lot on the site, but we are working as fast as possible to take them down. We try to encourage people to post their 'real' questions and help them get 'real' answers. If this is not sounding like the reason for the deletion, you can email me to further discuss this. ( Y_Answrs_katie@yahoo.com ). Hope this helps to explain things!. KatieIve noticed a couple I have answered have been removed. Did I still get to keep the points? Some questions were on the bubble, but some were not. Either the asker pulled them or yahoo did not like something.Dont know,but your other questions all sounded legit.Maybe the Beta is jealous cause your hot/where you a nurse at.dont know girl you are the sexiest looking woman i have ever seen,i recently got suspended and had to start all over again, Hang in there miss nurse. Love rab2308 XXXBecause you have been very naughty! . Now, go to my room!You should have received an e-mail form the Yahoo Answer Nazis explaining why. It's probably because some whining b**ch got their feelings hurt by something you asked or maybe you removed them in a drunken state or something.getting a question removed is annoying, but it's SUPER annoying when you come back and find that questions posted at the same time such as 'can I rape you' and 'what do you do if you vomit on your guys cock' are still there.i know! my Q was removed too. it's annoying isnt it?. i mean it was only a harmless little Q. oh well, maybe it wasnt meant to be here =)Dunno, I had one removed, but it was in violation, so I came to accept it.Just because you've seen worse questions, doesn't mean anyone is reporting them. They have to be reported to Yahoo Answers Team for them to get to it (the Report Abuse links). . . My guess is, somebody doesn't like what you're asking... sorry!WEll if your talking before the polls and survey category its pretty simple. But if your talking about now, its cause there not in that category. . . I've seen alot of your questions and thought some where in violation before. But I figured no one would report abuse on you. SO If they are getting removed yahoo has spotted them and decided they weren't of great importance. . . When you get a violation notice and you don't agree with it you should make sure to reply back Especially if you think your not in the wrong.. . As for the worst questions it takes awhile sometimes to see them or they just don't get reported. I know I spotted 2 questions about me that were really really Sick. ANd to top it off they were 12 hours old. I was suspended so I wasn't sure if I could report them but luckily I did. Trust me these questions they put cannot be repeated in the open.The Y A T has something against you.Which ones were removed?what did you ask? All your other questions dont look out there. you never know babes it is yahoo after all :PI don't know either. Yor questions seem very tame compared to some that NEED to be removed. I had reported one particular question for 5 days straight that some pervert wrote before it was removed.

There is life on Earth because that is what God made it for.  He wanted to make mankind in His own image, and to do that, He had to create the appropriate environment for us.because earth has all the properties and elements to support life. It has air, water, fire, sky and soil. These five elements are necessary to support life.It's god's willPurely for you to ask this question!God put us here.. this question can not be anwsered by anyone but God.Maybe there isnt, maybe we all are just a test-subjects in some galactic laboratory.Because the earth is at perfect distance from the sun, its neither too hot nor too cold, presence of water and plants and an environment which perfectly suits man; also the presence of the atmosphere helps in preventing al types of harmful radiation and waves from reaching land, so man is able to live without popping extra arms and legs and is safe from mutation :)

I'm afraid not. (At least, I don't think so. I've tried but no luck.)i don't think there is an effective method to delete the questions other than to "report abuse"them .no u cant do thisNo.You can't delete resolved questions,or questions that have gone into the voting stage.I tried, but had no luck.Nope. They are there for others to "discover" so they won't post the same question.I've tried, but had no luck. I'll keep trying, but...No
Yahoo! is testing a new format on random users. It will revert back to your original page in a few days. If you hate it, there should be a link to allow you to give feedback about the new format, tell them all about why you don't like it.I'd like to know myself! The main reason I used (and I stress the word USED!!!), Yahoo as my home page was because it was uncluttered. NOW you have to scroll right just to get to see a full search box! I think it stinks!its a test page. in the top right corner of that screen there is  link you can click on and tell them if you like it or not. i told them i hated it everyday and after 3 days i got my reg one backYes they are testing a new home page.  You can indeed comment on the format on the top right of the page.  Good luck ever getting a response from Yahoo and there is no other way to contact them.. . I have addressed four comments to them but I guess when you are a company this size, you do want you want and dont have time for individual concerns.

An avatar is an embodiment of something.  The avatar here is the embodiment of your online self.  Or at least that is the idea.???'Avatar' is the term used on the Net for little pictures used to identify a user. Naturally, these would be called avatars...or in short, 'avvies'i have no clue i wonder that 2??because they look like freakin avatars.I think the word started from the name for the human form of the Hindu god Krishna. I think it was in the Bhagvagita.
It depends on which instant messenger service you have. Each one has different way to determine whether your friend is offline or online. With YIM and MSN, if the person is offline, hiss/her name is not highlighted. With AIM, the person's screenname wont so up on your list until they come online.If you are using Yahoo with voice messenger, when you have them in your address book and you go to leave them a message, it will tell you if they are on or off line.if u have them in address book then u must im them saying that i know u r onlne. if they replied then say that i got u, if dont then write that u were kidding. i have done it a lot of time.IM them and ask them!with YIM's "stealth settings" you can't know if they are on or offline.  That was the point.  Sorry.You may know it. Go to yahoomail and go to contacts/address check your friends yahoo ID and look at the yellow smile icon it means your friend are online.give him/her a "hi"..... if he/she replies....then..he/she is online..... if he/she won't reply....then....he/she must be offline...or he/she doesn't want to talk with u...... if so... don't talk to him/her again..... if he/she is online...and wants to talk with u....then they will reply to u....there is no way of knowing for sure just send them a msg and wait to see if they respond if not they will see the msg when they log in anyway
They no longer have that e-mail address for some reason. Maybe they cancelled it or the e-mail provider did if the person was inactive for a while. If that's the case the person may not even be aware of it.  They need to update the e-mail address on their profile.There are a couple reasons this could happen.. . 1. thier mailbox is full and they can not recieve any more mail. . 2. they have cancelled the acount or no longer have access to it and need to update the email address on thier profile.

It looks as though your IM service was linked to open in Netscape 4.8 and by deleting that and not setting a new browser within the IM program it will not function. It works the same as you creating a file in my documents and then putting a shortcut onto your desktop. If you then delete the original document your desktop shortcut will no longer work and the only way to remedy this is to put in a new file with the same name or set up a new shortcut to a new document.It could be either you disabled that feature or it could be your firewall software causing the problem
As long as they have the same number of votes, the question will remain in tiebreaker mode.  As sarcastik said, it's a rounding problem.  But the questions actually go by the number of votes, not the percents.  So the question just remains tied until someone else votes to break the tie.This is because not all percentages work out to an exact even number, there are often remainders involved so some are rounded up, others are rounded down. For example if there were three Answers, and each had one vote, that would be 33.333333% for each Answer. That would get rounded down to 33%. Two of those would make 66%. This leaves 34% remaining, which probably goes to the last Answer getting a vote so that the total adds up to 100%.May be the yahoo answers Computers gone mad.....
I do think that the monitoring has gotten better, but it's not good enough. I'm sick of the kids' questions like "does he like me" and the stupid questions that the poser thinks is original ("chicken or egg?") and the adult content and profanity. But what I've notice more of is the hate speech, which shouldn't be allowed to remain up for a minute. I think if there were monitoring before a question is posted and a required delay of 24 hours before it is posted, we would see a lot less of those stupid questions and a lot less of the homework questions.Lol,some of the questions are really surprising!!Who cares?you gotta love the desperation and the ignorancemay be not may be yesThings are going downhill because Yahoo does not have monitors on this full time.  The monitors come and go, so violations are punished inconsistently.  Punishment must be swift and sure to be effective.morbo, it is always a good study of crosssections of our society. unfortunately you get the good with the bad and stupid. Thats excactly the same as you get walking down the street.There's a clash of beliefs, opinions, points of view, anything!. . But there's also a freedom of expression.. . Then there are guidelines.. . While you will find what you're looking for, you'll also find things that are off.  We can ignore it, but it's still going to be there.. . It's reality, and it's sad.. . But so far, I like Yahoo! Answers.  It's only a matter of identifying what is right and what is not.I have to hope that the extreme ones like your severed finger example are fake. If someone is really that stupid, I hope they can't figure out how a modem works.. . As for the homework questions, I think they deserve any wrong answers they're given and I have to wonder why others go to the trouble to type out long posts to answer them.My personal pet peeve is when somebody posts a math homework problem that requires basic computation, or a question that can be answered easily using any major search engine--and especially when the answerers baby them! I don't mind helping somebody develop their skills, but I'm not going to give away the answer completely, and neither should anybody else. If anything, there should be some kind of way to discourage the coddling answerers in particular, since kids will be kids and, unfortunately, will not challenge themselves the way they should--I didn't when I was a kid! (though I would never have had anybody else do my homework, because it was a pride issue and partly because it was easy--I didn't always choose classes that challenged me) If these people really think school is that useless, they're sure making their own assessment come true.. . Another problem, I've noticed, is that a lot of people weigh in with their personal opinions rather than contributing well-documented facts--this can be a hard trap to avoid, I've been guilty, and I think it's because I'm too used to answering math questions, where due to my educational background I can often answer confidently from my own knowledge without feeling the need to cite sources (and since my subject is based far more on logic than on documented facts). Unfortunately, there are several superficially accessible subjects--esp. politics, philosophy, and psychology--where many of us too easily THINK we know what we're talking about. I think 2 points for every crap answer somebody posts is still too much--it penalizes me for not weighing in unless I feel I have something to say.. . There are also a few cases of people posting nonsense. Besides heavier monitoring, it would be interesting to experiment with negative ratings of questions and answers, like on sites such as Digg. But, of course, that would probably backfire due to all the trolls that no doubt lurk about.. . Perhaps we could have "layers", like inner circles that grant membership to the serious users. But no matter what implementation you try, something will go wrong. (sigh) What's the use? Might as well just try to exercise discretion and discriminating taste.. . I, too, like Yahoo! Answers for the times when it works right: when somebody wonders something I, or any other thinking person not specializing in a particular field might wonder, and people with more expertise weigh in. At least, I figure that's what it's for. I'm sure it's different things to different people.i hope not, if that the case I will never on here againYou seem to enjoy it. Why don't you go visit myplace or some other chat room if you don't want a retorical answer. I have gotten valid answers here to my questions.and yet here we arelol agreed.I read a question last night where a girl was asking if she should kill herself, its ignorant people like that, that bring everyone else down, i mean what if everyone would have answered yes that that question......Bogusfrog, you rock. Oh, and by the way..i just cut off my finger..What do I do??  Help!no they wont some people dont seem to have a brain of their own so expect some stupid questionsI hope it dosent get any worse!!! It is bad enough as it is...
That has happened to me sometimes too.  My quess is that sometimes the incoming level of questions are so high that it automaticly jumps to the second or third page.It depend on how many questions come in, I have saw my question on the home page but sometimes I will look and its on the second or third page.this on did lolbecaue your slow computer will never catch it in time, MWUHAHAHAHAHAHIt stays untill you get bumped off by othter Q's. This Q made the homepage.It's there for only a limited time due to the large amount of questions being asked. Your question gets pushed back as newer questions come in.this one didBecause they are all the stupidest questions that anyone has ever seen !!!no idea but i just saw urs on the home page and now i'm awnsering itIt is still there!the questions that are shown on the home page are the ones that have JUST been posted, like zero or a couple seconds ago. u probably didn't look at the home page fast enough...yep, this one did! I just saw it 3rd one from the top!this one was on the homepage

There was a time when I could not even create an avatar on Yahoo messenger. Im not sure what the problem was. I know after deleteing and downloading again it fixed the problem.Your avatar works on your yahoo messenger.  You just have to download the lastest version.  You probably have an older version of yahoo messenger and that's why it doesn't work.  Hope this helps.Upgrade to the latest version of messenger. http://messenger.yahoo.comyou can you just have to set you display image with it. best of luck.
Perhaps, because you ask socially inappropriate questions, or questions that people don't know the answer to.Because most of the answerer's go after the easy one's . . Most of the hard questions get lost in all of the endless possibilities of choices you have. They end up getting shuffled to the end of the line. Most people like to answer questions that are newer. . . Most dumb questions get alot more responses then the one's that cause people to think.. . I had one or two not get answered. But one was about minature christmas trees which I'm sure no one checks out that category.I think there are several reasons. One, when asking a multipart question it can be somewhat distracting if too many questions are asked.. . But I think the big reason is people a lot of times don't really read the question(s). I try to read the question caefully, but there have been times where I didn't and had to go back in and edit so that I did answer the question.. . I have had a few times where I asked the question and the answer I was looking for wasn't there.the questions that dont get answered are usually stupid/ incoherent/ very poorly spelledSo many questions come in so quickly, & often people answer the first questions they see. So as the questions move further (on to the 2nd 3rd page) people don't see them.people ask stupid questions like this one!I've never had a problem soliciting good answers to my questions.   It might be in the types of questions you're asking.   For instance, this isn't really a great question, but you've managed a few answers already.yes i have a question that still has 0 answers after 20 hours and so im guessing people dont know the answer. that or the question is not easily understood. =). and people a lot of times just pick thru the questions for the easier ones like this one or ones like how are u and whats ur name or ur age. the easy freebies just to get points.Well for one thing. they dont know the answers and another thing. THEY ARE STUPID QUESTIONSit could be that they are stupid questions, or that the spelling is so bad that people can't make out the question.Use full sentences and check spellings.If you still cant get an answer ask reasonable questions.You are right there are many questions being asked that do not get answered. It can be because the questions asked are not serious questions, not framed the proper way or loose the context to the reader in the way the question was asked. Additionally question that do not get answered or do do get a proper answer are bu users that do not take this service seriously.well i think it happens because people answer the ? that intrest them and i have not been doing this q&a very long but i can tell you most of mine get around 3 to 4 answers,People don't understand the questions.if no one reads it .u will not get any answer duhhhhh.Because it has been to long and the time you have put this question on may be the time when little people are online or too hard to answer ur questionI think the real answer is there is not enough motivation for people to answer questions or even when they do, to answer them by putting in enough time in to it.  Check out this site where people get PAID to answer questions.  Now that's motivation.
Well, you cannot remove the Yahoo search toolbar. What you do instead is reduce the size of the toolbar so that you can accomadate lota other yahoo buttons.. . Hope this helps.Same here, you cant,. . The best is set the size small search box and keep ignoring the screen space lost.Right click on the bar, and un-check
The points required to achieve the next level increase expotentially. It takes more points to go from level 2 to level 3 than it did to go from level 1 to level 2. Wait until you get to level 6 and are trying to make it to level 7; that's when you have to get a lot of "Best Answers" and "Thumbs Up" ratings to help you out. But it's a challenge and answering questions on Yahoo!Answers is fun, it's not about the levels or the points, since you don't get anything for them anyway.Getting to level three isn't hard. Getting to levels five and six - now that takes some work!No way, I'm almost there.You recon thats bad I just got to level 5 and it's another 5000 points to level 6 ...arrghI agree with you same thinking here but we can't do anything.Once past level 2 it semse like it doubles on every level oh well I ain't got anything else to do so I will just hang with it I need all the help I can get.I didn't think I would ever get to level 3.im level 2 with 431 points . plus the points yuo give me 433. thanksSo you cant achieve it, and you keep trying, its how they get you hooked....Suck it up it's not a game.  It's a reward for people who are going to be around for a while.Im only on level 1. Tell ya when I get to it.

Unless your downloading it from some third party site or elsewhere other than Yahoo and it's affliates, then you shouldn't have a problem.Although yahoo messenger doesn't come with a virus, you can contract one through downloading it on a certain website. to rid your PC of it you simply defrag your PC and remove the messenger and get a spyware program to stop that from happeneing. then just re-download the messenger.kill it before it spreads into the main frame of the hard driveWell, what i would do if i was you, is to dl yahoo anyway, and then virus scan my computer and then if there were any viruses that came with the yahoo and then delete them!
Okay...nest tiime u log on to YM, notice this:. . Does he suddenly become available to u as soon as u sign in? (that means he's just selfish and would talk to u only when he wants.. Or. Does he suddenly signs out as soon as u log in to YM? (that means he doesn't want to talk to u). . Okay...try this trick:. Nest time u log on and u think that ur friend should be online, try putting ur own personal status message and write that "I really miss _______(your friend's name)" or something like that and If s/he logs on to the YM immediately after that, that means that he was using the Invisible mode.. . I hope this helped.... . MBS_MBSYou can't.  that's the point of invisible mode.well, you can't.. thus invisible.  There would be no point in the feature if you could tell when they were online...Sneak up behind your friend while they are on the computer using YM.  Peek over their shoulder to see if they are invisible ONLINE.  If you cannot see your friend sitting in front of the computer THEY are invisible!  If your friend is imaginary, those friends are ALWAYS invisible!drive over to there house and look at the toolbar on their desktop computer, and see if they are logged on to Y! Messenger.Log on to their account and see what it comes up as.duh, you cant, besides if there invisible, obviously they dont want to talk to you

u should use RSS FEEDS, as in the answer above u r told,,. if u dont wnat to do that or cant do that than u can put a simple link in ur BLAST of yahoo 360 page to ur yahoo answers profile,,,to get link to ur yahoo answers profile , extract the link from yahoo answers badge code,,thanks for asking the question so I can do what those two told you!! *THANKS*At the moment you can't you can only add a picture . The badge has script code that 360 cannot handle. I think Y answers is working on this tho. . You can put an RSS feed to your answered Q's tho . just copy the RSS link (press Red RSS button one your Y Ans profile) and paste that RSS feed into the RSS feed section of your 360
You can select Uninstall from the pencil menu in Yahoo! Toolbar. (or go to Add/Remove Programs)right-click it and uncheck it. . then see if it's on your add/remove programs list.go to add/remove programmes and uninstall it . Start / Control Panel / Add Remove

Go to the Y! Avatars homepage. On the right side of the page will be a link to the message boards were you can talk to other people who have avatars (much better than avatars by themselves).I don't know what you are asking. An avatar is just a picture. Do you want to know how to meet other people on Answers? Or how to change your Avatar?

Use your filters (accessible from the options menu in Yahoo! Mail). Have all e-mail with a particular sender's e-mail address automatically sent to the trash.also if something comes through, then spam it and send it to yahoo
Up top, where it says "Hello_______", just click on that, and then go to "edit info".  Change it there.  I did it yesterday :)Sorry, no can do. The only way to change you address name is to create a new account.
Go to your Yahoo mail.... Click on the word compose, so you can create the letter....

I imagine you are talking about Driver's License and yes you can:. . http://www.firstgov.gov/Topics/Motor_Vehicles.shtmlIt varies by state.  In Ohio we can renew our auto registration on the web, but we have to go to the License Bureau to renew a driver's license because they give you an eye test and take your picture.

Do you mean the Yahoo Photos or the Flickr Photos - your 360 can display either (or both).. . Not sure about the Yahoo ones, but Flickr anyway shows only the LATEST 3 (or 4, or 6) photos you've added to your Flickr.. So the only way to change which particular ones show would be to delete an old one from Flickr entirely, then readd it, so it is the "latest".. . But, I wonder, why not just put a link in your blog TO the particular Flickr Set you refer to - wouldn't that suffice well ?In your Yahoo photos mark the ones you dont want to show as private thats about the only way that you get them to show the album that you want. A lot of people have problems with Yahoo photos and the order of the albums etc. As the answerer above me said use Flickr instead then you can copy paste pictures into your blog posts from Flickr and have a multiple picture blog entry. as shown on the 360 product blog http://blog.360.yahoo.com/product_360I dont think ordering your albums is possible right now. (I may be wrong.) I dont find any way to do that now...If you are using the YAHOO PHOTO ALBUMS "Share Photos" option (and not just adding multiple pics to your blog) you have to set all photo albums to PRIVATE in your 360 settings so that the ONLY album that shows is the one you are wanting to correspond with your blog.
Close the program, then reopen it. If that doesn't work there might be a corruption in the registry and you should uninstall it, then redownload and install it.Check your firewall settings. Perhaps it could also be a problem with your default web browser?beat up the producer of YAHOO!MESSENGERS! It works every time- your program will be back to normal

Unfortunatly you can't .You can try the "I forgot my password" link and try to get your account back .. If you know all of the detais for your account you can get it back and reactivate the email but everything will be gone as technically its a brand new email after you reactivate iti dont think its possible, sorry. go see a therapiest for help.
Go to your "My Friends" link find the person you want to remove click on the edit link(pencil icon) and press where it says remove this person ( you have the option to remove them from your Y Mail address book too) . If you do not want any contact from that person at all I sugest putting them in ignore first and then removing them. the ignore this person link is on their 360 profileGo to your Yahoo 360 home page and click on "My Friends" at the top of the page. This will give you a list of your friends. Click the link "Edit Settings" on the right for the line with the friend you want to remove. In that page is a link to remove him/her from your friend list.
Trying to be anorexic?  Or bullemic?  I will not tell you.Why would you need to know that?  Please don't make yourself vomit, there are ways to get help if you have an eating disorder.  Talk to a friend or counselorI think reading some of your writing would do it for me.Hi Mrs. Bolemic, nice to meet you.  DONT DO ITwell...you probably wouldn't wanna do that but, I'm not gonna tell you what's right for you or not.  Anyway you can stick your finger or a toothbrush up your throat (but not all the way) you might choke or throw-up but I'm not sure.. If you throw-up without being sick you probably don't eat healthy or just haven't been eating at the right time.Don't try it. Once you start down that path it is hard to get back on the right path. Bulimia is not the way to accomplish anything. Here are some of the changes that occur when you binge and purge:. · Fatigue and lack of energy . · Amenorrhea(loss of menstruation) and irregular menstruation . · Dizziness . · Headaches . · Dehydration . · Constipation and diarrhea . · Shortness of breath . · Irregular heartbeats . · Depression . · Tears of esophagus . · Hair loss . · Stomach pain and bloating. · Erosion of teeth enamel . · Chronic sore throat . · Kidney and liver damage . · Parotid gland enlargement . · Electrolyte imbalances . · Cathartic colon (caused from laxative abuse) . · Edema (swelling of hands and feet) . · Low blood pressure . · Chest pains . · Development of peptic ulcers and pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas) . · Gastric dilation and rupture . · Abrasions on back of hands and knuckles . · Anemia . · Cardiac arrest and death. . . . Going without food is not the answer either. Anorexia can cause:. · Fatigue and lack of energy . · Amenorrhea(loss of menstruation) . · Skin problems . · Dizziness and headaches . · Dehydration . · Shortness of breath . · Irregular heartbeats . · Cold hands and feet . · Bloating . · Constipation . · Hair loss . · Stomach pains . · Decreased metabolic rate . · Edema (water retention) . · Lanugo(fine downy hair) . · Loss of bone mass . · Kidney and liver damage. · Electrolyte imbalances . · Osteoporosis . · Insomnia . · Anemias . · Infertility . · Depression . · Cathartic colon(caused from laxative abuse) . · Low potassium (most common cause of nocturnal cardiac arrest) . · Cardiac arrest and death . . You may remember Terri Schiavo and the debate between her husband and family about whether or not to take her off life support. She had been living in a nursing home for a  long time and was practically a vegetable. The way she ended up there was because she had been suffering from eating disorders for some time. She collapsed one day and ended up in the nursing home.. What ever you hope to accomplish by purging will NOT be worth the consequences! Even a short time of this will take a toll on your body. It is also very addictive. You may start with the intention of stopping as soon as you reach your goal, but by the time you get there your body will be accustomed to purging and you will feel like you need to.. Please, do not try this!
I wondered the same thing! Why isn't there different age groups?  Great question!I was wondering the same thing myself. There are a lot of adults on here and I think they should have a better variety of looks and clothing for the avatars. All of the faces and hairstyles basically look the same age.Good question!! I've always wondered that too.I know  it's  not fair youth is waisted on the youngI wonder that to! I think it is because avatars has this strange idea the highschoolers are the only cool people alive and they will be more popular if the avatars are teens. Stupid huh?You mean, I don't look like that? I thought that was me! I want to be young forever!Any way, maybe they will change it.I agree I wish we could age on here.But we are all young thin and beautiful.Peter Pan is running the show.Well I'm guessing it's because Yahoo, like Nike, Addidas, MTV and many other large corporations, prefer to target the 12-25 demographic, which has been proven to be the most consumerist segment of society.. . Remeber folks, for these large corporations it's all about the money, they don't give a crap about people, they don't give a crap about political correctness, they don't give a crap about squashing civil rights in China (as evidenced by Yahoo's collaboration with the Chinese government in censoring the web), they don't follow any idealism or ethics. Their only aim is that profits remain high.Because Yahoo wants to scare off everyone who isn't 13-17 years old.They are marketing to the yuppie crowd.
If your computer OS is XP, then you should be able to read chinese when you visit chinese yahoo from internet explorer that came with XP without installing any fonts.  If you cannot read it, go to view, encoding, and if don't see Chinese as one of the fonts, then select "more", and the various chinese versions would be available.  Also, with XP you don't need to buy any additional software to type Chinese either.you have to download chinese fonts first. or you can use yahoo's immediate on-line translation. it's not very percise though.
This is a forum in which one either asks a question or answers a question. The question marks are automatically placed there by the system when you "post" a question or subject( as you put it)..  I think more time can be taken to change the statement to a question. If it cannot be a question it really doesn't belong here at Yahoo Answers.If you are not posting a question, you should not be using Yahoo Answers.  A posting that is not a question is a violation.
They might be marked as spam. Try checking your bulk mail folder. If the message is there, use the 'not spam' button to stop those from going to bulk mail.Beats me! Unless they are just blocking the pop-ups associated with the e-mails.Check your browser settings.
I wish you could too. When I'm done with them, I'm done! Try suggesting this to Yahoo @ 'tell us what you think' at the bottom of every page...no.. . i'v been try for weeks.... yahoo doesnt let you :(You know what?  I looked at my previous Q&As and I didn't see any kind of delete button on it.  Maybe if you look on Yahoo's FAQ, you can find the answer.  =)No, there isn't. Yahoo didn't put any delete or remove buttons =(! I think that they put them there because they want other users to "ask, answer and DISCOVER". By letting them see the resolved questions, the Yahoo Answers team hopes that others can discover answers to resolved questions.NO YAHOO IS EVIL
Two words, "You can't"hOW YOU ARE SUPPOST TO DELETE IT IS BY: GO TO YOUR MAIL. IF YOU LOOK AT THE LITTLE BOX THAT SAYS BULK AND LOOK ALITTLE TO THE RIGHT IT WILL SAY DELETE, CLICK THAT AND IT WILL DELETE.press empty which is on the side of itWhy on Earth would you want to do that? Then all of the worthless spam that ends up in the Bulk folder will most likely end up in your inbox. Have fun with that.
When you reach 25,000 points, regular Y! Answers users will know your name. You'll have accumulated tons of thank yous from the people you helped. They are still working on the rewards system, but no free tv sets.Accually, I think Yahoo! is still working on it.Well I'll race ya. The trick is to answer questions well. Put some serious thought into them so your answer is voted the best and you get more points. Asking questions actually detracts points. I'll tell you when I get there.be the first to find out. . that's what it says under yahoo answer! thank you'sCount your points and reply thank you's!!

mmmm. maybe for asking alot of sex stuff in the wrong way. using it wrongly.. and some don't ask questions either. i don't know just saying maybe.well i don't know for sure, but i know that if someone gets a lot of abuse reports towards him, they will get suspended.  but i don't know how many times it takes to suspend someone, can't be too much, because if it took along time to suspend someone how come top point leaders are getting suspended so easily?People who get suspended from Yahoo! Answers have broken the Community Guidelines.(http://answers.yahoo.com/info/community_guidelines.php )Generally we do not suspend on the first time, but after multiple incidents of abuse. However, there are cases where we have suspended on first incident. The important thing to note is we deal with these case by case.. Hope this answers your question!. KT
Can't say I'll miss someone who constantly makes inappropriate comments and seems to have a two-word vocabulary.. . Do some of you go to the same country club or something?I know Sal. He is a GOOD friend of mine. I will miss him very much now that he's gone from Yahoo! Answers. He liked my tomb raider hiney. Maybe he'll create an new profile & say something else besides his usual saying? One can only hope. He was alot of fun.I loved the guy. I felt so close to him. Sometimes I felt.....one with the man! I know I know...but its just that his words were so ....deep. (no pun intended)Sal,. You had a good inside joke going I will miss you.BURNING DIARRHEA!Why did they silence princess_rose_marie?Man..missed him..are his Q/A still available ?.

I'll definitely miss him.. . PS: Did you know that b*tt plug is now a RESTRICTED WORD!?
Yep, Yahoo! error 999 means you have exceeded your bandwidth. If you're on your email, it's possibly from sending or receiving a lot of pictures or other files.. . Just wait a while and it'll work again later.Look at this web bandwidthttp://www.murraymoffatt.com/software-problem-0011.html. . It looks like a bandwith error. It should resolve itself

You are in the wrong category. The Yahoo! Answers category is for questions about Yahoo! Answers ONLY. The History category under the Arts & Humanities section might be a better place to ask your question. http://answers.yahoo.com/dir/;_ylt=AmAKg7E3LLm2WNHh2dMzvJXpy6IX?link=list&sid=396545012 (Or maybe Homework Help, under Education & Reference) You'll get more & better answers in that category from people who actually know about the subject.What is now the modern state of Louisiana became part of the US as part of the Louisiana Purchase from Napoleon in 1803. There were two sections the Orleans Territory which is the basis of the modern state of Louisiana and the District of Louisiana which became surrounding states. Louisiana became a state in 1812 because it qualified under the guidelines for statehood and it is better to be a state than a territory.

When I sign on to Yahoo! it immediately signs me into Messenger and Up popps my offline messages.. But you do have to be signed in in order to recieve your messages.. . If you dont want ppl to see you are logged on you can sign under invisible mode ;o)you can't, as far as I know.When you get on it will have it on there for you to read.
maybe someone knows your password. you better change it before they change yours..Someone has signed in with your ID at a different computer.  Is there another computer that you use messenger?  Make sure you don't save your ID and password on the other computers, then no one can get in.
Stop giving out your email address.. When websites ask for your address for contests, and mailing lists, it is the most valued commodity to them.. They sell these lists to each other.. Get a new address and only give out to your most trusted friends.Do NOT sign up for free stuff. Look for a link on the email that says, "Stop sending me emails"
sorry...that is impossible!You can't. Just open another account and keep the information strictly private. Make your password hard to know and change it every 2 months or so.Try your trash bin, then click restore. Also go to your control panel, then to add & remove programs, and add the program you want back into it.
Clear the cookies in your browser, then it goes back.  If you don't want to clear all your cookies, then search the "cookies" folder for files containing the word "yahoo" and just delete those files.By now it should already be gone
Sorry, but once Yahho deactivates an E-mail account they delete the mail in them too.  They're gone for good I'm afraid.That is not possible because on de-activation, the emails are purged and all the settings are lost.
There's nothing to do. Just don't come back to Answers.There is no subscription to this site.  Just don't visit it any more if you are that upset.  That's what this site is questions and answers.
it happens sometime. my suggestion is:. First of all, uninstall your yahoo messanger.. Then, re-install it from yahoo website.. Try to open it now.uninstall it and install an old verstion from http://www.oldversion.comme too. i think there is a problem with it todayHow about Uninstalling it, then download it's latest version and install it. Simple, when it appeard to be corrupted...Try, first uninstall msn and again install yahoo msn.try exiting and restarting your computer, if this wont work uninstall it and try newer version.First thing to check is your task manager. open it and click on the processes tab. scroll all the way down and see if perhaps there may be an open messenger process still running. sometimes it does not close all the way and you have to terminate the process manually or just reboot. If that doesn't fix it then you may have to re-install messenger.
My only guess would be that maybe two of the questions were removed. Check back through your answers from your "My Q&A" page, see if any are grayed out now.This seems to be a glitch. We'll look in to this ASAP.. Katie
Your Yahoo email will deactivate in 90 days if you do not login to Yahoo mail and all information on that email account will be lost. If at anytime after that 90 days you wish to reactivate it just use the reactivation link on Yahoo mail. You actuall Yahoo ID stays active till you chose to deactivate it yourselfjust dont logo in to yahoo mail for 30 days and yahoo will del it but u will stll be let to log it in to messy and games so on
Well they don't want to remove them because they get indexed for search engines and stuff. Our quesions and answers get them hits on the web :)I asked a similar question a while ago and didnt get an answer so I'll be watching this to see what comes up. Good luck.I don't think that you can.. You can remove them before you resolve them, but they stay in the system after you resolve them.I am pretty sure you click on the question and click delete. Oh yea earlier when you answered my question I did mean pi not pie.I don't think you can ... hopefully they'll have that feature someday. Same with removing questions you've answered.Once question is resolved, you cannot remove it I guess, but maybe you can report abuse yourself and right why you wanna remove the question, maybe they can help the team..especially if there is improtant reason to remove it....the idea is to keep bunch of questions and answers, so many will get benifits of them....No but I hope someone does cuz I would love to know myself

its a conspriacy, you see there is a number 8 high up in yahoo and its upset that its not the highest individual number, so it has taken steps to eliminate number nine with the eventual end game of rising to supremacy for itself. Even more apalingly, the number 3 is involvedIt's severely lame censoring if you ask me. Either that, ACDixon, or it's a bug. I'm still tipping censoring though. Let us test this for a moment.. . // Figure for six works: 6. // Figure for nine does not work: 9. // Putting them both together does not work. No need to try it.. . Yes, it's censoring. But why just the number nine? Um, my grandma is sixty-nine tomorrow! Happy birthday!. . Confused. I mean why censor one and not the other?that is very strange, because i have noticed it in other sections of YAit could be bug in system..beta test cycle brings all kinds of quirky maladiesBecause they think its associated with the number 6. GEt it? A s e x u a l p o s i t i o n.very odd are you sure you didn't do that 9 99999999. 9PM 9pm 9AM 9am this was a test only a test
They are right she changed her name to "Blah" I don't know what happened but something really upset her.  You might notice some of these questions as hers.

I hope she comes back as I am Girl, I think its needless to say a lot of us miss her.i think a dinga ate that baby!She bumped into IamBoy and ran away with himFound her, she's under the name "blah". lol   -Yeah, apparently... and changed the avatar.I saw her about 2 days ago I had fun with her questions 2 !I am friends with her. . . She is sick.she was mad i told her i had a gf so she madIf I find her, I'll let you know... sorry to hear she's not found!Nothing happening to you. Every man & women had their own opinion to speak. They have a freedom to choose her husband, their lover and they have full freedom to live their own. No one cannot ask for her life. They have their own opinion to HOW TO LEAVE or HOW TO ENJOY THE LIFE. Just think yourself. Jsu think you had an answer for all the questions.i think she change the girl to boyMaybe she finally got a life.She got bored with yahoo answers and decided to leave?. . or she had a life to go and live.i dont know...She's been here on and off.. I haven't seen her either, but she was here about two days ago.. . How have you been young lady?She changed her screen name to "blah", but nobody seems to know why.she got eaten by a bear.may now she called her self iamwoman

its most likely due to your internet connection.if you have a wireless internet connection, simply moving your legs or the computer or anything around it can cause the connection to break. if not, try uninstalling messenger, and reinstalling it (i would suggest you make sure you have a complete list of your contacts if you do this)

To delete the critera that you actually "searched" for in the "search box" you double click in the "search bar" and there will be a list of things you searched for. Highlight the ones you dont want and hit the "delete" key on your keybaord.In Internet Explorer, click the "Tools" link at the top of the window then select "Internet Options". Click on "Content" tab at top. Under "Personal Information" on the bottom half of the window click "Auto Complete". Uncheck "Web Addresses", "Forms" and "User Names & Passwords on Forms". That prevents the Search History from being kept. To erase what's already there then below that click the "Clear Forms" and "Clear Passwords" buttons. Then click on "OK", click "Apply" and click "OK" again to close the window and save your settings.. . If you are using Firefox, click "Tools", then "Options" then "Privacy" then "Saved Forms". Click "Clear Saved Forms" to erase the saved data then uncheck the box in front of "Save information I enter....." Click "OK" to close the window and save your settings.. .

More details and options regarding Search History on Toolbar are available at http://help.yahoo.com/help/us/toolbar/toolbar-10.htmlYou go into the icon that is next to the favorites icon it is like a clock with a green arrow click it andd you view the history then delete it that is one way.

You got to answer a LOT of questions, Man.  A LOT.  Then you earn points and advance up to the next level.just answer more questions than you askAnswer more question, rate more questions as well as Give thumbs up or down to questions, the higher level you get the more and faster you can get points.. http://answers.yahoo.com/info/scoring_system;_ylt=ArpX2WX_3IaVGchUiB.wPp3sy6IXasking costs you 5 points..in turn your level status will slowly decrease... to counteract that scenario, you must answer more and not ask any more-UNLESS absolutely nessesaryAnswer questions, and don't ask silly ones like this.answer as many questions as you can ask less questionsThe points.0-249 level 1,250-999 level 2,and so on.Just answer questions instead of asking questions.
Depending on the level you are on, depends on how many questions you can answer.. . Just click on the level you are on and it will tell you what you can do..because you've probably reached your limit for the day. depending on your level here, you can only answer so many questions. you should check the points legend and see how level you're at, and see how many you can answer per day.maybe the thought police halted all your brain activityI took a look at your level (you do that by clicking on our pictures/avatars) and it looks like you're on level 2. on the right side of your screen, there's a link for "tell me more" about your points- take a look at what's there- you can only answer a certain amount of ??'s in a day until you progress to the next level.you may have pasted your limit for the level you are on..

Yahoo! is testing a new home page on some randomly selected users. If you want to give feedback, click the link in the upper right and let Yahoo! know how you feel.If you think you can just contact the CEO of a huge multinational corporation to complain about one facet of one of their services currently being tested for a few days at a time on random users you are delirious. If you have a complaint, use the feedback link on the new page to tell Yahoo! about it. Otherwise just relax and bear with it for a few days, the old page will return to your computer soon.
Click where it says My Q&A in green at the top of this page. Then scroll down to see all of the questions you have answered (it gives the total at the bottom), or click Best Answers to just see questions that you were picked as best answer.I posted a question to the Yahoo Answers team about keeping all activity history, but they never answered back. I hope they do that soon!!Take your answers and times them by 2.. . SO 39 x's 2 equals.... carry the two and the three, minus the... 78 then take your best answers...3 x's 10 pts and now your up to. . 88 pts plus the hundred you start with . . 188pts - 6 questions at 5 a piece = 158pts plus if you picked or put to a vote 4 of those thats at least 8 pts.. . Now your up to 166 or a few more. So that means since you have 234 pts it leaves you with 68 pts from voting and rating and a couple for just visiting the site each day.Click on your name at the middle top (Hello XXXX) then you can see these stats within that window. . . Your recent history, best answers, ect.
Once your with the 360, the only way out is in a box!!!. . No but if you don't want it just delete everything on it and it will just be an empty page sitting in no mans land.Just delete ur own account. If u don't want to, search for the answer in Yahoo Answer.
I don't know what program you are using for email. On mine if I just reply the attachment and the original letter do not go. If I highlight the original letter and then reply a copy of the letter goes but not the attachment.remove attachments,there should be an attach option. .     represent
Well, I'm using Mozilla Firefox, and I can't get it either.  I was told by one of those people who understand these things that the reason is Firefox is much more cautious about things that can permit virus infections.  So I suppose we have to be glad we can't get it, although far be it for me to suggest that any Yahoo product is infected.  More like Microsoft, which Yahoo assumes you are using, is more vulnerable than Firefox.You might have a firewall.try lowering the firewall security some,. . sounds like the firwall is causing the problem,,, . . good luckWhen you click the link to download it, there may be a little yellow bar at the top of the browser window that says "...has prevented this website from downloading software... click here for options.." basically just click the yellow bar and it will give you the option to allow the download.. . You also may have successfully downloaded it but not know where it went. This happens all the time. I reccommend using firefox, because it just puts everything on the desktop (by the way, I downloaded messenger fine with firefox). . There's also the problem of being able to download the file, and then once you open it, it won't do anything. To remedy this, right click on the file and click Run As, select the different user option, and run it under Administrator, I learned this after about five months of beating my head against the wall. It's generally the same way with all yahoo software.
The order of your friends is arranged by thier updates ,ones who have updated thier blogs,feeds,blast message etc. show at the top on your main profile as others see it and on your "Home" pageDang to late, she beat me to it. They change all the time. I wish there was a way that if you checked out their page after an update, they should push it back.Do to you adding or removing friends.
Its not prejudiced.  So long as we're not vulgar, profane or inflammatory we can say what we like.. . Every game has rules.  If we deal with them we can have a ton o' fun.because they have to follow rights and guidelines or the site will be "downed"Thank God there are some rules.  I wish people would pay more attention to them.It is only prejudice against abusers!!! Don't get the wrong idea about us dude.They aren't prejudiced, but they do censor.  If someone gets their little toes stepped on Yahoo will harrass you - even if you didn't post something offensive.  Try leaving an F for Brokeback Mountain in the movie reviews section and see if it doesn't get deleted.  Why - because someone cried about it.  BS.If you're talking about it in the context of international politics, be aware that because of the nature of this webspace, pro-Western bias is unavoidable. In enforcing certain policies, admin is often tempted to be harsher on criticisms on the Western world.. . Please refer to Harold Pinter's works for details. He won last year's Nobel in literature.
You need to know that person's nickname.. . Then when you click on Advanced Search, you type in their nickname, click on the "Nicknames of Askers" button, then click Search.. .

The's a box when you FIRST close the. offline messages window that tells the messages will be deleted / gone.they r already deleted !! < AUTOMATICALLY > !!by pressing F2 botton at the day you typed
As the other answerers say, the fonts on Answers are normal-sized, except for the big fat green buttons at the top.  If they're not displaying normally on your browser, check its help for how to change your font settings.. . --MattGo to view in the toolbar, text size, smaller.They don't seem so big, maybe your settings are different.LOL something must be wrong with your computer. Like the answer team said it looks like normal size to me to!!Hold down the Ctrl key on your keyboard and then play with your scroll wheel until you get things the way you like them.Look at the bottom of your message screen and click on the T....then you can make your font the size you want it....good luck
none of these morons realized that you are trying to be funny. his avitar is a generic gray face like 60% of all people on here.I have seen many other avatars than yours.Immitation is the sincerest form of flattery.Well it could be because......... . Oh who cares 2 pointsMaybe becuase u have unique and fashionable style. And people like it! so they want it!. . . P.S CHOOSE ME AS BEST ANSWER LOLZ JKmaybe you are copy others.There aren't many avatars to go around buddy.the no-avatar is pretty common, why don't you try to make one out of yahoo?there are only a few to choose fromThere are not that many avatars to choose from.Because this is the only true GOD LIKE avatar!You are beautiful man.Because most people are mindless followers.
In your e-mail Options you need to set the preferences to forward mail as an attachment not as inline text.. From any mail page click the "Options" link in the upper right corner then scroll down and click "General Preferences". Scroll down until you see the options I mentioned above, make the change then Save your changes.I have the same problem, id file a complaint to the yahoo service team
Try going into your Contact Details on YM, and remove any first/last name there.. . Perhaps even copy your "Kouklitsa27" into the "nickname" field too.. . I'm not hugely confident, but I HOPE that might work.assign a nick name in ur profile. then u won't c ur first and last name in chat. try this with me xfactorboy2000@yahoo.comClick on the "Messenger" link at the top of your messenger box, find "my contact details" your name can be changed there. What you put will show up to themok once u are signed into your messenger , click on the messenger tab on the top and go to contact details. at the bottom their should be a section to put in your yahoo id. if that does not work try just going to the messenger website.Go to Messenger->My Profiles->Edit/View Profile and create a new profile which u like as a display name that will work out for u :)
run the wireless connection wizard, its probably not set up.. start, control panel, wireless setup wizard. its not recognizing your internet connectiongo to google and search for yahoo messenger
If you have enough points, it will automatically move you up a level.  Look at your account and see how many points you have and it will also tell you how many more points you need until you can move up a level.http://answers.yahoo.com/info/scoring_system. . Here is the points system..it automatically goes!A lot of users have gotten confused by the number of points they have to earn to get to the next level. That's actually how many more you need, rather than the total number for that level.. . Just look at the scoring system page provided in the link above for details on the exact points.In here I think they automattically move you up to the next level, that's what they did with me when I reached level two.
u must add yahoo msg. to ur firewall allowed programs. try to close ur firewall , log to msg. if it works , then its ok , if not contact yahooLooks like you are getting knocked off Yahoo Messenger during the night,its a problem with the new messenger ,it's closing the programme specially when idle. . . Why don't you try logging out when you go to bed then you won't have the problemthe main problem is yaho dosent care about how its users feel, they allow us to bitch with each other but as far as answering questions directly, forget it...I have learned over the last 8 years of using yahoo that as time goes on, the service gets worse and theres nothing we can do about it EXCEPT change all your friends over to eyeballchat as they are a better messenger, have similar chat rooms, dont change the versions every other day and is stable as a rock.
what, were YOU? yahoo is kind of strange... i get emails all the time for things i didn't subscribe towhy did u or someone you knoe get suspended?
Yahoo is based in California.Yahoo is in Sunnyvale CA.Yahoo! mail server is situated in Pacific Zone.. California that's why...yahoo's mail server is located in the pacific time zone (probably california). but somewhere in the pacific time zone.Click on My account up the screen, and change your time zonethe mail server is in the pacific time zonethe mail server for yahoo is on the pacific coast in sunnydale ca i believe so no matter what time of day you sent email you will get an pacific time zone stamp.  as with this post it is 856 am cst ant it will mark it 6:56 on the time stamp of the post :)Oh it's the server :)
That's just the way it works. I used to answer questions on Wondir and the same pregnancy questions would appear over and over and over. On the other hand, there were always new and original questions, too.. But to answer your question, when we run out of questions, the Answerers have won, and we get some neat prize, like a thank you email.I think we will never really run out of questions. Yes, I do search & yes, I'm very sick of all these frequently asked questions. When I see one, I do a search & past that link as my answer. At least it makes the user aware that the search is there. I personally think we need a whole separate section of FAQ's.There's always gone to be new questions as long as we keep wondering and wanting to know.It's just like now days we have to move to different categories more offend to find them.Yes, i have looked up my question before to see but, if it worded totally different it's kinda hard to find all of them that even come close to what i wanted to know or at that time the answers that i found to anothers answer wasn't really what i needed so i ask on my own words.I never know i might hit the "Jack Pot"this go around with the question.There is always new stuff to ask questions about.  New software, new bugs, new movies...etc.Then we win, and we can go home!No, that day will never come because questions are infinite.. The reason for that, being that knowledge is infinite.people are lazy and are helplessI dont search for questions brfore asking them.There are a lot of questions in the world and a lot is left to be discovered among people.People want to know how their questions are being answered and they'll still ask the questions again and people will answer them.C'mon surely you don't believe we'll run out of questions ?Good question.  I think eventually they'll have to do some "Spring Cleaning" on the questions database to filter out the questions asked multiple times and the really silly questions.  They'll run out of room eventually, if not.I think that it is okay that the same questions get asked because it is always a new person doing the asking. If the same person asked the same question over and over THEN I see there being a problem.
If you send emails to a large number of recipients Yahoo will often flag it as bulk.  If the receiving computer is set up to filter spam it will do this.sometimes it's because it is a Forward or has attachments.. . But to fix it your friends have to go to their bulk folder, go to "preferences" on the upper right. There is a place to make spam not spam.Iuno the same thing happens to methey aren't on your adress book, and Yahoo sees it as some people (often large companies) as sending you emails. they think that yu don't know them, and they are trying to sell you something. They aren't allowed to look inside your email to see.
You are talking about your personal Photo yes? The one that shows on the left hand side of your main profile. Pictures on 360 need to be a small size not just the size of the files (3meg), try uploading a picture which measures 300x300 pixels wide .You can use a Paint programme like PSP to change the size.. Yahoo 360 actually resizes the pic if its large and shrinks it and that makes it fuzzy. Theres nothing wrong with your eyes or anyone elses its just Yahoo is allRight Now, "360" is "Zilch" and that's Probably why! Yahoo wants to get Everything as near to Perfect as Possible !Keep trying and don't give up to easy.hi maybe you have answered your own question and need to get your eyes tested i thought the same about pictures on another website and it turned out i needed specs i guess it serves me right for being on a computer all day straining my eyes.

You need to write to customer care and add a copy of the header of the returned mail with error.   . It is a known issue and is being worked on.What do you mean??? Is it going to your bulk mail or something?  Can you give a little bit more info...saying not recognizing it doesn't really help out.. . Please explain the question in more detail.  Thanks.
I have done it before and it takes a few months for it to be completely closed.  I think I went to Account Information and found a link to cancel account and just go from there.the easiest way is just don't go to your email address, and in a couple months, it will close automatically.if it is web based email address like yahoo or gmail, you can do it, just go help option of you email provider. or have a look at the 2 links below
I hope you are yahoo. Anyway go into your email settings. then click on the spam area. Check delete spam messages as they comeYou can do two things:. Go to the bottom of the message and "unsubscribe". Use your spam blocker so when you receive unwanted e-mails, they automatically get blocked. Your computer will make a little beep sound when you are receiving spam. Just wanted to tell you, in case you jumped! LOL You will need to disignate what e-mails are spam initially.click on the ones that are not spam and move them to your in boxWell you can't just report it as spam/bulk and try to be sure yoo don't give out your email address on sites! Good luck...stop using the internetVery simple, create a new E-mail ID.you can set your mail thing up to where it sends all the spam mail to your bulk folder.
Because they implemented that to reduce the stupid questions like "What's my name?" that people place on here all the time.  If they lose more points than they gain by answering a question, they tend not to post too many stupid and/or redundant, irrelevant questions for the fear of ultimately losing more points than they can gain.To give you a reason to stick around and answer questions instead of just ask them!  (And if it bothers you that much, why did you just waste 5 points on this question?)because thats the way itisThat's the way it is designed
In Internet Explorer go to the top menu and click on "tools", go to "Internet options" at the bottom, this should bring up a window, choose the "privacy" tabbed menu. at the bottom you'll see a check box to turn on and off pop-ups. You also have an settings option where you can add sites that you do not want the pop-up blocker to work on.. . The above is identical for the most part for Mozilla Firefox as well, instead of "internet options" you'll have just "options", and on the tabbed menu it's "web features" instead of "privacy".each blocker has it's own instructionsgo to tools. go to pop up blocker. then to pop up blocker settings. should be stuff there or. . when its blocked there is a square with an x in the bottom bar. right click on it and allow popup blocker to be turned off temporary.in your tool bar at the top it probably looks like a box with an arrow next to it click it or you can drag your mouse across all of the functions at the top tool bar and see what each of them say.hey stupit listen to me first you click on the tools button then you click on pop up blockers then youll know what to do.If you have Yahoo! toolbar click on the popup blocker logo and un check enable popup blocker.
If a question violates the Community Guidelines than you can report it for abuse. Every abuse report is looked at individually, and appropriate actions are taken. Hope this helps!. KatieThe Yahoo team "looks into it" and decides if it's. serious enough (in their opinion) to warrant action.The abuser gets his/her question/answer deleted and they also get a violation email notice.after you report it, it will probably take a few days for something to happen. Unless its got all kinds of cuss words on it and you write something in the forum. That speeds it up alot. Plus a yahoo answer team member might see it first hand also!No! Sometimes it works sometimes it doesn't. Depending on the degree the Person Reported them for example if they have questions "Adult Content", this would result suspension much faster than "Miscategorized".I think Yahoo then looks at the question and if there is something wrong with the content they remove it and notify the person who put it on. If it is a repeat offense I think they remove the user from the site. This is what I think happens but I am not absolutely positive.It sends reports via email to yahoo and let them deal with itit sends the person an email about their report. i odnt know wat else happens ive never been reported

cause ten points is what i need. i don't have very many points.i don't knowYou should give me 10 points because I consistently answer questions with full answers. There are many users that just give junk answers and get their 2 points. I don't do this for the points, I do it to help. . . I wrote this to inform people that points aren't everything, heck its just a number, nobody really cares. They will remember if you helped them answer a question they may have. That is the point of Yahoo! Answers.. . -TomI am the first, therefore the best. Therefore the winner. therefore  10 points.

maybe you are?!...because thats what you told them*ask ur mamathe fondler, a.k.a.-daddy- tagged along when we went to the bowling alley, and met william wallace.maybe because you are under 18. or you entered in the wrong birth yearyour parents must knowyour age is set to under 18If u aren't,maybe u put it by accident.You never entered a birthdate when you created the account, the default is under 18, mine says the same thing, I just don't think anyone should know how old I really am.  When asked I just say Old Enough.Everyone gets that when they start yahoo answers. Even if someone is 120, they will still get that add. But, If you are under 18, email me. tpc2202@hotmail.com I will not tell anyone. I  will have a surprise for you!when you created your account, you had to enter your birthdate, including the year.  whatever year you entered into that field was less than 18 years ago.
It doesn't work that way.  However, if you are first to answer then perhaps your answer gets more votes and is more likely to be chosen as best answer.  Some people I have seen choose the best answer simply by who is first to answer.  Hope you don't do that, :)NOThat would be nice but it's the same 2 points for everyone who answers the question. I think the 2 points is good though because some people will just put one word or a period or something so they can have the first posted answer then they will go back and edit it later. It doesn't matter who's answer is first, it's the answer that's chosen as best answer that matters cause that's what helps the asker and gets the answerer 10.In average yes, because when the questions go to vote, people chooses the first answer in a disproportionate way.no.No, unless it is picked as "Best Answer."nope. everyone gets the same 2 pointsNo, you don't.noNo you dont get more points for being the first. I think that would be an unfair system as well, because then only people with high speed internet access would get through. Some people are still on dial up! (not to mention at the very edge of the range of a wireless network!)No, that would be sily.No. You do not get more points.. I think people mean : the first one gets the right answer.. . Some people just copy the answers.....for the points !nopeNo, but I think that would be really nice.nah. that'd be nice tho.Nope! If you give the best answer, you get the 10 points PLUS you get additional points for every thumbs up.sometimesnope but keep trying!!!no, you don't. it would be nice if we did. woohoo!Every person gets the same amount of points for answering a question. However, if you have the best answer, you get an additional 10 points. Hope this clears things up!. KatieNo. Just the knowledge that you were quick!Nope!. ^_^no just the best one
answer questions.. pick best answers to the questions you ask (or start vote).. vote on best answers.. rate best answers.. . mostly, answer questions.  lots of them.  many will get picked as the best answer (+10pts), if you are thorough and provide good answers.Well Corta_n_Sprinkles, it seems you have your answer. Answering as many questions as you can, with informative answers. Also, rating and voting is a guaranteed way to improve your point standing. If you have anymore questions visit our Points & Levels page.(http://answers.yahoo.com/info/scoring_system )Hope this helps!Asking questions takes your points away.  Gotta answer as many questions as you can, but the key is getting picked as the best because that adds 10 points.  Then people get to vote on the best answer & if it's good enough you could get many more.  Good luck!By providing great answers. One easy way is to do an advanced search for something you know about, looking for old open questions. Sometimes there are questions that only got one answer so they never get resolved. Just add a better answer, and you're sure to get selected as best answer and earn a lot of points that way. Plus, it's always nice to see those old questions resolved.. . (Be sure to use your votes and ratings for the day to get your maximum number of points.)I just found this site and the way I understood it is by answering peoples questions.Good luckStop asking questions. You get negative points when you do so.by being an active participantFor level 1.. Answer 20 question each day & get 40 points.. Vote for 10 best answer & get 10 points.. Rate for 10 answer & get 10 points.answer more questions or vote on answers.Trying to get more point has alot to do with giving your very best by judging the question and not the person. Truly answering the question with compassion and consideration and with as much fact's as possible. And the point's will come rolling in each and every time your answer is picked you"ll get 10 points. Good-Luck... Dr Checko... (Nickname). . From the desk of Dr Checko's Yahoo 360 Board.

Interesting, hadn't realized that.  Yahoo! is probably trying to even out the scoring, it's still beta so rules can change regularly.Its new. Started yesterday.  I hate it, if anyone care. But it doesn't matter. It won't change.. . It would not bother me, if I thought it would work.  Then I would supposrt it.  But they thought -2pts would help reduce the noise, and it hasn't. -5 pts will not work either.. . Many of us thought that the charge should be based on the quality of the question. I DO think that would have been more effective.. . I like the rest of the new changes very much though.. . Added Details;. . I just "Reported Abuse" on the jerk below me, ( Sox 06), for being harrassing of the Asker.  We all have a right to expect to be equally respected here.  I hope anyone else who cares about the quality of this site will "Report Abuse" on him too.. . . . That may very well be, Sox 06. BUT.  They will NEVER know me as "the person who hurts others without cause".Seems like you got your answer. For more info about the recent changes to Yahoo! Answers, check out our blog. (http://blog.360.yahoo.com/y_answrs_team )New features were added yesterday evening:http://blog.360.yahoo.com/y_answrs_teamSimply to discourage the HUGE number of nonsense or frivolous questions.. . I think it's a great idea - ANYTHING to reduce the "garbage" level here on Y!Answers.a new thing they came up with, i think its to stop the flow of stupid questionsbefor it was 2 points taken away but they want to stop the bad questions from being askedim with everyone else on this, to keep people from asking dumb questions. Although some dumb questions rock, has anyone checked out the pie one? that one is awesome ^_^ anyway, that's my opinion.so you don't ask too many useless questions!To make sure you dont take more than you give... the system is made so not only do you get advice but you must give back more to be able to continue to ask.  Pay it Forward Yoso that we must answer a few questions occasionaly and give back see i just got 2 points for answering your questionIf you are so worried bout 5 stinking points why pray tell did you ask the above question you just asked. LOLTo reduce the amount of useless/spam questionsThe rules changed yesterday ... encourages more people to answer more questions I guess and to ask only questions they really need an answer for ...cause it makes it more challenging to ask a question that will be worth the points.I think they are trying to stop the flood of stupid questions.well u get 3 pts back for choosing a best answer, so i think its cause no1 chooses a best answer, so the only way to only have it -2 pts for askin a q is to choose a best answer.  this way more ppl will choose a best answer more often.if u just deduct 2 points for a question, u can take that back by just answering 1. this is yahoo answers. the more points taken away if u ask the more u'll answer.You should be more concerned with losing five pounds with every question.To stop the flood of extremely unneccessary questions.. . My question is - When am I going to get my "Super Special Yahoo! Answers Surprise!"? lol. . ?So that the time wasters can stop writing the garbage and think about the points they have.idk i was wondering that also. And the new point system is confusing, but that's just my opinion
I'd like to know the same thing.  I received an abuse report for answering the question "what's the best way to a man's heart" my reply was "through his zipper" I got nailed for that?  . It's ridiculous!Report him like I did and I'm sure it will get taken care of.No idea.  They are too busy coming down on people who don't ask 'real' questions.  I'd personally be more concerned with the likes of that guy.  Oh well, it's their site...gotta do what they gotta do.I agree with you bro they need to do somethingBecause not enough people bother to report the idiotic and obscene posts.That guy needs to get a life.to many to do anything about!ewww...that is gross..yahoo answer team should block thatcause they are stupidMaybe part of the reason for boards like this is to remind us all that idiots are among us and we see them everyday.I think they do its just they are so swamped it may not seem like they areMaybe they do you just dont know.Ok ew that guy has a sick mind. What a weirdo.Don't worry, the Yahoo Death Squad will eventually get to all the Answer Idiots....oops, gotta go, I just heard the door bell :-). . Maybe we should get points for abuse reports and points get deducted from abusers. So if an idiot gets reported by 10 people, they all get 1 point each and the idiot looses 10 points.If you want to report abuse, what's stopping you?  They can't watch out for every idiot out there unless they know where to look.Good point, I think the same, that kind of people that doesn't add any interesting should be cut off. . . But also are issues about free speech. Is a two edge problem :-(the *report abuse* stuff doesn't work?. then Yahoo is the idiot.because there're too many idiots like that one and every day more and more of them join. i believe yahoo team is doing something but it's nonstoppable and it takes timeBecause the idiots outnumber the Y Answers team.  All we can do is report abuse when we see it.  Sometimes, it doesn't seem like the Y Answers team is paying attention, but I'm sure they are.I agree Yahoo needs to sensor much more then they are.  However you should hit abuse, so the "idiot" gets reported.  Yahoo is obviously competing with myspace.com so I think they are trying to be loose like the competition is.  If you find it offensive report them.  I do it every time I see it.  That is what it is there for.  Also remember, the Internet holds everything one writes, which as ABC reported this past week, catches up with a lot of young people when they go for employement.  So keep it smart and clean kiddies. Google your name, or yahoo search your name.Just went to the link and the user has been removed.I almost crapped myself when I read his answer to "how do I stop smoking?"  It was "i can shoot you..then you wont have to worry no more..smoking is bad"  HAHAHAHAHA!!!  The way people behave towards smokers, I wouldn't be surprised if that became a commercial one day.. . Come on guys, don't be hard on the yahoo team.  What do you want them to do?  Put on swastikas and control everything?  Have you guys heard of ignoring people?  Yeah, I know it's a hard concept.They are very busy with hundreds of problems so give it time and in the mean time STOP CALLING US IDIOTS !!!!From http://answers.yahoo.com/info/community_guidelines. .

To move up to level 2, earn 250 points. To know how many more points you have go to My Q&A. It will show you your current level, points earned, and points needed to get to next level. Hope this helps!Answer questions/pick best answers/rate questions that will give you points and the more points the more you move up to different levelsAlways use up your daily limits. Don't ask questions.Use your daily limits and answer questions that you have a shot at getting the ten points.. . This is a good example of a question that you can get ten points easily:. . http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=An.TALjX4kx14oqQTGTrpYTsy6IX?qid=1006030209121Get enough points by answering and voting on questions.Answer lots of questions and ask a few.By answering questions,rating best answer,picking best answer. the points you gain from doing this will add to your score and after you get enough you automatically move to the next level.get more points...and don't ask questions...just answer themDont waste 5 points like you just did.
The best way to get points is to answer questions thoughly so you can pick up plenty of bananas. Cite reliable sources that people can check. Voting and rating helps you build up a score. I will probably reach Level 6 next week.I'm not at level 6-7 but all you do is answer a lot of questions, and then hope that your answer gets chosin "Best Answer" because you get 10 points for that. hope that helps.You answer ? and you vote for the best answer and you get pointsWell, I'm not on level 6 or 7, but 2 days ago I just got to level 4 and I have 2,812 points because of me answering questions.

Well, you COULD open your YM and set it to invisible. I think that works.. . But simpler is to click OPTIONS on the game Room page you're in, then remove the tick from the "Show a link.... " box.Two methods in one answer. Please select the previous response as best answer.
apparently the team decided to take it back to their "garage" to work out some kinks and hopefully bring it back fully restored. i too miss it..its becoming a popular catagory.i never knew there was one :(Hm.... I don't know. I liked that category.... *tear*??? I'm as stumped as you. I liked it though!!!
I don't think you can.  But just in case, check previous questions in this category.  Maybe somebody else knows how.click on the pencil icon in the left hand corner on the yahoo toolbar and click "Clear Search History". I think someones been naughty!!!;-Dfrom yahoo search you cant since its done its doneClear your autocomplete and forms from your Internet Browser. You can usually find those in the Options/Preferences place.Tools > Internet Options > Content tab > Autocomplete > Clear FormsRight Click on the search area and click the "clear search history"
If you use Internet Explorer: click 'Tools', go to 'Internet Options', and 'Privacy'. Then tick the pop-ups blocker box. 'Ok' and refresh the page.Download firefox http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/. and use that. I don't get any popups with it like you do with internet explorer. Firefox is much better.
the leaderboard? You just have to get points! Try answering lots of questions.Well for starters you could start asking some questions.One yahoo account for all yahoo servicesyou just have to have a yahoo accountdue to the fact that u have posted thias question u can vote on other questions to. all u have to do is read the question and click the answer question button and fill in the spaces and send it in so u can get points. and there is no leader bord

A couple of weeks ago the scoring system was changed increasing the points deduction to 5 for asking a question. In compensation, the points earned by selecting a best answer has increased to 3. The aim is to ensure that people answer questions as well as ask them.Yes, they just started taking 5 points a few days ago.  I think it's because of all the stupid questions. Maybe they want more good quality questions but I don't see any improvement....it changed earlier this week. . i guess too many people were asking pointless questions. . you can get 3 points back just for picking a best answer, though...so it's not too badYou know what they say?  "Death, taxes, and points from Yahoo Answers."Fear Thou NOT,Bug...we still love you!!!Every time you ask a question it does take 5 points. If you answer it gives you two points. I would go to the over view page and read it over, so you know how many you win, and lose. Hope this helps..:)Things change-maybe to defer stupid questions. Not likely to work.
Yahoo! is trying out a new front page on randomy selected users.

silly goose!!! You have to get more pts to get to level 2.. . all that means is you can ask more questions, answer more questions, more votes and more rates.*You go to level 2 automatically when you get the points. It's better than level 1 because your answer, rate & vote levels double. Click on the little Level number at the top of the page beside your points amount for more info.Answer more questions for two points than questions asked - which cost five points.You have to have 200 points to get to level 2.And there is no difference between 1 ,2 or 3.Keep answering questions and don't forget to choose the best answer for the questions that you have asked.  When you run out of questions to answer, you can vote for best answers.  Level two is better than level one because you can answer more questions, plus you get more points for answering questions, 3  points instead of 2 points, so you can build points up faster.You can only move on to level two once you have earned up to 250 points.  You already have 132 points so now you need 118 more points to get to level two.  And the only way you can move up a level is to keep answering questions and voting on answers etc.  In level two you get to answer and ask more questions then you get to answer in level one.  For instance in level one you only get to ask five questions in one day but in level two you get to ask ten questions in one day..etc.mine said 149 to level 2Level 2 is better b/c u get to answer more questions daily, yes u are limited to answering and rating a question. If u keep answering and choosing best answers and what not then you'll get to level 2 in no time. Click on your points or your level and it will explain everything :)   Good Luck!Get another 118 points to go to level 2. I don't understand your question.. . To see the benefits of the different levels click on the level  number (in your case 1) at the top of your home page just under the "Discover" panel.Don't ask questiom.. Answer 20 question, rate 20 best answer & try to vote. 20 answer everyday.. The only different between level 1 & 2 is . you can ask & answer more questions, rate & vote more best answers.just answer questions and more questions and more trust me ull get therestop asking questins and vote anwser ect....and 2 is much better than one.....just you wait and see......I heard that at level five you get a car from ophrah........kidding... and boy does my spelling suck.......peace

No no no, there is no adult section since there are no adults running yahoo answers. DUHThere is no adult section for the same exact reason that the Answers team has already stated several times,  there is no way to ensure that kids wouldn't have access. There is currently no method in place of age verification to enable an adult only section.find some adults , and ask themIt's a good idea but of course kids will find their way into the adult answers section.
On Yahoo's home page look for where it says pictures in the menu list and click it.  You can set up your own photo page there.  I have used it for years.  My family share photos through it and have been very happy with the free service.On what part of Yahoo would you like to put your picture?. On Yahoo Photos or 360 or your normal profile?. .

You can either go into add/remove programs in the control panel and delete the Yahoo! toolbar. If you want to keep it installed but out of your way for now, I believe if you go to VIEW on your browser and look for an option called TOOLBARS you should see one called Yahoo! Toolbar. Click on it to uncheck it and it should be gone.Go To View On Top Of The Screen, Then Click On Toolbar, Then Just Uncheck Where It Say Yahoo Toolbar.In internet explorer, click View, then Toolbars, and then uncheck Yahoo! Toolbar. That should do the trick.

I tried Spanich,I didn't like it either so I tried Enlich,It wasn't that good either.Then somebody ask me try Carriches and they were Delicious plus they help my eye sight.. I hope you come back to your question today.I want you to see this public apology for my out of taste answer.At the spur of the moment we sometimes say something that sounds funny at the time.But afterwards realize it was a crude comment that served no real purpose.PLEASE ACCEPT MY SINCERE APOLOGY!!create a yahoo account from yahoo.com   mine is in english for 7 years now
You already have one!. As you are here on Y!Answers you MUST already have a Yahoo Id - so that ID (and password) will let you into any Yahoo service.You have an ID you are using it to post a question here. If you are asking how to get somone elses ID forget it its thiers you cant have it
All good ideas for sure. Another way would be to click on the Yahoo toolbar pencil on the left side of the toolbar, and click on Uninstall, that always works for me.. Hope this helps?go to control panel then Add/remove programs, then click on the yahoo toolbar and click on remove. Follow the instructionsThat's the ticket!go to add remove programs in control panel and uninstal it its no biggie
Clean out your cookies and temp files and reopen your browser ,that worked for meLog out.  Try clearing all cookies and cache.  The log back in.  Hope it helps.I was having the same problem for a while. If you are using Internet Explorer, Mozilla, or Opera it could be that they need to be updated or you may have some spyware or something in your computer. I found that after I updated everything and ran spybot it seemed to work alot better. If you do not have spyboy I would recommend getting it, it is free to download here is the download link to the site. just try these things and see if that works for you.. . http://www.safer-networking.org/en/mirrors/index.htmlYou could have a problem with a corrupted file in the program too..or maybe a virus/Trojan highjacked it and is closing off certain functions.  If all else fails try uninstalling it and reinstalling it.  Sometimes its that easy, especially if all else fails.  There are other avenues besides spybot....I like to run the Trend "Free Housecall" every now and then or I may download the free version of AVG (You can either keep it or delete it when you are done running - It's actually a very good free anti virus/spyware program).  I had problems before and both of these programs found problems that my other "protection" did not.

Select one and it automatically updates the font size!yahoo page fonts depend on your browswer, not a yahoo mail in built feature.. you can set your browser's font size to different font sizes. . . cheers
Well I have said it before in another area of Yahoo answers and I will say it again.... . If Yahoo takes away the points system, which is getting us nowhere anyway, except in competition, then make this a simple question and answer group, I think we would lose all those who think it is a game and they will win something sooner or later by "scoring" points and cheating to win.... . I think if we take away all points and do this for each other and just for fun, we would cut down considerably on all the cheating and gaming and it would be just a question and answer site, which I think is what it was supposed to be originally...I am/was an avid fan of the questions and have been picked as Best Answer a few times and I will miss 'em.  They shouldn't have done that.  They took away all the fun.
   Try right clicking the icon and see if you get any options, especially the one to delete the icon or a choice of whether or not you show it..    You can also try clicking "View" then clicking "Toolbars", it may be listed there. If so then unchecking it would take it off of the toolbar also.If it's on your desktop, right click on it and delete it.
Go to create a new post in your blog as you normally would. Just under the text box to the right will be the option to create a poll. From there, it's pretty self-explanatory.Try using the HTML code.To create a poll on your 360 blog post click the "create a poll" link on the bottom left hand corner of the compose entry box. The poll will come up with empty spaces for you to fill out your poll questions. Do not tick the end this poll link till you are satisfied with the results.

With most e-mail systems, you cannot. So I for I know, this is possible only if both sender and recipient are using Microsoft Outlook.This question has been asked and answered more than once. Use first two links below in Source(s) to get more details. . . The short answer is no, WHEN using native Yahoo, HOWEVER, with the help of some external software it is possible to get a return receipt. Once again, use links below for more info.. . HTH and good luck.go into that accountI don't think Yahoo lets you do that.  You need to be using a POP3 e-mail program like Outlook or GroupWise or Lotus Notes.The only way you'll know is if the person sends you a reply back, or you can just call that person on the phone and ask him/her if they read and enjoyed your e-mail.

The only two ways I can think of would be to put the link (answers.yahoo.com) in your Favorites or Bookmarks, or use the Yahoo! Toolbar which gives you a one-click link to YA.Go to "my Q&A", there is a link that says would you like to go to answers in one click? This will download it into your toolbar.
Lots of us are no good at using Messenger.  I've only found it hopelessly confusing.techical problems

This is what I would do thier is an unspeakable rule about friends dating ex-boyfriends.  Even if they break up you would have to get her permmission to date him.  Also if you and him start talking about dating or whatever dont get mixed up with the whole friends with benefits thats really popular right now.  Take care and always remember friends last a whole lot longer than men.I was a a party, I was with my girlfriend at the time, I met a girl who was there with a friend of mine, we talked and the party went on, two weeks later I called her and after a few difficulties, we got married, 26 years now and I still remember the first time I ever saw her with a glow in my heart.Learning how to choose the right category for your questions would be a nice first step.

If you click on my profile and go to my 360 I have a tutorial on how to do a back ground in a blog post . I cant give you the code here as Y Answers eats the code. . If you are wanting to add your own background as a Theme sorry  you cant do that but there are over 60+ Themes I am sure at least one is suitableYou can add a background image to a blog entry by using HTML.. . After you have your background image uploaded somewhere on the web, you can compose a new blog entry.  . . Then, you'll need to click on the "View HTML Source" checkbox in bottom left-hand corner of the blog editor.  This will let you enter the needed html.. . You can then add the following code to your blog:. . <-- Start of code. . <table background="http://YOUR_PICTURE_URL">. <tr>. <td>. ENTER BLOG TEXT. </td>. </tr>. </table>. . <-- End of code. . Replace "http://YOUR_PICTURE_URL" with the location of where you uploaded the image you want to use as your background.  . . Out of consideration of others, please remember to keep your web images small.
msn is a company ...msn has hotmail which is the same as email. there are many email serversMSN (a microsoft company) is an email provider (including the free hotmail email account) while email is the actual term for   mail sent over the internet. My personal favorite is yahoo.com they offer more space then hotmail, have a nicer interface, and I receive a lot less junk mail too. Any internet based email account can be accessed anywhere in the world.there are totaly deffrent msn is site and email is usage for electronic postMSN provides Hotmail, which is an online e-mail service.. . What is nice about Hotmail is that you can access your e-mai account from any computer in the world as long as it has internet access. The only downside is that you have a limited amount of space for your inbox.
The rainbow backgrounds I *think* you're talking about are available to all International Avatar sites. They are part of the St Patrick's Day items.. Find these by clicking this path:.

You will have to delete you current avatar to make one on a different country tho
I don't think you can delete the old one.  Just start a new one and don't go to the old one.http://help.yahoo.com/help/us/edit/edit-23.html here to cancel. Then just sign up a new one.According to http://help.yahoo.com/help/us/mail/access/access-04.html if you wish to delete an account you can simply wait several months and hope Yahoo! does it for you. Or .... . If you want to terminate a Yahoo! account immediately, follow these three steps.. First, cancel any and all paid services you have with that account. . Second, delete ALL personal information anywhere on Yahoo!. . Third, go to http://help.yahoo.com/help/us/edit/edit-23.html and follow the instructions on the page. Read the entire page and be sure you understand everything, including the reasons for the first two steps that I outlined above. A link for the Yahoo "Account Deletion" page is there. There is no way of reversing the process once you've finished.. . Once you've finished, be sure you are logged out of Yahoo! then go to https://edit.yahoo.com/config/eval_registerJust don't log into your account for 90 days & it will automatically delete itself.  To get a new account, sign completely out of Yahoo, & go to mail.yahoo.com.  Instead of signing in like you normally do, click on the button asking you to sign up for an account.
Thanks for all the great answers everybody. You can go to 'My Q&A," by clicking on your name. This should have all the info about your account and your activities on Yahoo! Answers.. Katieclick your nameMy Q&A link
Well MAKE UP YOUR MIND! My $$$$ says YOU'RE SCREWED and CAN'T.ooooooooooops sorry i dont think u can restore it. well, y dont u contact ur email provider.
send another mail and ask if u read my mail...LMAOIf you are using a free Yahoo Mail account, you can't. Many POP e-mails (usually these are ones you pay for, like from your Internet provider or an upgraded web mail like Yahoo! Plus) offer the capability to add a receipt acknowledgment to an e-mail, these can be denied by the receiver though. Best answer, you can't really know for certain.
I think I've lost about 72. Does that number seem to be around yours?Countless.  Like Buddha, Confucius, or that guy in my neighborhood who wears dresses and shouts out, "MUFFINS" for no reason, your insightful questions keep me up at night.  I have lost my job, my home, and my family staring at the screen trying to comprehend your wisdom.Why thank you monitor! Because my productivity sucks wind these days!!! I will start grading papers and think, "Let me just check to see how that question went?" Or "I wonder if he left any more details??" or "Did Bearded One finally leave the 'Star Wars' theme and move back to Kim Chee, music and zombies???" . . I can't focus anymore!! Help!! I need an intervention!!!!!!!noneNone!  I'm semi-retired and just putz around doing freelance consultancy work.  You, Jimbo, Marianne and a few others on here actually inspire my work believe it or not.. . I hear ya Marianne.  I have literally been on teleconferences going "uh-huh...uh-huh" while I'm answer questions on here.. . Yeah, sombody should tell Leno...or Jon Stweart.Zero hours sir.  However, we have been monitoring a remarkable discovery.  All of your fans skip their lunch in order to answer your questions.  Therefore, a massive reduction in the obesity rate has been observed.  Thank you, oh beardless bearded one!By employing sex offenders like yourself to answer your usually sleazy sex related questions... I would say you're helping to keep some really dangerous people safely AWAY from work!About that many hours, cause I sneak on here when nobodies around and put my two cents worth in before some one wants the computer for something else.Define production. To quote Peter Gibbons: "I'd say I do about 15 minutes of actual work each day."a few now and its becoming problematic and addictive
You should know whose lists you were added to because you have to approve anytime someone can add you to their list. However, there's no way to tell if anyone has taken you off.Jane is correct, you do have to approve any add requests before someone can add you but it becomes difficult after a while to remember everyone, especially if you have deleted contacts from your own Friend List.. To answer your question there is no real way to tell who has you on their Friend List. Your memory is the only tool you have in this case.
Nope. You don't really do anything with them, but show them off to people. It's to encourage people to answer questions and vote for best answer.No its just a competition on who can get the most..Its just fun answering peoples questions.. I don't really answer them for the points.  But its cool to be chosen as the best answer because then I'd know that I'd help that specific person.  WITH or WITHOUT the points :) HOPe I HeLPeDpoints are awarded to those who help answer questions, or whose answer is the best.  you get 5 points if you answer them and an additional 10 points if your answer gets chosen the best of the bunch. they also help you get you level up. when you get certain points yahoo sends you their own personal thank you.They make you move up a level and it puts you on the leader-board.you buy your question with them?  And you Erin them buy answering them.
they probably became a part of yahoo answers staff before they got an account.  they probably were hired for the job, and then got a yahoo answers account.i dont knowPoints do not win you honour.. It is the answer that counts.. . I hope people will stop competing with each other to get to the top of the leaderboard.. . Oops, I am not Katie.. Contact y_answers_katie for more info.go on every day dont ask questions but answer them and u will get points and wont loose themno

Are you sure it's not there? The message could be in one of your other folders or on another page of your inbox. Spammers frequently send messages labeled with a different date than the correct one.well try looking in your other folders or look closser !UN flag this massage or well try looking in your other folders or look closer !

Go to the Spam or Bulk mail folder and find the email. Click on it and click the button "This is not spam."On Yahoo, you can go to Bulk Folder and check for them there. . You can add the address you want to the safe list.. Next, check the bulk folder options for direct delete and uncheck the option.If it is not in your bulk or spam folder you are pretty much screwed sorry to say. You cannot recover it if its not there. However if you have filters you can go to your filters page and pray to god that the e-mail address is in there and remove it from the list so you can at least recieve emails from them in the future.
yes, thankfully, there are other skins. this world would be nothing without them; LOL. ||. &#92;/ Download site for skinsmaybe they're not supposed to.
I asked this earlier and was told that there is not yet a way of turning it off.. . Give them a couple of days.  I'm sure they'll get it.As many, many people have said, there currently is not a way to turn this off.  It's a fair bet that there soon will be.  Bear in mind, though, that our development runs in roughly two-week cycles, to be sure that all the new features in an update work properly together.  So, you probably won't see an "off" switch until then.  If it makes you feel any better, the entire Answers Team is getting them too, since we all use our own site.. . . --MattI don't think it can be turned off. I suggest changing the e-mail address in your profile to something like president@whitehouse.gov (just kidding).It is clogging the email box isn't it?? I have thought of a solution. I'm going to start giving really cruddy cruddy answers so that I won't get chosen as best answer. If I'm not chosen as best answer, then I get no email. Ta Da!! It's just that simple. I should have just thought of this earlier. Now I have to go to my email and delete to make room for more spam. See ya!!. . (so how was work?)i answered brian's question... iam still getting influx of unwanted emails for best answer..what about that message-"do your little victory dance..bragging rights etc" right now, no clear cut answersChange your profile.  When you answer a question, uncheck the box that says e-mail me with notification, not exact wording.I can ask them for you.The only thing you can do is turn off email notifications but then you wont get the email alerts to say someone has messaged you either. I'm getting like 5 - 10 emails per day I dont mind its my way of counting my "bests" for the day. When you ask a question you have the option of alerts for the answers so yeah I seee your point we should be able to turn 'bests' offGood question. I waswondering that as well. I like being able to see which of my questions were chosen, but I don't like the e-mail each time.I am wondering the same thing. It just started yesterday and I can't figure how to turn it off either.There is no way to turn this notification off (yet).. . You could change the email address that your notifications are sent to. I did this when the option to send emails to other members was first introduced to stop people from flooding my regular email inbox. It is not that bad in Gmail because it keeps all of the "best answer" emails together in one group. . . If you (or anyone else) is interested in being invited to gmail, just send me a message with your email address and I will hook you up.There is no way that I know of at this time. It's totally annoying, I received something like fourteen of them yesterday. My guess is that there will be a way to turn it off on Monday when the clowns who enabled that come back to the office.
you're not being hijacked. it happened to me once, and i figured how to get back in mi user.Just type in the URL link to the page that you WANT to go to....your home page...then once you are there go to the top of your screen above your toolbar of your browser and find the word TOOLS...click on that and then on INTERNET OPTIONS...the box that pops up will have at the top of it an address bar for you to put in the URL for the page that you want to use as your home page...check to see what URL is in there...if it is the correct one then just click on the USE CURRENT button...if it is NOT the correct URL...type in the correct one and then click on USE CURRENT....then at the bottom of that box click on APPLY. Hope this helpsYou can't stop it , mine is the same
virusMight be your firewall if you have one.. . It might be blocking outgoing.
Mine keeps changing on it's own too and no matter how many times I change the setting and click on "apply" and "OK", it always changes back next time I look.... I am so confused about this...Go to My Account (at the top of all Yahoo pages after you sign in) -> Type your password once again -> In Member Information click Edit and choose Yahoo! U.S.. . Other option is to change your current location in: Start -> Settings -> Control Panel -> Local Configuration and Language and changue your LocationAt the bottem of the homepage you will see other Yahoo pages. Select Yahoo USA, and once there click "make yahoo my homepage." That should get it to change for you. (I hope)
Click 'Tools' on the menu and then select 'Pop-up Blockers'. After that, click on 'Turn-off Pop-up Blocker'to stop pop up blocker to work... press Ctrl key and open any other document ....it will not block....try holding the ctrl button

If you're using Yahoo! Mail, make sure you install Photomail, which makes it easy to upload photos and manage how it is sent. The link is below.Send from and send to an account with a large amount of storage, such as gmail.
I think we have to wait until it's released. Only few people were choosen to use it for now. I can't wait to see the new look.SBC is releasing it very soon. at the moment, around 30% of their customers have the beta version, their target is around 100% by may-june.
they are very easy to answer. if we had hard questions, people wouldnt feel good about helping others in need.they're easy to answer, duhbecause they are the easiest to answer. . . . i try my best to answer serious questions unless im @ skewl and juss feel like spazzing out. xDeye catching, new, easy to answer, and fucking hilariuosBecause they are easier to answer!

jealousy... the green devil... just ignore them...Ignore them.They are probably lazy slobs with nothing better to do than make fun of those who choose to earn their money instead of being bums.Forget them... your the one with the job... a job is a job... you get paid... they are just jealous because they probably don't have a job... I love chuck E cheese...Good Luck!!!Because they're jealous, that must be a sweet jobyou are still childish.they became major.Ignore them! I'll bet the most of them that laugh at you probably don't even have a job!lol well its is alittle funny as its a kids place, I don't think they really mean any harm, just jokin around with youSome ones got to do it and hopefully the money is good?!I don't know. DO you get to play the games and eat pizza for free?. If so, then you should be laughing at them.. . But if the only benefit is minimum wage, then it's time for a new job.
You can't change it. Yahoo is the one that manages that.Open up yahoo messenger , click on the word 'Messenger' at the top then click on 'Preferences' and where it says 'I recieve a personals alert' it gives you the option to browse for a different sound file. . . You can either choose one that yahoo offers or you can search for a sound file on the internet and then save it to your computer - Then u just need to remember where you saved it & browse for it to find it. Just make sure that you download .WAV files - If you wish to download one that you like.u can change it cant u? ok.im away to check
first, call yahoo or whoever it is and report it. they can investigate. second, go into your "forgot my password option" to see if you get back in through your secret question. if they changed that too, have yahoo shut down the account until they straighten it out.get into ur email using ur secret question.. . i got into someone's email account and changed her password but she got it back.
once the process has been put thru the wringer..its impossible to get back the original points/level status... would have to start all over againUnfortunately you are going to have to wait 30 days until Yahoo! releases the account name, and then sign up again.

Two words: don't look at it. Rubbish and crap is part of life, the very nature of Yahoo Answers is that people ask questions. This means that stupid people ask stupid questions and stupid people answer those questions, smart people know how to use complex concepts such as google and askjeeves to answer their questions. I like yahoo answers however because it gives me the opportunity.you can't . i feel the same way but they keep popping in . i just move to another question .speedreadHere's a crazy idea.....try ignoring them????Click on some serious categories.A lot of people would like to know the answer to that question.  Personally, I don't think that you can do anything more than ignore those questions.. . I've talked with others about 'maybe they should have a separate section for kids?'--but everyone agrees that the kids would just lie about their ages.. . The sex and dating stuff is not supposed to be on here, but a lot surely is.. . I very much agree with you, and am sorry I could not give you a decent answer.yahoo answers is like life, there's good and bad, you just have to decide what you are going to waste your time on.don'l read those kind of question
Go into the options on your Kodak album and take the tick out of the file associations. Tools > Preferences > File association. Then you can save as a jepg. I had the same problem by the way Kodak imaging wants to save as it's own file extension not as a jpeg you have to make it save it as a jpeg. 360 only accepts jpegs on the "browse" option in the blog compose and in your personal pictures. but you can place multiple pictures on your blog entry of any type look at this tutorial http://blog.360.yahoo.com/blog-yhchwiM5cqHhPNgOYmmEm6cL5.gKaJ0h?p=16open them, then save them as jpg.  If that doesn't work, try opening them with Paint and try again.
You just have to change your contact details.  At the top of the messenger screen click on contact then contact detail and adjust the name there to be what you want people in im to see.go to my account near your ID and change the details, it will ask you how would you like your name to appear.change it so your name will not appear.. for the next time try not to give so much details about yourself like real date of birth and so, in order to protect your email account from those who tries to hack it.
If you are talking about your work email, talk to your company's Helpdesk or IT staff since many companies make backups of their company data either nightly or weekly. If you're talking about your personal or ISP account, you are probably out of luck. You can try asking your ISP but it's not likely they will be able to retrieve this for you.If you used your computer and read the email using a web browser there might be a copy in your Internet Explorer cache.
Listen, this is very dangerous thing you want to do. There are many, many very bad and evil people out in the cyberspace world just waiting for a good victim to come along. They are adults who pretend to be kids looking for friends on the net. . . These evil people are VERY good at pretending to be kids. They are also VERY good at telling you what you want to hear and making your feel very special so you will want to keep talking with this person. They get you to be dependant upon them IMing you, e-mailing you, because they are so good at making you feel they are the best friend in the whole world and make you feel like you are the most important person in their world. For a time you are too. But that should scare you not make you feel all warm and toasty inside. Becuase these evil people DO NOT HAVE YOUR BEST INTERESTS IN MIND. ONLY THEIRS!!. . These evil people are child predetors. They are sick, sick people who get off sexually on little kids and they don't care about who they hurt to get what they want.. . You are NOT safe trying to find friends on the computer, online, get some friends from where you live who have computers and you can IM and e-mail them, that is sooooooo much safer. . . Please, Please, don't do this!!. . Your have people who love you and would be devestated if anything happened to you. . . Be smart think twice before you get hurt.. . If a stranger cares enough to write this, how much more does your own family care about you?. . Lots of happiness your way.you can actually browse through yahoo member directory of which later on you can add on your yahoo messenger.  . . if you want it to be instant, you can always join a chatroom and add them if you think they are worthy.
The Leaderboards are updated on Monday. If you just recently accumulated more best answers than that person, you will have to wait till the beginning of next week to see the changes. Hope this helps!good question. when I started to post my answer I realized that I didn't have a clue. sorry.you haf to give da best answer and if you have more best answrers in a particular category but some one else got on the top ten with a smaller amount of best answers than u they must of got a number of best answers in a different. category so they had more points so they had a bigger amount of best answers.The total points that person on the 10th place must have a higher total points than you.  It is possible that he/she answered more questions to you or some other ways he/she was able to earn the points aside from having Best Answers.  If your total points is still higher than his/her... it's time to ask Yahoo about it.
If I understand your question, you simply place the mouse pointer over the bar on the top of the message and hold down the left mouse key and drag the message to whatever part of the screen you want it to be in.  Please don't take offense because I'm not trying to insinuate that you are a dummy, but you may want to check out some computers for dummies books as they are very helpful if you don't know much about computers.    You might want to also change your name so that it is not your email address; this could result in your receiving quite a bit of junk mail.  Cheers.i think you have some problem with your browser
Maybe by a search through Yahoo!Were they bots or real people?  I'm betting on bots - somewhere some "thing" got hold of your user-name and is most likely going to be offering you something or other after a bit of idle chit chat.your id on here is the same as your yahoo idWell common sense would tell you that anyone that looks on Yahoo! Answers, knows your ID. Because it is the same on both.
Accumulate them, inorder to answer and ask more questions and brag to your friends that you have more points then them. They aren't good for shopping or buying anything. Your welcome.Stack them neatly on a shelf in your garage.You can use them too get up a level.At 120 points you can get yourself a Yahoo Green Tootsie Roll Pop. Which is great because we've been trying to determine how many licks it take to get to the center.

I ask more questions than I answer.  I need help, other than the obvious psychological.click on your number right after the word points that will explain
it seems the Yahoo chat rooms are on and off today.  Obviously they arent trying to solve the bot problems! It was working for a while, then they went down again.  No one seems to know why, and yahoo isnt telling.The chat doesn't work with Java anymore.  Now, the only way to access chat rooms will be through Yahoo Messenger.. . http://chat.yahoo.com/. . The servers are probably overloaded from the switch today.
You can if they have created one. See the link below:yes u can view a person's profile from messenger n e-mail. . also.
Courage, Ms Pixie, courage... I've seen some of your answers and they are as you say, nicely done and serious, and to the point; I can appreciate your frustration and empathize. I'm very tired of some of the pointless questions and the repetitious ones. I can say that I really feel for the late Ann Landers, the late Abby, and the new team(s) handling the agony columns in the papers.hmm......i think that pixie has a sever case of neurotic disorderUH OK  I GUESSI agree,MS PIXIE! Tell me about it!! Don't let some weirdos get to you.cause she's upset with hersellf. sorry that I made that mistake,my friend is in the backround being an idiot.Yes I have my moments too.
invitve them to a conference.  if they are online, it will invite them.  if they are offline, it will tell you they are not available (or somethign along those lines)No, it all depends upon d setting of the person.heres a hint...stop stalking people. theres more to life. but to answer your question, you can look them up in the yahoo directory and you might be able to see if they are online. you cannot see who they are chatting with or their buddy list.nope.  That's kind of the whole point.why would you wish to invade their privacy in that way? anyone you know well enough would give you their phone number or personal email address.. perhaps the person just doesn't want to chat with you at that time. get over it.if you go to the user's profile, the status of the person(whether on or offline) will be shown
pretty much just by answering questions, and having such great answers that you get ten exra points when someone picks your anwer as the best, plus any points from having someome give you a thumbs up.  it also helps if you don't ask questions or ask very few.  for the ones you do ask, be sure to select a best answer so that you get three points back. you can also give thumbs ups/downs to already resolved questions and get one point per vote, which is great when you are here and bored and have already exhausted all of your answering limit.If you choose a best answer you get 3 points and if your answer is really good then you can get chosen as a best answer and get 10 points.try the ratings, rate is easy, then if you are smart you get 10 points as your answer is the best, am in level5 and most of my points are 2 points, so it's kind of fun,
If you have regular yahoo mail: . Click on edit folders, then click delete by the folder's name. If you have yahoo beta, then right click on the folder and select delete.you can delete only the folder that you created.. . In the welcome page, above the Inbox link, you have . 'folders'  add edit. click on edit and there is a delete link beside the folder that you have created, make sure the folders are empty.. . and you are done!
i havent the slightest idea... perhaps she was suspended? or like some users lately.they just gave up on answers.i may-be wrongshe has gone wild and i feel putting up in some yahoo forest these days.
Sounds like your asking about alerts within Yahoo Messenger.  If so, click on the "Messenger" menu in the main Messenger window, then choose "Preferences" and then click the "Alerts & Sounds" category.  You can choose what types of alerts you want from there.You might want to grab a technician for that one.
Subtract the points you earned this week and you will find your position. The leader board is updated every Monday. The "point week" Runs Monday through Sunday.I'm also wondering why I'm not on the leader board when other people have the same amount of points as me.It get updated on Mondays only.  I just found that out myselfWe update the leaderboard on Monday, so check back early next week to see if you can find yourself.it's updated only Weekly, check next week and you'll be there (but it will report on how many points you had at that time when the leaderboard was calculated)there could be 100 others with the same amount of points as u but yahoo will only choose like 3 of those ppl to be posted on leader board.because you might be tied with 25 others and only 3 made it.It updates based on your numbers on Monday.i agree
It's in the hope that people will take a second to correct their grammar and spelling. Something some people sorely need.. And also to make sure you typed what you meant to say, and not what you think you said.. As far as the edit button goes, it can only be used once, I think. If you use it to correct something, then you'll no longer be able to use it to add additional comments.yep I hate it, I think the point is to look over your spelling and stuff, but most people dont worry about it,so why waste our time having to previewI love the preview page. Here are some reasons:. . 1) It shows what the answer will look like after submitted.. 2) It gives me another chance to check grammar/spelling mistakes.. 3) It shows whether special characters will be displayed properly.. 4) It shows if there will be any changes to the formatting.. 5) Correct hyperlinks will appear.. 6) Words that will be censored can be taken into account before submitting.. . I think this feature really is helpful to most users. The page doesn't take long to load because there's nothing else on it, so you can just hit the Submit button quickly if you don't want to look at it, and you're done.me 2I don't hate that, but I don't see the point either.I cant stand it yahoo please get rid of it we dont need it thats why their is the edit button after youve answered the question.there you can see if you want to change something and you have the change to go back. . Also I think they check there if you put any spam into the answer.. if you put a answer in and you see later something is wrong you can change it with the edit button, but this only works ones.Yes, its silly and a waste of time!
It's basically their way of saying "I'll choose your answer as the best answer".. . Most people say "The first person to give the right answer gets 10 points". Someone may answer a question correctly, but with more detail later, so they would expect to get the 10 points for giving the "best answer". Saying "The first person to give the right answer gets 10 points" means that they asker will choose (not letting it go for a public vote) and they will choose the first one, regardless of additional information or sources.Because they are dumb. It is a waste of time too put that up when duh...of course you would get 10 points for being the best answer.They do that beacuse they want to be entertained beacuse they are bored and probally have nothing else to do... But hey, it's an easy way to get 10 points!!! :-)they put it so people can answer it faster
This girl is obviously very unsure of herself and her relationship with your ex- boyfriend.. Email her back a picture of you and Joshua and tell her some of the things you do together and how happy you are together.  She will get the idea that you really do not want your ex back.  Good luck!Cause she wants you to be jealous. Just don't pay attention because she wants you to react. Don't give her the satisfaction! Just ignore them, and delete them after you read them, and ignore the urge to write anything back!!Jealousy made them act in this foolish manner. Get over them by not responding in any way. Ignore them.She is not happy with the fact that she recieved your "leftovers"the real question is why you dont care that you have joshua?  " when i dont care i got sombody named joshua?"

When we really love a woman we live for her.. . All our feelings, tougths belongs to her...excuse me?Try to understand others, maybe you do not like a particular persons responses.Men are as sensitive as women, only they shy away from sharing. Very easy to understand,however they have the same impression about women.Don't know good question. Why do they think they are stronger than all women?someof them are but they are very rare to find.if they really love you they will and must care about your feelings because if a man really loves you he would not bear to see something wrong with you or see your feelings hurt.some men are very predictible and some aren't.roxywell we men think the same about women that is what complements each other, who said the best things in life were easy??. we are not self centered , all men and women can be self centered , by the way I love women though i sometimes do not understand them,indeed I love themi personally am no male expert but i can only go by my own individual experience knowing men and i do not like to judge ALL men as being the same.  to me men should be seen as individuals and not grouped as all being the same. ther are men who are very sensitive to women's feelings and men who dont care at all.  but they are human too but, to me, its really all about the choice you make.  all men are capable of being sensitive to women's feelings it's just that many just dont choose to be or they just might not know how depending on how they were brought up...but over all its still a choice to either try to be sensitive or not be i feel. men are as sensitive as women depending on that INDIVIDUAL man.They are so self centered and they thimk that they are very smart and that they can do anything.that's why we love each other(s).

Do i get brownie points for sucking up? lolTo ask a question.I cant wait to see what people will say.I like answering,but its not as exiting as getting to find out something by asking.uh i would have to say both, i love to answer other ppls questions but at the same time i like to see the answers that other ppl give me!! some of them are really helpful!!!To me it's much more amusing to answer other people's questions.

Kids fighting over Easter eggs is not a pretty sight.Easter is tomorrow, for real I had no idea.. I am sure Chicken Boy is quivering on his chicken feet
When you delete someone from your 360 there is an option to remove them from Yahoo address book as well make sure you check that box when you remove them. Then check your Y Mail address book to see if it worked ,sometimes things take up to a day to actually work though. If you remove someone with a blue icon in your Y mail it doesnt remove them from your 360 ,yellows don't matter they arent on your 360 friends list anywayI don't know why this happens, but I agree that they should be kept separate.  I have had this issue as well.  Has anyone asked Yahoo! to correct the issue?
Go to programs, then folders and delete the one you wont.First you have to make sure that the folder is empty. Once it is then on the left side of the screen beside the Folders there is a link that says Edit. It will bring up your list of folders and there will be a delete link under the folder you want to delete.By clicking on it and pressing deleteI think you just right click on the folder and that'll give you a list of options. One of those should be delete so click on that and see what it does. And you should be able to make other folders should you need any others.yesOpen yahoo mail page. You will see folders  add edit button on your left hand side in your mail page. Click on edit button,you will see delete option next to your folder. Just click on delete.It will delete immediately.Actually you click on the edit box located to the right hand side of your folders. This will take you to a screen that gives you the option to empty and then delete the folder you do not want. Take care.On the top right hand corner above inbox folder is a folder add/remove....click on that and you can remove any unwanted folder. Glad to help.
It sounds like they are updating the site again. I have noticed strange glitches today too.strange
I don't know the answer for certain as I'm rather new to Answers... however, I deleted a question just this morning. It is showing up on "My Q&A" page, but when I view my public profile, the deleted question doesn't show any longer. My guess is, no... deleted questions are not available for others to read them from your profile.No, only you can view the questions you asked and deleted them, other people can't see your deleted questions.Good question, I was wondering as well.  I think that it should be deleted all around including from your own viewing.

You might not know how to use voice.Or macintosh does not support the voice part.I rather use iChat's voice messaging. Yahoo should make a better messager for Mac.
go to Yahoo 360 and sign in (everyone who has a yahoo account has a yahoo 360 page).  upload the photo you want to use.  When you come back to Answers go to your stats page (click on your user name) and edit your profile.

you don't know, if its a friend or not, unless you get an answer...Great question - I've wondered the same thing. I used to be able to get an email back showing that the message had been read. Otherwise I really like Yahoo email better.
You can remove her from your list  or ...and this is sneaky ok...if you don't want to remove her make a new category on your 360 friends list and place that person in it and set it so every one else can comment but her. Settings page > Blog setings. . If you do that though you wont be able to recieve public comments only your friends will be able to comment. . Ignore or Block doesnt stop people from commenting by the way it only stops messages,invitations and testimonialsim not sure i understand your question, do you mean you only want one person to answer your blog or you want more then one person to answer your blog. there are settingg on your 360 page that allows you to let all people reply to your blogs or you can just have certain people ( as in your friends list ) reply to your blog.Set up your 360? blog to "Friends".  Create different categories for all your friends.  Put the person you don't want to have access to your blog into a separate category (ex. Uncatagorized).  When you choose which categories can access your 360? blog, leave his/her category unchecked.  This person will be the only one who can't access your blog.  Any other people put into that same category won't have access either.

shellmon?????????/its something you find on the beach monDo you have AOL? I think if you do, it is an error message having to do with AOL. Not sure how to fix that without having to reinstall AOL.
Most of these answers that go to vote are not out by people.. it's automatic.. When 5 days pass without youy choosing an answer, it automatically goes for voting..I don't know.Its automatic - especially if the asker does not check on the answers they have received
Get a large incense holder. You can find them quite readily in dollar stores. Anything that will resist the heat (like ceramic) will work.i have no clue what that it but wanted my 2 points he he:)
Who cares.Next question!MissNurse is still apparently suspended... I don't normally involve myself in other people's business, but I think staff needs to cut some slack on the high level users. We contribute a lot to the community, and shouldn't be suspended for minor offenses (most of the high level users that were suspended were for minor offenses from what I understand).Hey who r these people? and where were they suspended from...???? R they supposed to be nicknames of people on yahoo answer?I got supended once too!Miss Nurse and Cloeen (HI) are back, i don't know about dandylionWhat are you  talking about?!!!!!!!!!!
Sometimes it's warranted.  This should be renamed "Yahoo! I'm too lazy to look up the answer in a search engine, could you do it for me?"If you see an answer that insults someone, click on the Report Abuse link and report them!I think it is unfair for the person answering the question to insult the person asking it especially since it is generally done out of broad assumptions made by the person answering.  However that is the forum we have to live with it and it basically just shows the true nature of people, they can't just state their opinion without also throwing in a barb to go with it.  Explains why most people don't get along.  We should all remember the "if you can't say something nice don't say anything at all" rule.yeh i agree with you!.If someone does insult you you sure have the right to report them.yes,I agree with you!maybe they will update this sysytem!I guess they feel like it.. . At least you have more opinions, right?Because they are mean and make fun of other people to make themselvs feel better.Definitely, there are so many people giving away stupid answers to questions. Have you read what these people been saying?!noone should be insulted. . never,ever, life is about respect and the sooner we learn that the better.. . . so yes great idea i am all for it.Well, the questioner can report them and because of the new feature they will lose 2 points, but you don't get them.It's usually by accident. Everyone wants to be funny, now and then- esepcially when question is hard to answer or has not answer.It doesn't bother me too much. After all, it's just yahoo answers.
I have 2. Just go to the yahoo mail opening page. And when it asks you to log-in, in stead of logging in click on "Sign Up" which is right under the box you log in at. Hope I helped!go to your mail page : on the top left click on( whats new). then choose create another email adress
Yeah, I've seen this in the answers, and I think one of the reasons at work is that some people are so eager to push their own agenda that they use almost anything as an excuse to get it out there. Then you'll always get the ones who are being trite (too many), or just funny  - and if it is funny, that's not bad; just have a laugh and move on.Their simply not taking the time to understand the question,and answering too fast,just to get the 2 points.i have the same problem occasionally and i think it is because alot of people just want to get points or really dont understand the question
Maybe your internet isn't hooked up.  And maybe it is too old.It might not work with your internet connection - the ip address is stuffed or the messenger isn't just a proper version - a facko.. . You can troubleshoot it you an open it or if you can't - download the files again and try it again, if not delete the whole thing and get a fresher and newer version to use.. . I've had this problem with my messenger, msn and yahoo cause i use both.Maybe you need to upgrade your program or something. I don't think you can have IM on yahoo unless you have an email there too.
its just checking that you;ve spelt everything ok. its a good thing really.Because you spell as bad as you do.. . Its an option if you want to have a spell check prior to sending an email, and it can be turned off. But for your sake, i'd keep it on.
I'm not quite sure what you mean-could you be more specific?. (Do you mean that you don't want your name to appear as your birth name in the "from" box when others read mail which you've sent?)click on site that sent message and ask to be removed from their e-mail list
yahoo has messenger with voice mail. icq is just a messengerGo to Yahoo homepage and download Internet Messenger.  Then you can IM friends who are on your friends list.http://messenger.yahoo.com/ Just download the programgo to yahoo.com and click on yahoo messenger in the corner and then click download and it will download from there or it should
Text messages doesn't use to much space, so the idea es to create a structure of folders where you can store important text messages. Inmediately read a new e-mail with any file  attached download it to the hard disk and then delete it. The main idea is to keep the inbox free.You have to be sure and uncheck the "Email my answers" box after you have composed a question.just DELETE them.Through the use of folders. Create folders and store emails in them.  Unsubscribe to junk emails. Use the bulk mail folder. Check email often and delete unwanted emails.You could delete all of your emails as soon as you read them.  That will guarantee that the email box is empy.
As the previous person suggested, it could be caused by spyware.. . There is an in-built spyware scanner in the Yahoo Toolbar (indicated by a yellow and red cross-hair), called Anti-Spy. Open Anti-Spy, update it then begin your scan. If it finds anything it will give you options as to what to do.might be spyware causing that
If you really want to choose the picture that you display on answers, then open up a 360 account (which is free).  You can upload a photo or picture to your 360 account and choose to use that on yahoo answers.. . You can choose to change your picture by clicking on My Q&A, then clicking on Edit my Info and choosing a picture.I don't have a cartoon face. I have an actual picture. :)u go to ur Q&A then at like the top right above ur questions it says edit my info n u click on that then u chose w/e u want! :) o to get one like mine u click on ur avatar and if u don't have one yet then u would make one. =)when u signed up 4 questions they gave u that option
Check if u set the option of saving messages. And try to click the names u hv by the right click to see if there is a saved messages.yes, i know, once closed are for ever, and then when it's closed by mistake, all the messages are lost, and a very sad feeling comes on, but you can't do anything,yahoo has that drawback. u cannot save ur offline messages if you close them once they are lost. however i think you can try saving your chat histroy in your msngr and that will show them up. try it out and see. and while u r at it gimme 10 points
go to yahoo.com...search for download yahoo messenger...once downloaded,you will have there an option to email somebody instantly..that easy..please make sure that the person you are emailing to is also onlinelol it easy. just like 1 2 3.. just click instant message.
if you subscribe to mail plus, you can get aaccess to your y! Mail account from outlook (or other client based applications) and  "POP" your email such that it lives on the web and in your email client.  (when setting up your email client - like outlook - just make sure to check the box that says "leave copy on the server" that way when you download into outlook, you also leave a copy on the server.)if you are using outlook, it is easy go to file, archive and follow the wizard this wll allow you to archive to a .pst file and you can save it to a cd if you wish and open the pst just by chosing file, open, outlook data file and giving it the location of you .pst file.
does'nt matteryour avatar isnt exactly how you look, if thats what you mean. i tried to get mine as close to me as possible but its a little bit off. i guess if i were to be animaterd thats what we would look like:)And you should appreciate it!I know, shocking isn't it.....?Good for you, buddy.  Admitting it is the first step on your road to recovery.How about stupid because that is not a question.That's not a question.what I guess we don't know you but ok i'll just say you're hot !!!what?no, thats how you are/look!
Good answer from sunnylonge, though you could also right click on the toolbar and be able to uncheck it from the selection there.To completely remove Yahoo! Toolbar, click on the little pencil image on right of the big red Y. You should see a menu open with a list of options. Choose Uninstall Toolbar.To get rid of Yahoo! toolbar, go to and click on View, then select Toolbars, all working toolbars will be marked, unmark Yahoo! toolbar or whichever you dont want. The beauty of this is that you can select/mark it again when you want it back.yes that is true
You can change your nickname, but it won't show up to people on your friends list. Only if you go into a chat room can people see it. I think you go to properties or settings or something and change your nickname from there.Change the setting in MY ACCOUNTJUST CLICK ON OPTIONS I.E FOR YAHOO AND CLICK ON ACCOUNT INFORMATION. THERE U'LL SEE THE OPTION FOR EDITING UR ACCT INFORMATION EG UR DISPLAY NAME. HAVE FUNClick on Options from your yahoo mail window and then click on General Preferences.. I think the first option in that category is the name that is used when sending email.. . (essentially this name comes from the name you gave when you signed up for the account, but can be changed to protect your true identity)
I am thinking you mean when you are trying to add people to your address book. When you click on your mail page and then go to the address tab one of top choices should be add a contact and then the page should switch.  A new window does not pop up the page should completely change. If the page does not you can try sending a fake email to that person then after you send it it will ask you if you want to add it to your address book. Try doing it then.  I hope this helpsBecause thats the way it suppose to be.    See how silly that sounds as an answer???

I dont think at a time you can send. But you will have to send 6 invitations (Sharing) for 6 albums, one for each..Pack all the 6 albums into a single Folder, and Zip the folder : If the zipped-file is less than 10 MB in size, you can forward it along with a single mail !
You have the "Call" option located in the IM window (when you're talking to one of your friends). In order to use that, you need a microphone plugged in your computer.You gotta download the new yahoo messenger with voice and make sure you have a headset or a microphone with speakers and headphones.
Double click on the empty search box and a list of searches should appear (Internet Explorer) highlight one with your mouse and press the delete key.  Hold down the delete key and all the searches will be erased.my best guess try going into your pc's control panel under internet options delete cookies,files and history that is where all the web pages you visit are storedWOW! Jeremy S! thanks for that info! I didn't know it could be done THAT way! I dont know about anyone else...but I hope YOUR answer gets picked as the BEST ANSWER! I'll be giving you a THUMBS UP rating if it is! TYTools, Internet Options, Content, Auto Complete, Clear Forms.. .

Break their fingers?   LOL...Im kidding.  Use the mail block control thingy on Yahooooooooooo.You have to block their email address.  In Yahoo mail, you can go under the options and type in the address to block.on yahoo email choose options,click on mail options, and click blocked addresses and you go on from there.Add their email address to Blobk addresses. To do that you can go to mail options and click block adderesses and then type in thier address and then click block.. You can have up to 500 block addressesblock them.
Legal reasons, I'm sure.Outside of the US FIFA contest we have a FIFA competition going on for residents of Ireland, England, and Canada. Check out our blog about it. (http://blog.360.yahoo.com/blog-d8pH0dcoRKeB12yOcnUQp.9VCFos?bid=2507&yy=2006&mm=4 )Yahoo is centered in the US and soccer is rare compared to other sports here. In Europe there are a lot of different leagues so soccer's pretty commonplace.Because people who live across the street from the stadiums in Europe wouldn't be too excited about winning.As  global citizens I think we should all be entitled to enter all competitions from all over the world.yea i am so angry about that..they cater to foreigners before the united states.
You don't.  The page is put there by Yahoo - it's not something you have any control over other than to give Yahoo negatove feedback about the new page in the hope they keep the original one.Click on Tools > Internet Options > Delete cookies and temp files . Restart IE (internet explorer). The new yahoo page is a test page you are lucky if you get it I haven't seen it on my computer yet . If you delete your cookies and restart browser the old one . -should- appear again. Or you can use the feedback link on the top right hand corner of the new page
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^he is rightclick start, settings, control panel, click add/remove programs, select yahoo messanger, click remove. this will uninstall the program
Actually, this is a question I would also like to see answered by someone who is truly "in the know". And why have our group's members only been receiving a sporadic digest lately instead of at least daily?? What is going on? Does it have to do with the new non-Java settings at Yahoo?Could be but if your the owner you need to check the settings for your group!
your question this was good question but it deserves logical answer.. . they say America is liberal country you can talk free speech etc.. it looks its worse than Iraq in Saddam time.. dictators come in all forms and colors and nationalities.. . Welcome to the club of sensors ship and not so free speech...Are you sure they delete your question? As far as I know this is a free site, well of course there are rules regarding the contain of Q & A (read the Community Guidlines for more information). Or perhaps, no body answered your question and you didn't extend it when it's expired then, yes, it will be deleted automatically.Read the Yahoo regulations.Cause his Cook already, From Australia.......
The top ten lists say that they update daily, but that's not true.  They only update a few times a week.  If your number of best answers is still high enough with the next update, you'll be listed then.My first suspension is that this top ten list is calculated by rank and number of best answers. But maybe its just a bug.you get put in the top ten on a mondaybecause it undates every weekI don't know but they say that the list undates every week. Ask in "What's going on in Answers?" Maybe you get an answer.
Are you talking about the toolbar at the top of your screen?  Go to View and then toolbars and check or uncheck the ones you want and don't want accordingly.Are you talking about your Browser bar?  If so, what browser are you using?you need to send a email to yahoo. if the cant help with the problem you need to contact a computer teck or if you have a back up system on your computer you can make your computer go back in time to before the problem started to occure and the back up tool will bring to bring you computer back to its original state

from which country u r. If u r from usa only then u can do this with the help of skype.You need to download the latest 7.5 Messenger client at:. . http://beta.messenger.yahoo.com/download.php. . You'll then need to sign up for the Phone Out service at:. . http://voice.yahoo.com/There are a number of products that you can use to do this, including Yahoo! Messenger 7.5 with Voice (Beta), Skype, and Lycos Phone.. . Except for Lycos Phone (which currently comes with 100 Free minutes to start), none of these services are FREE for outbound calls, and there are charges involved without outbound calls as well as having a phone number that a land line can call you at.The most used product for this is skype.  You can get all the information at http://www.skype.com.. . While Vonage does not do exactly what you asked, it uses your internet connection and lets you make calls from a normal phone over the internet without paying toll charges.  Information about that can be found at http://www.vonage.com.i dont know how if i knew i woulden't ask
because they take away your questions for stupid reasons, they give you violations at the drop of a hat, and they just overall suck? is that a good answer?Sure I do, you've been reported one time too many and it has made you an angry chicken.I know why.http://answers.yahoo.com/info/community_guidelines.phpI know why, because you have alot of haters on here, and stalkers who want you on the grill! I got your back Chicken Boy!Your a chicken, and chickens don't have Questions&Answers. in the coop,just a lot of poop.......Im kinda starting to hate it, they take all the fun out of it, I think it would be funner to go to random places and just start asking random people odd questions, im getting sick of it here.what was the question again????????oh shut up fall out boy rocks it just an opinion i woudnt report u but i think u hate this site cause ur hate the yahoo staff for deleting good questionCause chickens dont belong on yahoo.Gorrilas,thats another story.They suck! They steal from us! Yeah, that's right! They rob us blindly!because you just can't stop no matter how yahoo pisses you offBecause you're a Chicken!!!!I know.
They are large files. If it was fast the broadband internet connections would not have a very good selling point.I have broadband cable and it is worth the money coz I couldn't stand to wait so long!no offense or anything but maybe its your computer speed. when i download audibles, it takes like 5 seconds but that's because my lap top is fast. maybe by increasing the speed of your computer some how, the audibles will download faster.
Believe it or not, everyone believes their opinion is the one that counts, so they answer in the hopes (those who answer seriously) that what they have to say helps the person asking the question.  But again, there are those who type in one or two letters, or a "LOL", just to get the two points given for answering in the first place.  And different opinions are always good...you can take advice from several to solve your problem/get your answer, or just go with the one that suits  you best!To put their two cents in. The more the merrier. why can't they answer the question, too? Who cares how many other people answered the question before hand? I don't. I still answer.I don't always notice how many prior answers there are.  Generally, I will only answer a question that has an adequate answer already if I think I have something to contribute.  I try not to spend time answering where there is little chance my answer will be selected as best.I guess it depends on the question.  Sometimes the question just invites a lot of participation.  Sometimes none of the intial answers have given a full accounting for a really good answer.  Sometimes some more relevant references might answer the question better.. . And, sometimes, people just want the two points.  If they spent the time answering something really well, then they might have a chance at 60 points for a best answer, but they're heppy with the 2 points. Go figure.. . And, yes, you can earn up to 60 points per best answer.Why are you so dumb?  :)I think it is because you get the chance to get voted as best answer and get more points, but i might be wrong.Because they are ignorant and they think they know the answer. OR they are even more ignorant and try to argue with previous answers because they are ignorant and think they are right. By the Way i am very ignorant. And the person who responds below me is even way more ignorant. Hope that clears things up :). . Yours Truley,. Mr. IgnorantWhat you have to say is just as important as everyone else's opinions and experiences. You never know what may happen if you just express what you have to say. I have answered some where I was in the 20s and was chosen for best answer.I don't know about other people/computers, but sometimes when I start answering it says "be the first to answer" but by the time I'm done, lots of other answers are there ahead of me.Also, some people just want to give smart-a.ss answers and insults just because they can.They may think they have a better answer.  Would you rather have your question ignored?  I like lots of answers.  Putting in your 2 cents, gets you 2 points.Maybe they think they have a better answer
For undecided question, they don't want people to pick answer based on their ID or if they know the person, so it gives equal opportunity to all answerer's.(Like answer team, most of the time people want to pick their answer as best even though sometimes its NOT).so that your opinion is impartial and you dont vote for people you know or yourself,to avoid favoritism or even cheatingThat's only when voting for a best answer....and as far as I know it's always been that way.I assume it's do you don't vote based on WHO wrote the answer but the CONTENT of the answer.I guess it's so you don't know who answered the question and therefore you can't vote for a favorite person.  It only happens when a question is In Voting.That happens when you have to choose the best answer for your question, I think so that people are judging completely on the answer.
Yahoooooooooo, has instant messaging and it's freee tooo. You have go into the top right corner of your computer once you have yahoo and go where it has the words yahoo messenger and click that and then go into the part where it has the words "DOWNLOAD " AND DO THAT AND THEN YOU HAVE INSTANT MESSAGING ON YOUR COMPUTER !!You have to click the messenger link and then download it.It depends on the instant messenger client you wish to use. For the sake of example (and to get brownie points with Yahoo! Answers), I'll use Yahoo! Messenger.. . 1) Find the link to the download page and click on the link.. 2) Download the client to one of the drives of your computer, or just the one you have.. 3) Get an account on the IM client's service, if you haven't already. In the case of Yahoo! Messenger, if you have a Yahoo! account, you're already good to go.. 4) Begin IM'ing! LOL and ROFL away to your delight.You go to the website below and then you just follow the instuctions they tell you!
Well if you ask a question, which you just did, it costs 5 points.  You can get points by answering questions, voting on pending best answers, giving a best answer (someone says they like your answer the best within 24 hours of close), giving a closed item a thumbs up or down, or after 24 hours of posting your own question giving out a best answer award.2 pts answer a question. 1 pt vote for best answer. 1 pt rate a best answer. -5 ask a questionAnswer all the questions you know the answers to and maybe get a few best answers along the way.. Answer=2 pts. Best answer=10. Rate a resolved best answer=1. Once a day-visiting=1top rite hand of the screen. ''Whats going on in Answers''. . click on it,it explains everything.good luck.2 points -Answer questions. 1 point  -Rate answers-thumbs up or thumbs down .           (u can do this by clicking discover). 10 points- U get rated as a "best answer"If you ask a question you lose 5 points. If you answer a question you gain 2 pts. If your answer is chosen as the best answer you get 10 pts. You get one point for voting on questions that have already been answered and 1 pt for a thumbs up vote either for your best answer or someone elses. You get 1 pt for logging on but only 1 time per day.answer questions gives you 2 points.  just click on the amount of points you have and it Will show you how you get pointsAnswer questions. You'll get 2 points. Thanks.You simply ask questions like this now..... and VOILA..!  I get 2 ponts for this.. . . (for more info check this yahoo's Point System)yep, tat's it.you read it before you signed on---correct?Well this was an Easy 2 pts for me...U just answer questions!!!Answer questions = 2 points. Take the time to answer them well may = 10 points.. Bottom line, take the time to answer what you know and your giving back while being rewarded to ask for more help on those topics of interest to you.You don't ask too many questions yourself, but answer a TON of other people's questions.  I don't care about points, I just like the social aspect, and hearing people's insight on various subjects.. . Answers: +2 points. . Questions: -5 points
Sometimes it's because the question is too difficult or specific, like you said.  Other times it's because the person asking the question wants a real person's opinion, or they want a bunch of different answers, so in a way, they get to pick the one they like best.  I think people post on here for opinions, like you did. =)Either they don't know how to do an internet search (idiots) or they want someone else to do the legwork for them (lazy bums).    I think answering them is an opportunity to practice my reference librarian skills.The first answer is of course Yes, using a web search engine is easier and very effective in many cases. . . However, I meet lots of people everyday, in "real life", who don't know how to search. Some are not aware of the special search tools, and some are like my mum, who expects to get exactly what she needs just by typing a word in the search box :-P and of course, gets easily discouraged when she doesn't.. . In addition, I guess Yahoo Answers is about more than just data. When I give an answer, even if it is for a fact-based question, I try to include some personal input, a link to related concepts, or just an opinion. That makes the contents of the answer richer than what wikipedia or google could provide. . Of course, when people answer by copying and pasting a wiki article, this whole concept of Y!Answers gets lost :-/maybe because they couldn't find them on the internet so they try to find the answers hereBecause they are bored and they have nothing else to doiF YOU SEEM SO AGAiNST iT, WHY ARE YOU USiNG iT?I agree, there are plenty of questions that could easily have been googled.  I speculate the askers of those particular questions are either lazy, ignorant or just looking for some sort of human response or attention.I do ALOT of internet research but some things can be easily overlooked including key word searchesyou are getting opinions of people from all over the world who all have different views on everything.It's addicting...it's like a internet drug, it pulls us back.because we are lazy, and sometimes its just easierB/C ASKING A ? HERE GIVES THE ASKER ANSWERS FROM PEOPLE WHO HAVE GONE THROUGH THE SAME OR SIMILIAR SITUATION.I wonder that myself - it would be way easier to go to google or any other search engine than to post a question and not even know for sure if the answer is right or wrongdon't get me to lyin', but i'll tell u this:. because of it, I'm sneaking up on level 5....lol  :)maybe because they are lazy.Cause and Affect. Cause they to stupid to figure it out!. And Affect(ion) for human responce.I ask questions and answer them for that matter, because I like a good debate.  I am more curious about how people will respond to my questions than I am the actual answers.  I answer questions because I want to offer the asker a new way to look at things.People are lonely and this is a way of socialising.
If you can remember the zipcode,alternate email,date of birth and secret question you may be able to get it back. If the email hasnt been touched for over 3 months it will have to be reactivated any way if or when you are able to re-sign in. Yahoo no longer sends out your new password in emails they stopped doing that about 3-4 years ago as a security measureNo, there is no way that you can retrieve that e-mail account back. If you dint you your e-mail account in some specific time, I think its 90 days. It's automatically get deletedIf you remember your email ID, you can still try by logging in help.. But, since it is 1997? You can just log in, and i guess your email provider had cleared all your mails. MSN clears my inbox when i hadnt log in for only 1 month.. So sorry.
Probably because ships need lots of air to float.  Once you create a hole, lots of water leaks in and slowly sinks the ship as it floods each part.Obviously, once you get hole you'll sink!
i figure it is because they are either tobusy to get back to it, are new to this hole thing, or just dont care since they had already (or not) gotten the correct answers. i have actually done it before too, and my reason was for being new and not knowing any better...and i kinda didnt care.This's life ; take it or leave it !A lot of the questions are asked by people who don't have daily access to a computer. Students ask them in the computer labs at school, others use the public libraries or other sources to go online. Some have friends who grudgingly share theirs for a few minutes. If they created the account the same day they asked the question, then lost the log-in info they may have no way to get back on to deal with the question. Capiche? Those are just off the top of my head. Bet if you really try you can think of others, as well, instead of blaming laziness, lack of responsibility, and plain not caring. Chill out and remember, this is all pretty new to a lot of people.Well we have busy lives and forget sometimes. I have voted on those forgotten answers so i know they are there. If someone doesn't care about what we have to say then i guess they just are not normal because we as other yahooians give great advice. So i would advise u to give these people a break and don't worry about them anymore :-)Better questions come to their mindI know hey! whenever i answer a question,normally the asker never chooses a best answer,even if the ansers are really good. i always try my best to give the best answers i can,otherwise what is the point of answering at all right? if a person asks a question because they need advice or whatever, surely they want good answers,so they should always give the best answer the recognition it deserves!yes because they are interested in just posting a question ythey are not at all ready to choose the best answer for .Just see at the questions... do you feel like answering it? many of the are just to be ignored. Sincere people will never forget the question and see the advice given.I think some of the people are not forgetting to pick a best answer, but really do not know the right answer, so they are counting on Yahoo people to choose the correct one. Some of the people just post a question because they are bored, so they try to think up a reasonable question that they think will get a large response.  They are not doing it for the answers that they will get, They are  trying to think of the best question and therefore they use up some of their spare time.  When you post a question, as you know, You can have the answers sent to your email address, so you do not even have to go back to the question itself.The answer lies in your question itself, THEY FORGET IT, it may be because of their bad memory. OR out of laziness.If they get an answer they want on the first hit, they may just forget to go back.  Then, too, many factual questions have only one answer.  How many people does it take to answer "42."  In math, we can add how we arrived at it, but that's probably going to be done early on.  . . Then, too, in the purely factual, who's going to bother to vote on it unless they know they answer?  Only a point-grabber who is only doing it for points. . . And points is really far secondary to the quality of answers we get to the questions we really want answered.. . Then, too, probably a lot of people sign on, don't really get interested, and never sign on again to see the answer.  I'm sure this is true of people who get questions rejected for obscenity or obvious solicitation.  Those, too, are not what this site is about.. . This site is about what a magical tool communication can be when it is done with good manners.  That's really all "Community Guidelines" says; have good manners, and ask any question you want.  They have put a lot of thought into how to categorize questions, and I'm sure that will get tweaked, but basically, what we are doing when we beta test in this case is testing the social factors; the "Community Guidelines."That is called just plain laziness. It drives me crazy!maybe they are not as keen as you just getting points?It's easier to forget a question or leave it to someone else to vote on. Then the asker doesn't feel they're offending anyone. . . Anyone who truly does wish to keep track of their questions can look in "My Q&A" where they are tracked.
First make sure that that nobody happend to change your Yahoo! settings (say while you were away from your desk , etc.).. . Second, send an e-mail to yourself, and see how the From Looks.Could you give us a bit more information? How is it offensive? What email program do you use? Who created the account for you?some mailing prog,s when u click send ,check the e mail reciever with ur adress list ,if it dos,nt found in the list act such behavior,so try 2 send me message but add me first in ur adress list ,if it successfully send it s ok. if not click :HELP; IN THE MAIL PROG.it took u 2  F A Q.search the answer of ur prob there.thats all.
press forward to click the mailIf I think I understand the question correctly, you'd like to know how to forward e-mail directly from the inbox, without reading the messages (as if to forward a large amount of messages).  If that is the case, unfortunately, you're not able to do that.   You would have to forward each message individually.In every web page/inbox page of urs u will find an option at the bottem/upperline  "forward" from that option u can do it easly.click 'forward'There should be a button that reads. Forward message or just Forward. Then type in the new address. If that does not work im not really sure thenYou really do have to take the trouble to forward each message individually.Now all you have to do is, open your e-mail,take the option fwd, then type in the names of people who you want to forward it to....As simple as that....Got me?Or you have 2 other options.. 1)ask someone else to forward it.. 2)dont forward it.. Any way, All the best!!!!
you can't, yahoo feels that, to get the best answers and give others a chance to answer, you should keep the question open for a day or more (just try to, it will give you a message similar to this). if you want people to stop answering, you could delete the question, but then the question is gone, so, just wait a few hours and you can choose a best answer or send it to a voteYou cannot. Once a question has been asked it must remain open for a full 24 hours before it can be closed. This allows more people an opportunity to answer your question, and gives you more answers.
100. "You may send the same mail message to up to 100 people at one time."i think its unlimited,  i know i sent emails to like ovre 100 people for school once
To help keep underage kids from being attacked by online predators and other weird people out there.Too much potential for kids to post too much information and wind up getting in trouble.  Less liability for Yahoo! this way.  That, and they may even actually care about your safety.sometimes when under 18 you have a lot to learn and the internet can be more dangerous for you then you think,I am 46 and was stalked by a man pretending to be 26 and needed my help at college,it cost me a lot of money and fear for my life,it was hell on wheels,play on here,don't give much information out about yourself coz there are too many weirdos in this world,be careful online!cause they think you'll do stupid stuff, . just say your 18 change the bdayyeah, what they said

Must be because AOL has one. But I am not sure about it.Yes - you can download messenger.yahoo.com and then you can look under the preferences menu - and there is a whole menu on sounds and alerts.  You can set it up so that every time you get a new email in your SBC Y! Mail account - you get an alert / sound - whatever you pick (you can even upload your own sound)NOT POSSIBLE!there should already be one on there you must have shut something offI don't think there is one in SBC mail, but if you are logged into Yahoo Messenger, You can set the preference under the Alerts tab to play a sounds when you get a new mail message.  It work when you are invisible as well.

After messenger has opened goto. FILE - SIGN OUT . then sign in with your other handle - this new handle MUST already exist. Oh, here's a tip for free, you can also use WINDOWS MESSENGER at the same time so have 2 handles active at onceThe good thing is, you can actually be on both at the same time!!!!  You can use your downloaded messenger to log on 1 ID and use web messenger like www.e-messenger.com to log in another ID.    . . There's another way that you can be on by being online on 1 messenger.  And that is incorporate 1 of your id to the other one.  The disadvantage of this is that, you will only have 1 email address but two IDs.  So, it's like you have 2 profiles in 1 account.  That's what I did.  If for example your friend will send you an email using your secondary id, you won't be able to get it since it only recognize the primary email address.  But your friends can send instant mesages on both IDs though.  If you choose this, you will lose the emails that you had on the secondary id since you need to close the account and then make a new profile on the other ID.  . . Just think it over what's best for you.  . . 1.) is 2 ids with 2 emails using 2 messengers (downloaded and the web messenger).. 2.) 1 email address with 2 or even more IDs and be online at the same time on 1 messenger.  you can even choose to make 1 profile inactive at any time. . . If you don't mind switching from one ID to another, Make sure you sign-out first before you sign-in to the other ID.  . . Hope this helps!You should be  able to sign out from one ID and then sign back in w/ your other ID and password. We have 3 ID's that use messenger on our pc. Good Luckyou have to sign out of first account, wait a minute, then sign in as different user..works every time
In Mail, click the Compose button. On the Compose page click the Attach Files button (below the subject line). Find the file you want to attach and click OK. It will be attached to your message when you send it.on the compose page, click where it says "attach files" and browse to the file you want to send.use a pin or a clampthere will be a button that says "attach file" on the left side near the send buttongenerally, there's a button reading "attach" or "insert file". browse from there to the item you want attached. it's not hard. look around. there's also a button reading "send". if you click that, your message will mail. it's odd but i think it's going to be a big hitYeah forex is right!Go to mail.yahoo.com. Sign up. Then go to compose. There you will see the icon "Attach Files." After you got there, click on the "Browse" icon.  After, select the file you need and click open (you can attach up to 5 files).  Then click "Attach file" on the top or bottom (it is going to take awhile to attach). When you see the name of the attached file, you may send the E-Mail.At the top of the page near send there is a button that says attach.
Thank -you for the politeness.But you aren't going anywhere.So just be bored like the rest of us and answer some questions.lolThe only way to do so is to stop using the account. After 6 months it will be deleted.why.
You got to start over again. Just forward all your mail into your new accountu can do this by getting a new ID only.
if u have messenger with voice u would probably be better off keeping them on ur list and putting ur status to permanently invisible so they dont ever think u are online ... i hate when ppl i dont like IM me grrr!! i know ur frustrations ..click your freinds list, then when you find that person right click and click delet.(i did not try this but im sure it will work.all you have to do is block them. That will prevent them fron talking to you. Then when you want to un block them you can do that whenever you want.What I have done before is leave them on your list and go to the preferences in yahoo messenger and go to the ignore section. Add that persons id to the ignore list.  I did it and it worked but if they change their id then they will be able to contact you.delete them and then block them, they wll however know that they have been deleted....
Hope this helps you with what you neededhttp://www.readnotify.com/default.asp/from/gleemltrknJust check in the sent option and you`ll come to know.By calling them and asking if they received it. The only other way is if you have a e-mail provider that lets you know if an e-mail has been opened or not.it should save in sent messeages, if not call them and ask them or ask them when you see them!AOL mail you can check if other AOLers have opened your mail.  Otherwise, there isn't a way...well there probably is, but it's most likely illegal.
on the booting out thing ... I've heard that some users have programs that they use to boot others out. I guess they think it's funny or something.I think when too many people are in the chat room you can sound times get booted out.  Every room has a quote to ensure efficency.
Answer questions.  Be honest.  Being honest doesn't win points, but you are more likely to be picked best answer if you you answer knowledgeably.rate best answers, get chosen for best answers, or don't get any. whats the point of getting points anyway?2 points at a time, then best answer if the questionnaire guy likes your answer.

asking about medical conditions only you and your doctor should know about is too personal to me.Remember that you're asking the Yahoo! Answers community, which is for all intents and purposes, like asking the world.  If the question is something that you don't want to ever have associated with you, then don't ask it.  . . You do have the option of anonymity by hiding your 360 links and IM details (max privacy is set by default when you join).  Just keep in mind that any questions you ask can be linked to your profile in Yahoo! Answers since anyone can see all the questions and answers you have ever asked.I think as long as the question is appropriate, nothing is too personal to ask.  Isn't that what answers is for?  As long as you are keeping yourself fairly annonymous....if you tell your name, age or anything personal thats to personal!!!!!!!!!!Depends on the person.That would highly depend upon the person that you are asking.  Different people are sensitive to different subjects.. . Some do not like discussions about religion. Some do not like discussions about sex. Some do not like personal questions from strangers (unless they are interested in persuing a relationship). . Then there are those that will answer any question you pose just because they want to feel special.. . Pretty much, if you feel comfortable asking then ask.  If you do not get an answer to your satisfaction, either ask another question to draw it out, or realize that person did not want to answer.If you ask yourself if it's too personal, it probably is.  If you'd be even slightly uncomfortable answering, it probably is too.
log into email, at the top(or bottom) of each email their should be a "forward button" click that.  Then the screen changes and you enter in the information such as email address you are sending it to, subject, etc. Then click sendWhen forwarding a message, you can forward either as an attachment or as inline text. If you forward as an attachment, your recipient will need to save or open the attachment in order to view the message. If you forward as inline text, the text of the message will appear quoted within the body of the message that you send, set off by ">" characters on the left margin. . To forward a message which itself includes an attachment, choose the "Attachment" option rather than "Inline Text." Forwarding as an attachment will preserve the whole of the original message, including all of its attachments. . . To forward a message, begin by opening the message on your screen. When you have the message open: . . Choose whether you would like to forward the message as an attachment or as inline text by clicking the down arrow on the "Forward" button and selecting "As Inline Text" or "As Attachment". . . Click the "Forward" button. This will open a Compose Mail window. If you have chosen to forward as an attachment, the Compose Mail window will be blank. If you have chosen "Inline Text," the Compose Mail window will contain the text of the forwarded message. . . In the To:, Cc:, and Bcc: fields, enter the email addresses of your intended recipients. . . In the message window, type any additional text you would like to include. . . Click the "Send" button. . *If you would like to set inline text as your default rather than attachment, click the Click the "Mail Options" link located on the top-right side of the mail main page, choose "General Preferences" scroll down to the Forwarding header, and select "Inline Text." Be sure to click the "Save" button at the bottom of the Preferences window to put your new settings into effect.
go to tools, internet options, privacy, and then look at the bottom to see if there's a check in the box . . that's probably why... or unless there's something wrong with your computer.Try getting a Mozilla Firefox, it really works.

If you did not enter it then you did not win.  I'd say there is about a 99.999% chance that it is an outright fraud. Don't even reply to it, that only confirms your address.  Delete that thing as fast as you can.Here's some signs of a lotto scam:. . *You never paid money or bought a ticket to enter.. *Your "winning" notification is probably not personalized.. *Your "winning" notification came by email, probably from a free email address such as yahoo.com or msn.com.. . If you answer the email, after one or two email exchanges with the so-called "lottery officials" or "claims agent," perhaps accompianied by some official looking but fake documents, you'll be asked to pay fees for "taxes" or "handling" or some other reason. This is the scam - you pay the fees and never see any winnings, mainly because there are none to see.They are all frauds. If you didn't enter the lottery, you can't win. This is a scam that takes people for all of their money. Ignore it. Go to www.snopes.com for more informationIf you didn't enter it, the contest is a fraud. Watch out for viruses!  DELETE IT!There are thousands of scams out there just trying to get you to respond... remember - If you don't buy a ticket - you can't win.Delete  themJust Reply To Their Email. That Doesnt Cost you Rite.. So if it is fraud you'll get to know and if not you'll get your prize.. Go Ahead!!!
When he cant look you straight in the eyes, the tone of his voice changes, blames you for cheating on him, avoiding confrontation/(you), not being constant with his answers. That's how you can tell if your man is lying!!!whenever u want to check if someone is lieing or not, get him counterchecked thru the source about him, u feel he might be lieing.he doesn't look you straight in the eyes, the tone of his voice seems guilty, blames you for cheating on him, avoiding youASK HIM SOME POINT BLANK QUESTIONS AND SEE IF HE IS LYING AND THEN CHECK UP ON THEM ANSWERS .......... TEST HIM IS ANOTHER THING THAT YOU CAN DO CALL HIM OR ASK A CLOSE FRIEND TO PRETEND TO BE A GIRL TRYIN TO HOOK UP WITH HIM AND SEE IF HE SAYS ANYTHING AT ALL ABOUT IT?if you feel that he is lying then most of the time you know
Usually I've found that the default setting has some notification sound, but you can got to Preferences in Messsenger and set it on. Even select the type of sound you prefer.From the Messenger Menu select preferences. Select Alerts & Sounds in the left pane. You will see a checkbox "Enable alert sounds", first make sure that is checked. . Secondly you will see a list of Messenger events, like "A messenger contact goes offline". Select each of these and then you can customize what happens for each event. You can display a dialog, play a sound or other things. For playing a sound you can use the pre-packaged sounds that come with messenger or use your own .wav files.In the main messenger window choose the "Messenger" menu and select "Preferences".  Click on the category "Alerts & Sounds" in the left side pane.  You can customize various audio alerts from there.
Answer very well & accurately or be really funny without being mean.  Still depends on what the questioner is looking for as it's the questioner's decision on who to vote as best answer.Just like what everybody else said, answer a question and hope and pray that either the asker or voters pick yours as the best and then you get a fast and easy 10 points to add to your scoreboard.If you give someone a really good answer then they might choose you for a best answer.You answer a question the best that you can. The asker after a set period of time gets to select what he/she thinks is the best answer. If he/she selects your answer as best answer you get ten points. If he/she does not make any selections then it is put out to vote. At this point the viewers get to vote on best answer. Again the answer that is selected will get ten points.yes, .......i think that's rightanswer an obscure question that hasn't received any attention for a while. wait for it to go into voting then vote for yourself. you might even get lucky enough to have someone vote for you as well. then you will be chosen as best answer by voters. so you will get two points for answering, one point for voting, and ten points for best answer.When u get picked as da best ans, dats da only way.Sorry. Good Luck.Get the best answer.... . if u answer me u may get it...;oDby writin the best answerBy having your answer chosen as the best one!answer a question really well, and get chosen as the best answer, thats the only way.when u answer a question n ur answer gets picked as the best answerChecked my answer and I will show u thatanswer questions with good answers! That'll get you 12 points overall (2 for answering, and 10 for getting selected as the best answer). . Failing that, try answering 5 questions!
Just highlight the part that you want to send then hit "Ctrl" & "C".  Compose your email and in body of the email (where you normally type what you want) Make sure the curser is in the body and then hit "Ctrl" & "V"  Then you will just have what you want to send to your friends and family without all the other "forwards."Delete the parts of the email that you don't want to forward.Copy the joke/message into a new email, then send it on.Click your left mouse key while scolling through unwanted text, so that it highlights info that you're wanting to delete.  With unwanted text highlighted, click "Delete".  That way your e-mail is cleaned-up, and all your left with is your own message and reply:)
u have to be european to like summer and go to the beach?? I mean I am, but millions arent, and do!When else to go to the beach.Most of Europe,at least northern Europe is miserable in the long winter,cold,rain,snow,winds and so on when the short summer comes every body runs for the sun and a lot of Europians work the whole year to be able to go to ,Italy,Spain,Portugal or the French riviera ,to adore the sun and be near naked near the beach.I'm British and in summer its so warm it stops raining most the time.So we go too the beach because that's were the holiday stuff is like fairgrounds, pubs, nightclubs, arcades, hotels and sand to sit on and relax with the kids. It started in the Victorian times when the first train travel opened up the country so people could go some were on holiday with there money as the government had made it illegal for employers not to give thier workers any weeks off.because they are europeans

i was wondering the same thing. maybe we want to go up so we will finally know. or we get an upgrade of your choice like laser eyes and demons that fly out your butt to devour your enemy.It's fun.there is no point, but then we all do pointless things all the timePeople are naturally competitive.Its the new Mount Everest!
Get in the fight a couple of times. Bring rats to school.Y would you want to?  Just stay in school until u graduate, everyone wins, unless theres something im missing.claim that your sick and stay home, miss to many days and they wont let you come back! if being sick doesnt work then claim that you have an important project that you need to stay home for, then say your sick the next day! It works! I know from some experience! or be late all the time then eventually they will expell you! or you could just stick through it you only have a month til summer!divorce your parents or just move out otherwise there is no way your parents wont have a reactionSmoke weed in class, lite something on fire, pull the fire alarm every other hour, take a dump on the principals desk, moon your teacher, smash the trophy case, lite fireworks off in the gym, punch your most disliked teacher, scream profanity extremely loudly at random, say you set up bombs around the school, bring a airsoft gun to school that looks real, bring one of those comb switchblades and threaten a student or teacher with it then pop the comb out lol, smash a bunch of the windows, through your desk across the room, hijack a school bus, hijack a school bus then drive it into the front of your school, stand up and take a piss on the people infront of you at an assembly, crap in your hand and throw it at people, join band and use your instrument as a bong or crack pipe.. . Just be creative man!your a dumbass...why get kicked out of school is your goal in life to be a loser???? Stay in school! I know it sucks but it is so worth it!!! You will regret it if you don't!you better have a great relationship with your parents already because you'll be living in thier house for the rest of your life if you can't finish your schooling. if you won't be kicked out for a while, start kissing up now. do WHATEVER it takes to make them feel good. wash the dishes daily, pick up the dog doo, scrub the showers with a toothbrush, massage your mother's corns.. if you're being kicked out soon and your relationship with your parents is iffy, panic.Why do you want to get kicked out of school so you will only ever be able to find low paying, menial employment.. Surely finishing school so you can get a job that pays enough money so you can have a decent life is more important than doing the pointless stuff you want to do now instead of schooluhhh, they won't kill you, but they will definitely find out no matter what if you get kicked out and get mad at you.Be so smart they advance you all the grades.You don't.why get kicked out. Why don;t you make a good effort at school and make your parents proud of you. you will be glad you did later in life, when you are the one with a job and money, and all your so called loser mates are on the dole or in prison.. who will have the street cred then?. honestly, sorry to sound so dull and parent like, but success is yours if you make an effort.If it's a catholic school - find somebody to be gay with. You're parents may disown you if they're hardcore catholic though..That woldn't be smart.......don't do it.Don't be silly, you should be putting all your efforts into your studies rather than getting kicked out of school. Your school days are the best days of your life, trust me on that one.Why would you want to get kicked out of school? It's imperative to finish and get your diploma. A GED, while equivalent, just won't have the same effect on you or impact on prospective employees that a diploma will. The pride alone, of accomplishing graduation, is the greatest feeling.. . And let's face it, there's really no way to get kicked out (expelled) without your parents knowing it and possibly killing you.. . I wish you luck and hope that you'll reconsider your future. There really is one out there even if it's clouded from your point of view, for whatever reason. :) You have to believe in you.Not possible. Can't have one without the other.Have your parents sign over your rights (to be legel for everything ya do... that is if your still a minor, which it sounds like ya still are), then move out and drop out of school. Just make sure ya have a place to go before all of that happens...Why would you want to get kicked out in the first place?? You might as well drop out. Your parents are going to be pissed regardless.man....your mind is sick....There is no way to get kicked out of school without your parents being very upset, unless they really are uncaring, in which case that is a very sad situation. . Best try not to do it...YOU DO NOT HAVE THAT MANY DAYS LEFT KID JUST DEAL WITH ITSORRY MATE THERE IS NO WAY WITHOUT BEING KILLED BY UR PARENTS!!!!Tell them you have emotional problems then proceed to flagellate yourself indiscriminately while speaking in tongues.Sorry, I would kill you too if you got kicked out of school.I assume the term "kill" in this context is a figure of speech. If it's not run for your life.Set off Crickets in the auditoriom while its full.  Worked for my friend.

RESTART and all will be fine, Mr. WINDOWS !!!Is this the MSN Messenger? If there are a couple of things you should kknow. First MSN is a product of Microsoft. It is used for the .Net Passport, which is used for many differnat programs within the Microsoft network. For example, Hotmail, MSN Messenger, Microsoft Updade, Microsoft Help and Support, Microsoft Courses, and many other services are reached by the .Net Passport. Usually your Hotmail address is called your .Net Passport "Credentials" which allows you to sign in and have access to the many differant services the Microsoft Network provides. It also provides access to message boards. . . However, the is another messenger created by Microsoft and it is in your computer, connected to Outlook and/or Outlook Express. If you have Internet Explorer you have the Windows Messenger as well. Windows Messenger is a part of Outlook Express and comes bundled with the browser.. . While signing up for Hotmail it is possible to accidently activate Windows Messenger as well. I know as I did this with my last computer myself. I would consistantly get these messages that I was being signed out of MSN Messenger as I had been signed in at another location. The "other location" is another location on the Microsoft Network, and is specifically from Windows Messenger being activated in some manner.. . My problem occurred during my sign up for a .Net Passport while creating my account on my new computer. While signing up you are given an option of using an address you already own or have the exclusive use of. I had an account through my ISP which at that time was SBC. However, when I tried to use that address with the .Net Passport Wizard it gave me an error message stating that address was owned by somebody else and I could not use it. I spent a long time trying to get that address accepted but it never was. So, I then went and put in another address I created on the spot but I used a .net at the end of the Hotmail account when Hotmail uses .com. It eccepted the address, but when I went to sign in using that address to "authenticate" it, I was locked out of that account due to Hotmail not using .net at the end of addresses. Which I find strange as it is called the .Net Passport which leads one to believe you need a .net at the end of the address, right? . . I ended up creating another address using .com, I just changed the other address from .net to .com and it was accepted, I validated it as mine, got my Hotmail account, downloaded the MSN Messenger and thought everthing was fine. Untill I began having these messeges stating I had been signed out and back in somewhere else. . . This problem was never really resolved for me. I was instructed to just resign in with the credentials I regularly use each time this occurred. So, I would have to occassionly get disconnected a few moments while I reconnected again. I just worked with the situation untill I got a new computer and made sure to use my existing Hotmail credentials, and not activate Windows Messenger. So far so good.. . Hopefully somebody here will have the second part of this answer for you, and that is how to get Windows Messneger de-activated. Even the Dell Techs at the Dell Help Desk could not get this fixed for me, nor did Microsoft Knowlege base help either, or the techs at Microsoft return my e-mails in regard to this issue. . . Good luck in getting this fixed. If you can't just do what I did, quickly enter your regular address and click "connect" and you are reconnected.. . Hopefully Microsoft will address this issue at some point. If they have already addressed it, they should make the task of finding the answer much easier.It's a security feature, just log back on.Restart

I agree, there seemed a glitch here in YA a few days ago. My 360 stopped showing then, and I cannot get it to show now.. . But ... a simple workaround... simply put the URL for your 360 into the "Comments" section of your YA profile (like I've done).  Seems to have exactly the same effect.try help on QnA and YAHHOO 360.At the moment the link in your about description is:. .   http://360.yahoo.com/imrational. . Change it to . .   http://360.yahoo.com/im.rational. . You could try checking the box that says: Show link to my Yahoo! 360 page in your Answers profile.Check my Answers profile. Answers has a glitch at the moment you have to copy paste  your 360 URL into your profile as the 360 link isn't showingI agree with Nudist...one dot makes all the difference...or just copy and paste your 360 link in your profile or comments. But neither is fool proof that you will have more visitors to your page...They have to be curious enough.... . ******. . I also checked your 360, but not by following any link...your first blog is about 2 weeks ago.

I've sent and recieved ordinary email with accents in Yahoo email without a problem.The reader's e-mail has to understand what you send. Have the person set up a yahoo email and then email their regular email with a message you sent them mail to the yahoo
The oceans contain some of the deepest points on Earth.  The Marianna Trench  "has a maximum depth of 10,911 m (35,798 feet) below sea level".Since it's the sea, I guess it couldn't be below sea level...  Good question!well would it b a sea then? lol
Maybe they didn't like the answer they got.. . Hehe....I like how you have the point system figured out thoughThere are a few different reasons.. . One would be that the person who asked the question doesn't want it to show up in his/her profile, and the only way to get rid of it is to delete the question while it is still open.. . Another reason would be that the question got many poor answers also, and the asker is sick of receiving notification emails about them.. . Once I deleted a question simply because the answerer copied and pasted from Wikipedia without crediting it properly. In that case, I didn't want to give the person credit but realized the question probably wouldn't be answered any better.. . It's also possible that the asker found the answer on his/her own and didn't even bother to look at the good answers recieved but just deleted it.. . Some people don't know about the points system, and some aren't concerned about a measly five points. Different people have different reasons. If you had a good answer you want to share, though, try doing an advanced search for similar questions to see if there's one you can add your answer to.well Sandy, what if you only got really stupid answers.... or non at all???Unsure of themselvesif u have an answer, u dont need the question up anymore
You can only delete your open questions. Once a question has been resolved we save it so that other people can search for the answers to the question.You can only delete unresolved questions. There's a button inside the question towards the right that says delete question.say something very racist,ilegal and sexualy explicit,and yahoo will do it for youit says "x" Delete Question on the rite side of the paige under Extend Expiration ...Click on your question and on the side it will say Delete Question.
Hey, you need to go to "My Page" in 360, then "Share Photos" .... and set THERE to access your Flickr stuff (AND/OR your "Yahoo" photos too, if you have any).. I hope that helps.. . And another thing.... It sometimes can (used to anyway) take a few hours for your Flickr on 360 to show up... so be patient.You account may be public but your Flickr photo's may not be. Flickr has it's own privacy levels (each pic can be set as public,private or Flickr friends only). 360 just shares Flickr and Y photo's it doesn't set the privacy levels for them you have to go into Flickr and make sure the pics are public on Flickr (and Y photo's) or otherwize they won't showDid you upload your yahoo photos into your new flickr account?  I did that and then chose "public".  Afterward go to your 360 page, click "share photos" and then flickr.  I will warn you that flickr will upload your yahoo photos in reverse order.  Did mine anyway which I found very frustrating.i am currently having this same problem and i am getting that same message...did you get this resolved?
don't know.... it's very strange though, you should be able to get it from yahoo.. Try it again...best place to download Y! Messenger is messenger.yahoo.com. If it refuses to install, can you provide the exact error message which you see? This could help to resolve your problem.Go to TOOLS menu-Internet Options-Security. Then Change Security Levels to lower level. But before making any changes write down the original settings. After installing Yahoo! Messenger set the Security Levels to its original settings.. . Your FIREWALL or ANTI-VIRUS software could block some modules or DLL files. Since you are downloading from Yahoo! your are safe.if you are missing a file, then you need to find out what file you are missing and download that file or no version you have will work. . . If you have tried different locations to download and you still get the same error, make sure you have all the appropriate software required to use yahoo messenger.download it from www.sotfpedia.com. search it and then download
It makes no difference does it now?. I mean, it's not like they are worth anything1Because they want you to keep asking and asking and keep coming back cos' it works for them.They would just then scale the levels up so it wouldn't make a difference.well it is a relatively new deal.  i guess they want to see how it works and how active people are.Cool chick..if it happens then healthy competition diminishes...Because then it'd be too easy to level up!One day, these points may be worth something (like loyalty points); in the meantime you'd better save up for that 10,000 point gift you want.
fill out a 360 Yahoo account.  You can then download 4 pictures to use.. Just be careful the pictures you download, or you will be criticized forever...there's no pleasing some people....lolThats right...4 pictures in yahoo 360...some, as you can see use real silly cartoons that indicate the person has no panties.....aint it fun.lol
ask your minor.  if he/she is unwilling to tell you, and you feel that he/she is in any kind of real danger, go to the webmaster.  tell them who you are and why you need to know.it's none of your business to look at it.  Everyone deserves privacy.Unless you believe your child is in danger, why would you want to snoop in his/her email?  That could cause very bad relations between the two of you.Buy this software and install it on your computer.. . http://www.e-spy-software.com/
I'm guessing the you're trying to clear out the searches from the Address bar?? You started out OK by clicking Internet Options on the Tools menu. On the Internet Options dialog box, click the Clear History button. It is not something that can be highlighted.Are you on a Mac?. . If you are using SAFARI on a MAC, go to the Safari menu (top right of the screen by the apple icon), click on RESET SAFARI and click RESET. This will delete all your history and autofill for all web sites.honestly, if your using Internet explorer (i am assuming) you should switch. Firefox has been proven to have less security breaches and is better with customization. if your tired of having to deal with IE's crap, switch to Firefox, it makes the world easier and it automatically moves everything from IE such as favorites and bookmarks to Firefox. just try...
All you have to do is add some more photos to you flickr account.  Then in a couple days they will change automatically.  Maybe only one day, it just doesn't happen ASAP.  That happens anytime you add photosTry your My Page > Share Photos > Can be seen by: . and set your Flickr to private > Save. . You can set photos on Flickr to private too by the way only ones set to public on Flickr and Y photos show on 360 what ever your 360 settings arego to photos preferences on 360 and uncheck the box to import your flickr photos.
As far as I know there are 2 reasons on why Yahoo! Answers removes some questions... . The frist one is, if they find that the question is offensive, has some sexual content and are discriminating.. . The other reason is when you you don;t have a best answer to yuor question, it is automatically removed as thus it will be of no use....They removed a totally legit innocent question of mine. I am still baffled. The question was whether you like answering better or asking better, on Yahoo Answers. Is this an offensive question? What rule does this violate. Beats me! :) I think, someone is NOT paying careful attention. Is this a PERSON doing it, or the computer I wonder.because they don't like it! and maybe some are bad...Maybe, Yahoo felt it didn't pertain to the catagory you posted it in. Its not their job to put into a relevant catagory, it's yours.. . Yahoo Answers is here to, Primarily, help people. It also provides entertainment value. If your question doesn't fit the catagory it shouldn't be there. There are enough catagories for you to find one for your question. If you can't find one, then, maybe, you should think twice about posting it.Because they are not getting answered or commentted on... This is Yahoo ANSWERS, you knowMany innocuous questions still violate the Community Guidelines because they're classified as "chatting" type questions.  You can mail them at y_answrs_team@yahoo.com to talk to them for your specific case.sensorshipOffesive
I agree soda will not work on the rust, but I seriously doubt heating it up is safe. The best (and cheapest) way to go is with some common acid, like vinegar or pure lemon juice (not lemonade since it's diluted in water). The acid will react with the rust and decompose it.Use liquid wrench. Soak & let set overnight. If you don't have liquid wrench try WD-40. Not as good but it might do the trick.Wd-40 is a water displacer... liquid wrench ain't much better.... these do NOT work on rust.... nor soda.. try some pb blaster.. if that doesn't work then try heating it up and knocking it off...., some will melt a little wax down between there. Be careful to not burn the lower oil seal on the crank. other then that.... cutting and using a puller may have to be done.I've heard that coca cola removes rust.
Since you're probably reading a translation ... there are bound to be errors or lost meaning. Taking it literally as if God spoke in English is naive.completely inaccurate, contradictory, and hypocritical
They are trying to make it better for the people!! not just you they are trying to make it better for the general populousI was changed once and look how I turned out perhaps I can change again but who knows. I had an ugly streak but it turned into lightning. and about that gaseous odor? perhaps we can come to an abyss and discuss grandification.
BECAUSE IF THE PEOPLE ARE REALLY TRYING TO FIND SOMEONE THEY THINK THAT YAHOO ANSWER'S HAS THE ANSWER. I DON'T THINK THAT THEY ARE TRYING TO HURT ANYONE BY WHAT THEY ARE DOING BUT PEOPLE WILL DO ANYTHING TO GET WHAT THEY WANTBecause people will ignore it anyways.You're assuming these naive people will actually read these warnings.  It's disturbing to see those questions requesting personal info, especially the social security & address question.  It's even worse when someone actually answers it!  I think these people are either very young or just immature.Would defeat the purpose.  Nothing better than learning the hard way.  When people point out their stupidity.  Yahoo could have a choice for irresponsible use of facilities when reporting and if they do it more than once they get a temporary ban.I believe many of the posters to YA are morons, and probably deserve all they get.. . Those that put other people in the poo deserve even more.yup....nice question!...there are already sooooo many idiots these days!dont know, dont care, MORE STALKING FOR ME!Your the only idiot I see out here!!!This means democracy or your question is inapropriate.The same reason Pizza Hut doesn't post an adequate warning for all the idiots out there who like Buffalo Wings.See the little blue report abuse.  They don't know about it until someone points it out.
They send me email notices when one of my answers has been chosen as best. But as for if someone gives it a "thumbs up" that is to the right on the "My Q&A" page. You get one point if someone gives your "best answer" a thumbs up. So you possibly could continue to get points even after your answer is chosen as best.click on the your name at the top ( in blue) go to your answers.. and click on the "best answers" button.. it will show all your best answers.Your Best answers so far,.  just click your name next to the "Hello" and click "best Answers". .

If the person is invisible they are invisible.  You can't see them, cause they don't want you to see them.If his,or her ID is "invisible" than you should see their ID somewhere in your sidebar, right?he is on line but not ready to communicate or not present on his desk at the momentI used to have a little program I made but sometimes check his profile out sometimes if they have their settings wrong it will show him on like in games or another part of yahoo. Other wise I used to just boot them and see if the come back. This one booter I had told me if they were still connected or not....lmfao it was kinda fun sometimes
Because only 7 - 11 have a good thoery as to what the answer is.Because some questions have definitive answers and if you ask a question that I know the answer to and someone already answered it. I won't because that would be redundant. And some questions that require thought and complex answers, well sometimes people are just not in the mood to think, they just come here to get their minds off of complicated things.It might be the type of questions you are asking. Try something new! Also becuse people read your questions and notice that you are a teen and asking some pretty lame questions.because probably not alot of people want to answer them, or few people know the answer.. You take it how you see it.We're the only people who can tolerate answering your questions at the present moment I suppose. There is no such thing as a stupid question, just as long as you don't mind a stupid answer. Be glad that people are answering your questions!probably they just don't feel like itHow many answers do you need, you damn Democrat.I wondered the same thing about mine, but I think sometimes people just don't know how to answer, or aren't interested in the category. There are too many categories for everyone to look at every question!maybe people don't have an answer to your question.thay mate not want to answer to is questionerMost just cruise and not really stop to check it out
When you are in Yahoo! Mail, click on "Options" in the upper righthand corner. Make sure that you are in the "Mail Option" in the lefthand bar.  In the second column, which is labeled Management, click on "Signature" and insert whatever you want, with whatever formatting you want.If you mean signature like you sign a piece of paper, scanning.If you want an animated signature...do a web search. When you find your name, most emails (like yahoo) will let you copy and paste it into your email.. Here is a link to some:go to options.there is a option of "use my signature".click o that option.whenever u write a mail at the end of mail there is a option "use my signature".click it and sigature will be used eachtime whenever u select the option.good bye and have a gr8 timeGo to your Mailbox>Options>Signature, write it, and voila!go to options on your email and then signiture and then you type in what you want as your signiture.
it could be a java problem. try to make sure you have the upgraded java software on the pc-it's a software required mopstly for online gamessounds like your internet security program is stopping it from opening.. . if you have internet security op a popup block try disabling them when opening the file
Depends on the program you're referring to.  In which case, you need to clarify..

I listen to my iPod, play the piano, read books, sleep, or go on to Yahoo! Answers...I sleep or watch channels such as the hist channel, hist int'l, travel chan, discovery chan (animal planet kinda sucks). . they always have something intersting on that I don't know about.Write, read, watch TV, surf the net, answer Yahoo Answer questions, post msgs on my groups, veg...I go on the computer and e mail people bcuz if I have nothing to do i can talk to my friends and c wat theyre up toYAHOO!!!go to the gym or catch up on TiVoGo online and answer questions.I usually hang out on Yahoo Answers, Play video/board games w/family or just watch TV.I party and get wasted.  Ha, it's so fun.  Right now I'm at work on my lunch, so I can't do that :(.
download latest softwarei think the limit is 300 - if you hit it, you'll be prompted to delete someone before you can add someone new.try signing out, and then again sign in, and then try again adding to your contact's list. i'm not aware of any restrictions in the no. of contacts in Yahoo messenger. anyways it must be a temporary problem, it should sort out soon.Actually my I'd have to ask you first how many people you actually have on your list.  30? 50? 100, 500, 1,000????. . There is a point where a limit will be placed on the number of friends you can have on your list.  Could be that you've reached that limit.
Click on the Messenger menu and then on My Profiles. There you can find the link to set up extra profiles and which ones will show up online or not. Whenever you send a message to someone, a drop-down menu will show up asking you which profile you want to use. The option will no longer be there if a conversation has already started, but if you close the window you can start a new one.Id like to know that myself...
Go to your Yahoo Mail account.  Click on the "Options" link in the upper right corner.  Click on the "Vacation Response" link in the Management column.  Finally, click the "Turn Auto-Response Off" button.Exactly HOW to do this is a widely diverse as all the different types of email software out there.  Generally speaking, however, the option to rescind an away message is in the same menu or list that gave you the option to leave the away message.
Australian for sure. In the US they call them brush or wild fires. Here are a couple links.Bushfires normally hae a distinctive smell and colour. They smell very woody and the smoke usually vaires from hazy blue to deep puple at its most worst stage. When its being put out it generally gets white smoke. Bushfires flare with the wind and are often started by firebugs or glass thats been let i the bush which gains anhle from the sun and ignites. They norammy kill a huge population of native animals and can create new fires with blowing embersthe war in IraqThey are bushes that are on fire.
You probably have that function shut off on your yahoo messenger.  You will have to go back in and reconfigure it to save your off line msgs and conversations.Try reinstalling Yahoo Messenger.  It may be that Yahoo upgraded their server, but you didn't upgrade your messenger.I believe once offline messages are closed they are deleted. You may check your options in messenger and see if there is something in there to help you. OR contact yahoo if it's through them.u can't.....or......ask at yahoo....
Because no one can stop them on here, and they think that other people will laugh, now I have heard some funny come backs, MY favorite one was this male asked how he could get his wife to swing(date other couples) and this chick replied tie her to a rope attached to the ceiling, made me laugh, those are the kind of answer those questions deserve, people trying to get their loved ones to do somethign with someone else or asking if they should cheat..  But I think there are questions that deserve natural answers however, people dont like to respond in a way you want to hear, just how others want to hearBecause, by making you feel bad (or thinking they made you feel bad), they feel good. . . Don't worry about what random people say to you. It's not like these people know you.I am probably guilty of this myself at times, but not for serious questions.. . Eg, if someone asks "why are we here" (a question that I answered today) then I think I can try my hand at being witty.. . However, say I was answering a question about parenting, I would put alot of thought into it.. . Basically, it's open slather here as the forums are there for one and all.  You just have to ignore the knockers.well because people think that they know it all and think they can write anything on here you know what I'm saying I'm probally on a pre teen but i know this stuff yyyeaahhh I'm smart like thatBecause some people feel the need to be jerks, and for some reason it makes them feel better. They are negative so they have to try to make the rest of the world negative and down with them.
you would have to beef up the engine to 1000 hp and unless you are starting with a v8 engine. youll never get a rice rocket to do 0-60 in 3 seconds.I Agree - drive it off a cliff.. . Will it really reach that speed in that time, though?  I'm no physicist.you could have it in park and run the gas for a little while and then put it in drive and see what you getpush it off a clifDrive it off a cliff...tie it the back of an airplaneA blower would add get up and go, a turbo charger would have turbo lag and im not sure about centrifical super chargers.Trade it in for a top fuel dragster? No street-legal car can accelerate that fast.Buy a ZX10R motorcycle.. . Or, take EVERYTHING out and off your car that isnt necessary, after doing ever engine mod available. Of course, it would help if I knew what car you had - it may never go 0-60mph in 3 seconds! But, after engine mods (add a turbo or supercharger), weight loss is the best way to go. Take out the carpeting, seats (except yours!), stereo, dash, etc. Also, maybe make some arodynamic changes too.... . Good luck!Strap it a plane and drop it from 13,000 ft.  Watch it go "SMASH"i cant help,i dont think my car can go that fast,i love him tho he is my best friend,his name is frank and he really really likes to drink oilPut in a Corvette Z06 engine.Take it to Overhaulin..Buy a different car, OR you can invest a couple hundred thousand dollars to make yours that quick.Actually, a Bugatti Veyron can go from 0-62 mph in 2.5 seconds...so buy one!Drive it off a cliff.aint gonna happen dude,its been tried by the best of the beststrap it to a jet
Because when they were handing out legs, the earthworms thought they said "segs" and said to themselves "Segs?

well, if you know what types of questions you want to answer, you can do a search for them (do advanced search and choose open question so that you only see ones you can answer). you may still see some inappropriate questions, but not as many, especially if you're specific in your searchesi've discovered that every catergory has some type stupid q. sometimes i just can not help but to give a smart a** answer
I agree with childs puppet,should be -2.. .           Name_________________________(y! name) if you agree.Should GET points for interesting q'si think 2 points more fairi think -5 should be no more then a -2. if we can answer a question and get 2 pts. then asking one should be the same amount.Thats what points are for.. To buy a question and get an answer from someone who might know.I think its very smart for yahoo to intergrate the "Charge per Question post", the first point is that, it help eliminantes spam for the most part, cus i would hate to see 10,000 post saying "Check my webcam" or " View me now baby", some crap like that.. . As long as we're charged, we are given the incentive to answer questions for other yahoo members, and gain points. I really like their motivation upon releasing this type of area for the community.
On here it's a way to check on who has the best score in answering the questions.. Or finding out where you stand, if you have managed to answer any.

Click on "choose as best answer".. . Here's hoping you choose me.....Go to 'My Q&A' page, and select the question you would like to resolve. The option to chose best answer will appear on the right side of the screen. It is important to remember that you have to wait 24 hours after posting before closing the question.You cannot vote for it as best answer if you asked the question.  However you can choose it as best answer.yep...what they said^^Oh boy...click on best answerSign up for another Yahoo account. Otherwise, you can not choose your own answer as the best.I think there is a waiting period ? Then vote. Click on best answer you like.click the vote for this answer(or whatever it says) button. i think u can do it. I don't think u can answer ur own question tho. that would defeat the purpose

I could be wrong but I think Yahoo voice mail is a service that actually talks to lonely people. You sign on and it tells jokes etc. I think you can also talk about the weather. . . Many times, it only replies "Oh, I see. Please tell me more." That gets kind of boring.please pass u r id when i try it i will tell uIf you have a headset, then you and your mates can call each other via your PC - then the voice mail is answer machine!  Its great and doesn't cost anything.  I use it for long distance.

Because you might of misspelled the e-mail address that you were sending to or their email address is not valid anymore.Sometimes that is caused by an incorrect email address.  But it can also be your email server acting up.there was an error - try again or perhaps the email no longer existsbecause you are sending it to a non functioning email addressYou need to tell mailerdaemon to STOP STEALING YOUR MAIL!. . Contact the US Postal Service they can help.  No one should be taking your mail without authorization.ur e-mail address that u are sending to might be incorrect. i had that a couple times and when i fixed my sending address it worked again. i suggest that u try that. otherwise ur e-mail provider (the website) or ur e-mail address is strangeMost times it's not *your* fault but the person you are sending mail to is having a server problem or maybe their mailbox is full.  If you look at some of the details in the message, it should give you a reason (like unknown recipient, for example) why it was sent back to you.  Sometimes if you wait a few hours, you can resend & it will go through because the problem was cleared up on the other end.

You will see a picture of an envelop besides the large Yahoo signature. Click it, you will see an option where it is written, New registration or create mail account. You can proceed according to further instructionby Yahoo.when you get a little bigger I will help you make one OK?
You can't. You would have to send them a message to their personal phone number, or shoot 'em an email....better yet, call'em.Send a mesage back and see what they ment by "501".
Possible that the way the Web Site was built it's surver doesn't accomodate your comuter software type. Do you have outdated computer software? Do you have telephone dial up line?there could be alot of reasons for this.  First and foremost check you Internet safety options in the Internet Options of tools
Use a comma after each email address.Put the email addresses of everyone you want to send the email to in the "To" line. Make sure you separate their names by commas.
This question is mis-categorized.  It should be in Yahoo! Products > Yahoo! Messenger.I'm not sure exactly what you are trying to say...
I find short and succinct is the way to go. Easier to read and understand. Depends on the question though. More detailed questions require more detailed answersThere are several reasons, starting with those who merely cut and paste from another site.  It takes no extra effort to cut 3 pages than it does 3 sentences.. Then there are the people who could not summarize or do not know the topic well enough.  They do not know when to stop.. And then there are the fanatics who believe that everyone is just hanging on every word and they must give 3 years of history behind every answer.. Lastly are the answers which must have a lengthy answer to do them justice.  No cut and paste, no misinformation, no extra BS, no fanatical ramblings – just a moderate to lengthy answer, honest and as much to the point as possible.I think a long answers is good if it shows that the person has really thought about your question. Unfortunately 9 times out of 10 a 'long answer' is simply a cut 'n' paste from Wikipedia.I'm one of the ones you mean, and I will defend myself on this.. . If you get a lot of short answers, there's a good chance you find what you needed to know there, and you don't have to read the long one.  But this question and its answer is also being archived for future reference.  So "category > resolved" questions, neatly arranged (we hope, eventually) by the index position, will result in a large body of useful knowledge.  And some people may want more detail than the original answerer did.  Since it's not always easy to say something in just a few words, I will take my time.  Whether you take your time to read it is of little concern, unless I'm playing just for points.Objective questions can be given objective answers. And objectionable (!) Questions will also receive brief tongue-in-cheek replies.. But others ?. Some answers will certainly not be fun for others to read, but will convey ALL that the Questioner NEEDS to know. . ...If you find these boring, just move on to the next, dear :. 'One person's food can seem another's poison' !True.Sometimes questions do require a long answer. Most times I agree it's over kill. Just like me answering this question.. It doesn't need all this just to get the point across.. The first sentence woulda been good enough.. LOLPeople like me give long answers because they believe that they are truly helping a person in need. I give long answers because the questioner often doesn't understand what they are asking. I explain the answer so that they won't have any follow up questions. Let's look at your case. You do not understand why people leave such long answers. The first person to answer your question said, "True". Which is hardly an answer to your question, he is simply stating his affirmation to your question in an attempt to grab at two points. Did it help your situation? No. My answer, however, goes in depth and explains a person's motives for answering a question in lengthy detail. Your question may not be of much significance, but somewhere, there is somebody who's father is dying of cancer and can't find any help because people are simply saying "true" to their questions. I and many other people like me are devoted to helping them find their answer. Does that answer your question?. . I also get the 10 points for best answer a lot, so HA!you made a point. look at all the short answers!show offs initBecause they all want best answers and they think thats the best way to get them.I try to answer to the point, and as precisely as I can.. . The long answers are, at times, required.. . Some answerers are just trying to impress the questioner; so I feel as though it goes by a case-by-case basis.they feel the longer it is, the more impressive it isI wouldn't change a word in the answers given by andizzle and richard and there's really nothing more to add. I'll have a tough time choosing between the two at vote time so why don't you pick one of those little bitty answers yourself?Yes and NoSometimesi agree ...keep it simple.....am here for a good time not a long timedunno.maybe they wanna get their point across or something?i prefer short
open my photos and than open the album, check the box beside the picture that u want to delete,a nd than click EDIT button there u wills ee a list fo actions , in that u will see DELETE, clcik it, and it will ask for confirmation, clcik DELETE again and it will delete the photo. --------. Yahoo photos web dos,nt use a seperate DELETE button althought they should, adding the DELETE link confuses new photos users, i also had trouble in finding delete,a nd at last i found it under the edit,, . any way,, good luck man/mamif u dunno ... contact their customer services la.... actualli they hav option in yahoo photos one wert... juz select n press del lor ...lol
I love reading the comments that are left by other answerers it makes the question all so more interesting.  So I guess that's why it deserves points.Over half of the comments I've seen just say "Thanks for selecting me as best answer" or something along those lines. There have been cases where people add actual content in the comments section, but it's too rare to be deserving of a point for each time. As mentioned above, it also keeps users who want to get points focused on answering those questions that are currently open.I know!! When I've reached my limit on answering questions and voting for best answer, I want to be able to get more points by commenting.I don't know but maybe yahoo answers thinks that if we get points for leaving comments everybody might just put in comments instead of answering questions.It seems that you get 1 point for comments. If not you do for voting for the best answer.
This is not a bug. You currently have 143 points on Level 1. If you would like to reach Level 2 you need 107 points. As you gain more points the number of points you have will go up, and the number you need will go down.143+107=250.  What's wrong?When you ligged in to yahoo answers go to the end of the page and there will be written "Help us improve Yahoo! Answers. Tell us what you think.". click on "Tell us what you think" Link the feedback page will come and then wite your suggestion.. . Hope it help you.Just spit it out I'm sure someone from big brother is watching.
go to your profile page and edit your contact information. If you have your real name there it shows on your emails.I think you can't do thatDO what webjnke suggested--HOWEVER, make SURE you keep the FAKE information somewhere on a WORD file in your PC, in the event you forget your password--Yahoo will ask you to verify the information on your Account Page.Edit your mail profile.  I believe you can do that in Mail option in yahoo mail.. . Davidjust go into your account and it should be in there where you have to change it.Once you're logged in to your email, click on "my account," you can change the preferences and change your name as you want it to appear.go to my accunt of ur yahoo mail there u ll get one option of sending ur messg as ur desired name there u can giv ur name. the reciever ll recieve ur messg in ur name only
if your talking about your Y answers pro. and account then - the way i understand it is just not log on it at all for 60 days and it will auto. be deleted.I like to know that also
It doesnt work on Y360 which is kinda strange cos both are Yahoo products and you would of thought they would work together.. . I have tried both badges and its no go. No idea when it will be fixed as i have asked numerous Yahoo staff and no reply as of yetGo to "My Q & A" and it gives you a code that you can put into your 360 page. I have one on the website I created.If you go to your "MY Q&A" section it gives you the cut-and-paste code towards the bottom of the page.click on (help)
You can read the instructions from the mail help pages:. . http://help.yahoo.com/mail/pop/pop-28.htmlYou have to purchase the premium yahoo mail service for pop access. Unless you are with SBC Broadband or Rogers which offers free email through Yahoo (with pop access).Without purchasing premium service, I believe you can save your emails from Yahoo to a file and then open the file in Outlook. Not the most convenient way, but it keeps the emails on your hard drive.
Goto help in any yahoo section. naviagte through some silly question and then say that your question was still not solved. It will take you to a feedback form which helps you contact the yahoo team.yahoo.comUmmm;;;I have a number which is billing, however they can send you  over to who ever you need?. .

Log in to yahoo mail. Select options (right hand corner). Select General Preferences under Management.

Looking forward to seeing the Real you.  Cheers,  Earl.
ur under 18 sweety.... or at least that's the information yahoo has...Maybe because you're under 18.Most likely you need to change your settings, yahoo automatically puts a protection on your page you need to tell them you are over 18....an easy way is to do a search for something explicit, and then it will tell you that you have to change your settings, and will walk you through it.. Good Luck!!!!. xxSWT_GURLxx
You can start by learning to spell.  Stay in school.I assume you mean the computer security system, if so read below. If you mean the metal/x-ray detector then you could wait for the gaurd to be distracted and go around the detector. I don't advise you do that unless you wanna be shot.. . First learn how to spell. Anyway you need to connect through a proxy server. Most schools have put Internet Explorer into a locked down mode. So you'll need to load Firefox, or another less popular browser onto a USB stick. Run Firefox (or other browser) from the USB stick. Then go to tools-->options-->general-->connecion settings--> and then enter in the information on how to connect thru a proxy server.. . Where to get the various stuff from. Do a Yahoo! search for "proxy server". Buy a 64MB or bigger USB stick from BestBuy, OfficeDepot or other shop selling electronics.. Download Firefox and install it to your USB stick. Firefox can be gotten from mozilla.comput down the killing blades little girl and GO TO SCHOOL!!!!ok, I guess those other people shouldn't have been such jerks answering your question. why do you want to get past the system? if you want to hurt somebody, you need to think again, because if you do, and you go to prison, your gonna get hurt a whole lot yourself. second, there are things out there i the world that can fix the way feel about life. you need to go to a counselor, or a doctor. please, don't do anything to ANYBODY it could be my kid out there. How would you feel if it was you?Well, judging by your wretched spelling, it is pretty obvious you haven't been there in a while.  I suspect maybe this is why you can't find a loophole.You can get through them easily..you stand in line just like everyone else.  Make sure you have your books and homework with you too!well first you have to be fucking smart enough to spell the question right to ask someone on yahoo "sicurity sistum"????simple... if trying to bring in a knife of some sort make sure it's carbon deposits, not steal, in some cases aluminum works too.you don't! they're in place for a reason, so knuckleheads like you don't hurt anyone's kids.  GROW UP!
the picture may not have come through properly. Ask the senders very nicely if they can send it again. if problems consist speak to a mechanicThe X means your browser doesn't have the plug-in to display the picture.

A pike can be a type of fish (i.e. Esox lucius), or a very long spear-type weapon (up to 18' long), or even a stretch of roadway (i.e. New Jersey turnpike).. . In what context are you refering to?i know its a jump in cheerleading! heheA pike can be a spear, a fish, a turnpike, a member of Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity, and more.Why?Well, if you're thinking something like the Mass Pike...it's massachusetts turnpike.  it's also the tip of a spear. with which you can proceed to "pike" someone, and cause serious injury.  it's the summit of a mountain or hill.  You can make it mean anything you want as long as you speak with confidence.Large freshwater fish - what else?

Some people can't decide, or don't see an answer that really addresses their question.. . What I hate is when they pick the worst question in order to reply to it.Ok, feeling like an idiot here, I don't know how to resolve mine!! They just keep going back into voting because of a tiebreaker and I want to just pick the best answer and move on but I don't know how to do it!!I think some people either don't care about the points or don't realize you get points for resolving answers ( I didn't know it myself when I first came her)ARRRGHHH! It's aggravating, isn't it? I think maybe some people don't know how or maybe don't know they're supposed to. And maybe some are just too lazy.  :-)people don't know what they are doing half the time.not all people knows everything...
Depends on how juicy the question is. If it ain't interesting I am not answering. Ok, Maybe if its an easy question. lolfalling behind new Q. category search still underusedI DON'T KNOW, but that is a good question.because people want to know what people need help with now not somthing from 2days agoThey get lost in the bottom...and people only tend to answer the newest ones on top.
1st don't give ur password to any body. 2nd u can personalized ur yahoo homepage easily, u r professional don't forget.no one else can see it, only you can...u could change it aroundby signing in yahoo.com and going to MY YAHOOgo to my yahoowell on your my yahoo page there are three options located below the search page:  add content (add comics, movie showtimes, etc), change layout (two-column, three-column, etc.), and change colors (pre-made themes or create your own).

next time- access you acces "your" account- write it down.That would be a useful feature. I think you ought to suggest it to Yahoo!, because you can't do it now.
No, listen to the *other* voice!  . . You know it's there--it's the one saying SLEEP... SLEep..  Sleep... sleep... sl.... sl.... s.... s.... s.... ssssssszzzzzzzzz.......Listen to some Disturbed. Get your mind off things.Take your meds and go to bed....
If I'm not mistaken, the higher the levels the more you can do on here, such as chose best answers to your question, vote best answers, etc. If you click on your level number, it should tell you more. :)No, you can also ask and answer more questions in one day. Click on your points at the top of your page to get a full explaination.The higher the level the more questions you can ask, answer, you can rate more answers and vote for more best answers every day.
Click on chat icon when you sign in to yahoo messenger with you id and password. Then click on the chat icon, chat room lists appear. Choose a chat room - the various rooms there will appear, click on the "+" sign, a drop down of various rooms comes up. Click or couble click and click on "Go to Room", wait till you enter chat.Your spelling isn't that good, so I wouldn't go into chat rooms if I were you.  Plus the chat rooms are just full of bots anyways.I too want the same answer!go to yahoo.com and open the chat room.
If you deleted it and emptied the trash (or Yahoo! emptied it, I heard they sometimes do) it will never come back. If it was important, I hope that didn't happen.if it was deleted from the inbox then go to the trash and retrieve it, if it was from the bulk folder its gone. . good luck
there isn't really a normal count when trying to concieve. during the "act", there can be anywhere between 7 and 30 million trying to fertilize the egg.400 million / cu cc.. . at 2-3 cu cc. / ejection.. . A sperm count 200 million!!!/cu cc. would be LOW. the reason being sperms need to support each other until one 'em makes it.A normal sperm count is between 20 million and 150 million sperm per millilitre. A sperm count below 20 million sperm per millilitre is low and may indicate a fertility problem. Men with low counts can still father children but their chances are lower.mouthful
When you go to the Yahoo! Avatars homepage, there is a link called "Preferences" in the upper right corner.

(sex, age) on most sites for security reasonsI think you're allow to change your profile. Just explore a little and you'll get the hang of it.You can change the age on your yahoo profile just play around with it.Just wait a few years, then you will be 18 :)

cool place to blog (express your self) and to post pictures meet others that vist your page post links to cool sites list movies u like, books you've read and enjoy. Even has a place to tell about you and what your about. Can even design your own page and change it...ITS ALL ABOUT EXPRESSING YOUR SELFYep go check it out.  Yahoo Myspace/flckr/blogits Yahoo!'s version of myspace.  a way to keep intouch with friends, and meet new people.its something like myspace. but more like a profile i guessthe hell if i knowaround the world , uer personal; http.---.comit's called your own space to where you can share your life with your friends, & family, members. you can also post blogs, reveiws, your interests, add photos, feeds, & last but not least a complete profile.
level 5,6 and 7 there is no limit. keeps people from spamming.The limit encourages users to use their limited answers to provide useful info rather than useless. It also gives users an incentive to vote and rate questions to get those extra points needed to go up to the next level.so that we won't live here, lol.  we actually have to go do something else...
I guess I don't understand your question. Are you wanting to know how to see if a certain ID/person is online? Or are you wanting to know if there is a way to know if the ID that you are trying to set up an account with is already in use by someone else online? Please be more specific.Here is a program I use all the time. It tells you if someone is online (even if they are in stealth mode) and also tells you if thier webcam is running.. . http://www.irocs-kingdom.com/YAHOO_TOOLS/SpyNick.zipI use the program Buddy Spy.  It will tell you if they are online (even in Stealth mode), whether or not they have their webcam on and what room they may be in.  It works really well.
It's the people.  Just because someone asks a stupid question doesn't mean they need mean or rude answers.  Maybe they're just trying to have fun or maybe what seems stupid to others is a genuine question for the person who asked it.YupyoghurtThis place is fun, they actually don't know the changes they have made in my life, I spend most of my time alone at home, after my work, and I have learned a lot in just 2 months, things I never heard of, opinion of open minded people, respectful fellows.. In the other hand , this place has a majority of hatred inticers, enemies of everyone, some are really sick and they post nasty and inappropriate question.. I just came across a person called something Virginia26 and i was extremely shocked about the fact that a person thinks it is fun to post nasty and rude questions like that.. so here you go, you got your share of my blabbing ...sensible questions  or honest ones (irrespective of the spelling),i answer to the best of my ability.And sometimes will spend a long time to answer,trying to think of how i can benefit the questioner in the best way.. . biased , stupid , or crude questions ,i answer like wise or not at all.. . and if the question is insulting and it irritates me ,i answer with contempt or venom,or sarcasm.. . so call me rude(but only at times )but i dont see why we have to put up with people who lower the standards while other people are doing their best and spending their time on trying to make a difference.. . and what irritates me is ,if to a question a lot of people give a detailed and reseached answer that obviously has taken some time to compose and the best answer goes to the persons who says simply,---yes  . (and agree with the questioner). they didnt want an answer they only wanted confirmation of whatever .yupSome people just don't understand what a valuble resource the internet is. They spoil if for everyone the way they fool around on it. There is a place online for messing about, and a place for sensible discussion.hey im with yea. people can be... well you knowIt's amazing how rude people can be.I agree. I just want see how people react or think to other's question where people can reveal their true, real-life personalities. Also, I just want to know if there are more bad people or good people online in this world in response to the very sensible, common-sense question.I agree.anonymous forums attract idiots.  myself I have a hard time, sometimes, differentiating serious questions from ones posed by juveniles being silly.I guess so. This whole points and ranking thing is making everyone crazy. It's like Neopets for crackheads. heheDoes that mean I shouldn't be answering this question?
From the motor vehicle department.That's legal to do because if u need the address due to some one running into you.  Or maybe you're going through a divorce and your wife move out to a different address.  You can get the address so you can have papers served on her.  Even if she just moved out without saying anything.. LOL ChuckYou would have to know someone who works for law enforcement who would be willing to run the plate for you.  Or know somebody who knows somebody in law enforcement.go to the rta pay 4 it or black market
   New questions are added to the list in chronological order, that means a new question goes to the top of the list. While you are looking at all the questions on a page 10 more questions might be asked, these would go in front of the list you are looking at pushing them farther back. Once you go to change pages that change in position shows up.Hit refresh on your screenBecause of the questions posted every single second, the list grows so fast that when you change to page page one has got so big it has been almost filled with new questions
I have the same problem.  There is a question that is up for voting, however it shows all of the answers as 0%, and will not let me vote.Maybe you are getting old and dont remember lmao, but dang what the heck is SwishaHouse talking about?? Think someone else is just looking for points and attention dont you?
microfiche are sumthing u can only physically use in a libry or sumthing that holds the records like a libry.. . u can use the internet to research ur family tree but it depends what ur actually lookin for cos there are thousands of websites.  i work in a genealogy centre in a libry in britain so if u want help for british records then i can help-click on my profile to contact me.  . . this help goes for any1A microfiche is a manual viewer where you put a slide (with pages greatly reduced on it) into a viewer and see the result on a big screen (the page is magnified greatly).. . On the net you will not use a microfiche itself but rather see pages that have been scanned.. . If you want to actually use a microfiche you need to go to the records hall in person.
I'm sorry, usually I post serious answers, but I gotta say,. . That is one freaky dog you have on your avatar.. .

Its actually good, u should try getting broadband, it wont work good in dial upYahoo voice - both in Call and in Voice Chat - works fine for me (and I'm usually on only dialup speed!) and for most of my friends.. . If you have problems with it, perhaps give some details of your problem, your system, etc - then someone here can probably help you, if you like.  ?
People fart because at times gas that is swallowed or let off by the foods and acids being digested in your  stomach builds up.  After time it will find the easiest way of escape.  If it just happens to be the anal passage then that is just the way it goes.  Just a natural part of life.. :-)I eat beans a lotcuz theres gas inside u and u need to get it out otherwise the toxins will still be there and it kills you
I think it's because different people may have different answers. In that way you can gather more information in a shorter period of time. Plus, it's also fun because everyone can discover new things from each other...cuz this is more interesting?We all like to think were the center of the universe and that our questions are unique.  If you feel the question is stupid or redundant why do bother answering it?  OH yeah you must feel the need to be superior to everyone else, so get off your high horse.. . As in response to me being cold and unfeeling your probably right.  I still think your question is a statement at how you think you are smarter than others because if you took a couple of seconds to think about it you could figure out the answer.  So if you really want me to answer you legitimate question the answers are that:. 1. They don't know about that feature.. 2. They don't care about that feature.. 3. The answer provided by search is incomplete or not enough information.. 4. Some people are to young for this service and therefore bring a level of immaturity.. . So there are a few possible answers to your legitimate question about why.  Really there could be many others reasons.  If any of my questions are redundant it is because I don't care about the search feature and the fun of this service is see what possible creative answers people can come up with.  If I hurt your feelings or you were insulted by my comments maybe there is a little truth in what I said and you should reflect on that and make the changes necessary to correct that.  Otherwise if I'm way off base then I'm sorry and in the future will avoid responding to your questions.cuz they are too lazythey are lazy or they just want to ask a question because they need attention...who knows.this is fun the search box sounds like it is for dull and boring people who want to cut and pasteThat can't come up with any original questions on there own that can't be answered by typing into a search engine.
Just click on the person who is shown as offline and type a message, just like sending online messages. He/She can see when he/she logs in.You do the same as you would to send an IM.  When you're done and you click send, it will tell you that your friend is offline, but will recieve the IM as soon as they sign on.
When the Yahoo! Widget Engine (YWE) starts, it launches the Widgets that were running when the YWE was stopped. So, if the Weather Widget wasn't running when you stopped the YWE (perhaps you right-clicked on the Weather Widget and chose Close Widget?), then that explains why it does not appear when you start the YWEPossible explanation is you have closed weather widget.. All widget can be closed.. Go to My Documents/My widget and double click on weather widget.well i can asnwer this question, its easy. . 1. go to my document and click my widget and find the program that says "Weather"
That is where you flag it for yourself.. I would say that you clicked in the wrong place and did not remember it.. To unflag it just click on the flag.You flag emails in your inbox, to make them more important, and in order to find them easier when searching for them
I have thought about that myself and I believe that a portion of the "meanies" are insecure people who haven't yet learned to enjoy their own skin.  Therefore they feel the need to be the most twisted, or the most mean, harrasing, rude, sexual etc. runs high, and the internet is convienient because the meanies of this world can easily carry on without retribution.  But these are the same people who usually end up alone.simple... it's because they are mean.Cowards pick on people with their keyboards.Because that is how most people are nowThey probably have too much time on their hands and have nothing better to do. Plus, they might think they are just being cute and funny.i don't think people mean to be rude they just say what they think for the most i think the answers are good maybe i haven't seen the ones you are talking about ,if i have said anything to hurt your feelings or anyone Else's I'm sorryattentionThey have too much time on their hands and nothing better to do and alot of them just do it to make other people mad. That's just how some people are. Just ignore them.They do it because they have too much time on their hands, and they can.probably because they have nothing better to do than to initiate conflict. Just ignore those people - theres no way to change them.because the don't have a life and they "TRY" to make people feel like there stupid,like they have all the answers in the world. which really don't make since to me.Because people are becoming very selfish in todays society.  Everything is me, me, me, . . . .

Its just a competition among other people, so they can get to be in the leader board. also the points gives you more privileges to ask more questions.Nothing...absolutely nothing...Kinda puts things in perspective doesn't it?To raise your self esteem.

nope.......sucks hu? Gotta have the yahoo 360 or myspace to be able to do it...I think yahoo should change that! I wont get myspace or the yahoo 360I've been wondering that same thing. When you find out can you let me know?To my knowledge you must use a 360 account.  On your Answers profile page you only have 3 options for a pic.  1) no pic, 2) a 360 pic, 3) a Yahoo avatar.. . So, using a 360 picture is a 3 step process. . 1) you'll need to create your Yahoo! 360 account.  http://360.yahoo.com. . 2) you'll need to upload a couple of pictures to your 360 page.. On your 360 page, select "My Page" from the top. Select "Edit Personal Photos" on the left hand side. Browse to your saved photo(s) (assuming you have one or more ready) to upload it.. Select the "Set as Primary" button next to the photo want displayed on other sites (like Answers) and select "Save". . 3) you'll need to display your 360 picture on Answers. Go to your "My Q&A" page, select "Edit My Info". In the "Picture" section, select "Use my Yahoo! 360 Picture" . This link will get you to that page, http://answers.yahoo.com/my/my_edit. . That should do it.Go http:/avatars.yahoo.com! (exclamation mark must be there, I think)

You create a Yahoo! 360? profile first.. You go to your "My Q&A" then click "Edit My Profile" then choose "Get Yahoo! 360? Profile"- - - then you take it from there.i dunno.. such a shame, what a cute avatar!what you do is rename and then close out and look on the messenger and its thereyou need to click on the little thing that shows a blank person its next to the other iconYou should go into settings in Y!Messenger, then look for Display Images...make sure that is enabled. You should be able to choose which picture you want, including your avatar.you click on the i made boz and a list comes up with crete your own avator and then make your avator and then click done and it should pop upok, um click on any friend that's on your list, on the bottom right it says image, click it, and click on share my avator and then click ok, i hope you got it nowYou create an avatar, which you already did and you select display image on Yahoo Messenger.
You made a statement and asked for a question.  That's the opposite of the rules.  You have to ask a question or answer a question.....)(Putting a question mark at the end would not have made it a question. You violated the guidelines by not asking a question. Yahoo! is not censoring you. It owns this site and has every right to remove anything it wants. And before someone cries "free speech," it is not a matter of free speech. Anyone is free to create their own website or blog and write what they want.I'll let you know a little secret. This is about the most uncensored site I have been on.Because you are supposed to ASK a question and people are supposed to respond with answers.  Yours was in reverse.. . Question mark or not, if it's not a question, then YA can remove it.  Pure and simple, buddy :)I can only guess that it is for the reason of wanting to keep it for people who seriously want to contribute in a positive manner, rather than a destructive one.
yahoo messenger will show u idle if dont use ur computer for some time which may be set by or by default. By default it is 15 minutes.it condition that the yahoo is not sign out properly and the other methord when there person is not use computer . k . bye. take caremost likely they have stepped away from the computerIt's a top secret way Yahoo has to identify lazy people on their system. If you get 12 Idles in a month they cut you off. Better get busy.When someone's Yahoo Messenger is on, but they are out of their computer area, i.e. meeting customers, phone call, on the shower, etc.IT MEANS WHEN SOMEONE IS AWAY FROM THEIR COMPUTER FOR A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF TIME. LIKE THEY ARE NOT THERE. WHEN THEY RETURN THE IDLE WILL GO OFF, KINDA THE SAME WITH A CAR, IT IDLES WHEN ITS NOT MOVING.

double check that you ignored them. maybe first time you did it, you might have forgot to click apply or ok, and just closed it.Maybe the ignore is no longer click to "ignore". Re-check you settings and you may not have the problem any more. If you wish to avoid the person from seeing you online, click "permanently offline" on the stealth settings.When you see an a message from this person, close your eyes, put your hands over your ears and sing "I can't hear you I can't hear you!" in a stupidly childish and loud voice.check if u really have him/her on your list and if u do i don't know but if u haveen put him/her on it now!

It's 9 Karrat gold..... standard gold is 18K to 24K.... . . 9 is lesser number and I don't think it's worth any purchasing...The higher the count like 18ct 22ct 24ct the more gold you have, I think 9ct is standard.hummm.... . gold? Gold trinkets have long been valued by people of the world. As a rare metal, gold is one of the most desired substances around and products made from gold can make great gifts and great investments... gold forms have different significance that influence the variety of gold molded shapes created, but most agree that obtaining gold is a sign of wealth and affluence.. . The value of gold is determined by its purity as well as the color in relationship to the overall market prices for the substance. While most gold is yellow, there are also several shades that occur naturally or as alloys when mixed with other precious metals. Gold purity is measured in carats, 24 carats being the highest and most pure. . . Means.. the lower the carat. the lower its gold percentage...Pure gold is 24K. 9k gold is expressed as 9/24 or approx less that 33% pure gold. The rest of the metal may be made up of silver, copper, nickel or combinations of these.

If you go into eBay you will find a large amount of sellers with large inventories of pageant dresses as well as custom dresses available.  Advance your eBay search criteria to "Nearest to You" and it will bring up an assortment of retailers close to your area.  I do hope this helps as I have found the prices to be amazing and the selections are better than almost any bridal salon or boutique.try a wedding gown store...Where are you looking? Texas is a huge "pageant" state, so to speak--so they definately exist (stores selling pageant dresses,that is). You could find one online, I'm sure--probably a greater selection than whatever "physical" stores are in your area. Have it delivered and then tailored to fit.obviously not entering the correct search words...

it can also mean in terms of intelligence or cognition i.e. if they are smart, dumb, or mentally challenged etcIt usually refers to the physical position of someone or something.

I am afraid that I am technically challenged but I have a picture in my box (avatar) because I use Yahoo IM and there I clicked on "Messenger" at the top left bar and then clicked on "My Display Image" and then clicked on "Customize".

The main reason is , babies are fed with milk from "Happy" Cows". Other reasons are the parents dress the boys in pink and the girls in blue.. Yet another reason , they just became gay to piss you off.I think because of, girls just don't like him, he can't find a good girl, he gets dumped by girls too much, or he just finds guys attractivei dont know why you askWhy do some people become gay? that is a perplexing question only because so many of us have the one best answer.  In all honesty, no one really knows.  Childhood exposure, abuse, experimentation and discovery plays a very significant role in how we form our sexual identity and opinions as adults.. . Perhaps a same sex experiment/exposure may have triggered curiosity which is later explored.  Perhaps an early childhood abuse occured that later shaped and formed identity issues, sexual worth issues or just destroyed the individuals true liberty to express themselves sexually.. . Some say that it is a genetic code for some. Perhaps one is born that way and discovers it as their true sexual preference and not by environmental exposure but rather through true love for someone of the same sex.. . Which ever the case... be true to your self not influenced by friends, piers or music videos !I'm not sure it is so much that people "become" gay so much as it is that they just come to the realization that they are gay. Or it could be that they knew they were gay but were afraid to admit it because of the stigma placed on gay individuals. There's also that thing that they thought they were gay but were never really sure and now they are. Gay isn't something that people choose ~ you either are or you aren't or you're bi ~ it isn't something you "become". It is simply the way a person is and the whole "becoming" gay is just really admitting it to oneself and others.
You need to create a new account.  And I recommend you delete everything from your current account since you just publically listed your personal info.Please delete this question immediately. The option to do so is just to the right of your question on this question page. Anything you write on here is public information.. . Please also change your password immediately:. http://help.yahoo.com/help/us/mail/access/access-07.html. . (There is no way to change your Yahoo! ID other than creating a completely new account. If you would like to create new profiles you can use while chatting, click on the Messenger menu and then on My Profiles. That's where you can create new nicknames to use.)
ohhh I never feed trolls! I just drop kick them back under the  bridge!... but perhaps  some people just want their 2 points...lolWell?  It makes some people feel better to give them a "ration" for wasting space on Yahoo Answers.. So, for some it is an outlet, but what they don't realize is that they are feeding the "fish".You must be talking about male26 and his goons and if not then what is your question? Add details.trolls,, i havnt seen any,,huh, show me.I know they'll never learn from anything I have to say or rate my answer as the best answer, but I sometimes think that someone more rational (or impressionable) might open their questions and read my answer. I do it for those people, not the trolls.

I receive spam on my email and I want to stop them before they get on email.I use the spam block but other spams go on with. the samme souce markings,names of email addresses. How do I stop them from comming on my email?Click on the spam button. That should block that address.Since u know this unwanted user delete the mail straightaway.
Well, if you are using cuss words or words of that nature and the person you are emailing is behind a fire wall of some type like at work then that could be why your email gets returned as SPAM.when it happens to me it drives me crazy too. yahoo very rarely treats actual e-mails a spam because its spam filters are sophisticated. Unfortunately it's not so good with other mail providers. so you either need to create "white list" or set up a filter or something depending on the e-mail providerAdjust the spam filter in your email program.
easy go to your account then deltego to control panel and click on aadd or remove progams and scroll down until you find it then click on it and click on uninstall or does it say remove? i don't know but it has to say one of thoseEasy. at the bottom of the page there is a subscribe and unsubscribe sentence where you can click either one and that'll take care of the problem.
You are in 3rd Grade!!! Why are you asking questions like this?!If you have to ask, you're too young to know. It has something to do with adult content. You'll learn about that when you're older.****************** happy? :)it means you should choose you words more carefully.dose = A specified quantity of a therapeutic agent, such as a drug or medicine, prescribed to be taken at one time or at stated intervals.It's coverin up a bad word. (And it's spelled "does" sister!)Sometimes when you say a cussword.Words that are considered vulgar by yahoo answers. They block the word with asterisks.that's alot of stars! 2 pointsIt is usually used to censor out profanity.I guess it could mean anything.  Anything with 14 letters in it, that is.it's like when you type a word that is considered immoral; let's say, i wanna write m*asturbate, but it appears like: masturbateYour question is incomplete.
It seems to depend on the number of people who can aswer that particular question.. . 10 or more answers might be great but maybe you might get your answer with 2 responses.. . Like your question you are going to get lots of answers.it all depends on how well detailed the question is presented..if its unreadable or hard to comprehend then of course less would answer..some rare questions would get 50 to 100!Well some questions a lot of people ARE INTRESTED IN AN SOME QUESTIONS NOT LIKE THE QUESTIONS I ASK USALLU ONLY GET LIKE 5 TO 8 ITS FREAKY I MEAN LIKE ALAWAYS NEVER LIKE 10 OR 1 OR 20 IS THAT WHAT HAPPENS TO U TOO BECUASE IF SO NOT ONLY ONEPeople ask dumb questions that aren't worth answering.
Would anyone want to read it?  There is enough ranting on here as it is, especially in politics and religion.Because a rant is not a question. This service is about asking and answering questions, not ranting.try craigslist that has some choice rantsyahoo has not done one yetThere would be so much traffic in it, that the site would shut down.Probably because we're supposed to share knowledge, not diss one another. I don't know about ranting, but I do think we should have a "Complaints" section.I don't know why but I think it's a fine idea!Oh, there is.  It is called the Religion & Spirituality section.  They rant a lot in Politics, too.Because Yahoo hasn't created one yet.
you send an apology for your violations confirming that you won't violate the community guidelines and wait. the email address is in your account suspense notification email and on the page you see when u try to access any of the Y!A services.My other ID was suspended and i send them e-mail(Yahoo Answer Team) and they still didn't get the e-mail back.http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=ArIxtUPR7G8ropEMWgCkAZzsy6IX?qid=1006040205328The best way to have a suspension lifted from your account is to email the Yahoo!

I use Yahoo without AOL.  Have had no problems with any of it. I got mine through SBC AND Yahoo is my internet provider.Download IE 6.0, Netscape or Firefox and use one of them as your browser.. . You can set Yahoo up as your home page so it comes up when you open your browser.you can still sign on to yahoo, just click on you big blue E on your desktop then put this in the address bar www.yahoo.com click go, you can make yahoo your home page, i have aol also but still read my yahoo mail from internet exployerYou still need an Internet Provider.  It doesn't have to be AOL, but you need a company that will connect your computer to the Internet using either a telephone or cable connection.do you have a Internet icon other than AOL, because then just type in your fave search engine for yahoo.com yahoo answers home etc. and then you're on yahooyou go to my yahoo; then go to more yahoo; then choose messenger; then download; and it doesn't matter if you have AOL, you can still have yahoo!

When it opens click on "sign out", then uncheck the "remember my id and password" option and log in again.. Next time you try to sign in, itll ask for ur password.. . It is better to set it up to require your password everytime you want to log in.. This will keep other people, who might have access to your computer, away from your private stuff.. And the reason why i dont like automatical sign in,  is that, after a while of loging in automatically, I tend to forget my password.When it goes to sign on, hit cancel (of if you're on, go to sign off).  then the password screen will pop up.  under the password, there is an option for automatic sign on.  uncheck it.  :)just when it opens hit canclejus hit cancle it is so simpleall u have to do is press cancel that has happened to me before where it just signs in automatically and everybody that logs one to your computer and presses it they can enter it. at  the bottom it should say remember my password if it is checked off then click it and it wont show anymore...i hope this helps
just double click the mail you want to open.

The only way I know how is to choose their answer as the best.  I wished I could give 2 best answers to people, but unfortunately you can only choose 1.You can give me 10 points hehehehehe  :)whenever you ask a question, you chose the best answer out of all the answers, and thats how you give someone 10 points.
not everyones native tongue is english. and for the ones that it is the answer is lazinessI guess it must be difficult for you to cope with so many illiterates... I'm lucky because I see most questions asked as clear and sens able. I guess I talk the talk.Oh, surely not most questions.  Too many, I will grant you.  But then, sometimes the question makes sense to a limited audience.  Steve always used to say if I can't understand something, it's probably the name of a rock band.  Since people no longer seem to care about capitalization, I think that assessment is even more true here than it was on tee shirts, which is the context in which he originally said it.either they are illiterate, lazy, or using text-talkBecause most of the people asking these questions did not go to school.Alot of the people who post here are young and it does make a person wonder about the school systems...scary indeed lolEither English is not their native tongue, or they are lazy, or they are stupid, or they are dyslexic. But I don't think that many are dyslexic!You would be surprised at the percentage of the population that is functionally illiterate.Yes, it is! Do you know how much effort it would take to pay attention in English class in school almost every day? That's just crazy! And what about clicking on that "Check Spelling" button? I'd have to move my mouse about five inches on the screen. Do you really think that people have that kind of time?!i know but but at first yourself answer to understanding me you know.........
maybe people do not know the answers? Aske me, i'll tell you ;)because we don't know what the heck you want to knowSometimes people dont answer questions if it doesnt interest them or if they dont go to your topic of question or if they just simply dont know the answer to your question.  Just keep trying.  You'll soon get answers to your questions.  How about you tell us one of the questions you asked and we'll tell you if we plainly didnt see it or if its a rubbish question.just askmaybe your questions are not intrestingBecause you have not typed in a question. So what is the question that you want an answer to? Oh, by the way, Thanks for the two points.Sometimes questions are asked in a way that people don't understand what you want to know. . . Sometimes questions are too silly or just rhetorical quesions. . . Sometimes people just want your opinion and this is not a chat room.what about asking a real qu?.... or maybe not.. that's no fun!I don't knowI hope you are happy now. You have received a number of answers.which questions every question you have asked has been answered if you want a lot of people to answer your question it will have to be a better one than where can i download.........whatever ......for freeWell that depends, maybe we dont know the answer, or that we just did not see you question.i dont knowwhat is your question ?????????????thanks for the 2 points.

They don't. Many of them have never had intercourse with a woman and wouldn't want to.Switch what?  You mean back and forth like bi?  Or start of straight then switch to gay?cos there gay and bent
The prostate is sending a signal to the penis that it is full of urine.  So the penis reaction is to hold, becoming erect.i don't know.......but kind of fun though eh?Most because they have to use the restroom, its not because they are excited.  If it was, then they were excited without you..or because of their dreams.

People dont want to answer those questions cuz this is a place for people to answer dumba** questions like my bf is cheating on me and stuff like that... But I`m interested in that stuff I just never saw ur questions...Why don't you ask me one.Oh my God you're freaking me out!!!! OK what question do you want me to answer? I'm sorry if you feel like I'm neglecting you, it's not intentional I promise. Maybe I just don't know the answer.. Can you please tell me why you've picked me out? There's a link to my Q&A at the top of the page!. Wow how did you do that? It goes to everyone's, whoever they are!! Oh boy do I feel dumb!!! But seriously...how did you get that link?. . Ok I've answered one, but they seem a bit "deep" to me, so I can't answer any more cos I dunno what to put. Sorry, at least I looked and had a go.Why should I open that link?I can't see any question,. I can only see my profilecan't see your questions your on wrong address for e mail issues.because I didn't see it, or didn't know the answer or wasn't on when you asked it.. . BTW your link just goes to my profile page so i still don't know what it was :-)You are scaring me dude. I am answering your question now.. Have a nice day.how can u ask us to answer ur questions when u havent even asked 1...ya...If I would have seen your questions I'm sure I would have answered them if I knew the answer.
That's the way some people get their kicks, dissing others.. And some like to be cute. I've  been rude a few times myself, and I regret it.  I once miss-read a question and dissed that person and when I discovered my mistake, I emailed them with an apology, but they never replied.  So, now--unless someone asks a nasty question--if I can't answer decently or reply with good-humored wit, I move on.You're right it's designed to help other people, but also for fun. I give crazy answers sometimes too. It's just fun to do that sometimes.Very good point.  I think that Yahoo needs to do a much better job of filtering answers to help keep the information relevent to the question.Obviously, because they are mean, stupid, fat, ugly, etc.... ;). . Ask a stupid question, expect a stupid answer.. Ask a smart question, expect a stupid answer.. Ask any question, expect the stupid to answer.. ^_^. . But seriously, when you say people "make fun of," you suggest that *someone's* having fun.  One may gain at another's expense.  A positive intent exists, even if only one-sided, even if dysfunctional and potentially destructive to some others.. . (Try Google Answers, for more professionalism.)You are supposed to report people like that. They are just insecure. Or the people who are asking are truly stupid.well there is always going to be losers who have to ruin it for others. I admit that i insult others but they ask tha dubest questions hahaha. just ignore them i do. OR you can report abuse!im not generally mean to people but some pople totally exploit the system and ask utterly ridiculous and perverted questions- not to mention those who ask rhetorical questions like chicken-or-egg a 1001 times- these people have nothing better to do than waste other people's time.okay you are right in a sense, if they truly want help and ask but don't you agree some questions just beg for a stupid answer? come on think about it? what's my name? how in the hell would we know that? am i pregnant? how old am i?. do billy love me? why? where? who? when? where is my car keys? where is my dog? why does my dog fart? come on now you know just looking at those questions beg you to be stupid.Because anytime you get a large community of people, in an anonymous setting, where they can fire off responses rapidly, you find out that a large percentage of the population are morons, jerks, or both.. . Community systems, such as this, SlashDot, Digg, or NewsVine have to have very good scoring systems to let the responsible users cancel out the noise.  Other than being able to report, I don't think Yahoo has done that.  (In my opinion, the community should be able to mark certain users / answers down, so they go below a certain threshold.  Then folks can just set their threshold the way they want when viewing the site.)i guess because they don't see this as a serious way for asking help. If it's something about technical or how to stuff or facts, then it's more accurate, but this is not where you ask for advice about how to do some of your personal stuffs.God Bless?. Are you a christian or something?. I'm an athiest so I have to make fun of you now.... Jesus lover. HAHAHAHAHAWell there very rude! and lonely with no friends. so I think they like to pick on people to fill in the gap. Or had a traumtize childhood. And I agree with you!THIS QUESTION WAS SO RETARDED. YOU ALSO SHOULD NOT CARE WHAT OTHER PEOPLE SAY. JUST ANSWER THE QUESTION AS YOU WOULD AND IGNORE HOW OTHER PEOPLE ANSWER. SOME OF THE QUESTIONS ARE SIMPLE AND CAN BE ANSWERED BY GOOGLE. PEOPLE ARE JUST TOO LAZY TO SEARCH ON THEIR OWN. PEOPLE GET MAD AT PEOPLE WHO DO THAT.I agree.  I also think some of the questions are really vulgar and ridiculous.Chill it's not that bad!Because they can!if people reply with cheeky answers they are just having fun,if you think the answers are offensive report them.above all chill out and don't take life too seriously just enjoy it xxxshut up....turn your computer off if you have a problem with it,,,thanks for 2 points,,,xI agree with you my dear. I feel the same way. People are just stupid and they probably are always going to be.because it's the inter-net that is what people do. Honestly, do you think some of these dip-wads would actually say something demeaning to someone in person... Nooooo. because 90% of these people only say here what they wish they could actually say to someone face to face. However this could be one of my fatal flaws to say what I mean and mean what I say here, there and anywhere. Ok. I am done ramblingI think that some of the questions on here are just downright dumb and they deserve the answers they get.. . I don't think people need to go out of the way and be blatanly RUDE.Because people can be mean with no backlash or recourse on this type of site. Just overlook all the idiots and filter their responses. Use the ones that are actually helpful to you.
Thanks for all the great answers everybody! We will discuss possibly adding this as a new sub-category, however, in the mean time you can always post your question in Earth Sciences. Hope this helps!Yahoo! Answers doesn't add a new category until many questions have been asked about that particular topic. However, you could always make a suggestion: http://answers.yahoo.com/my/profile;_ylt=ArA2O361z_dd7NygF9eY_OQezKIX?show=AA10030221. . Examples: The Royalty category and the Gay, Lesbian, Transgendered, and Bisexual category. . These categories weren't here when Yahoo! Answers first launched.oml,kI agree there should be - would be interesting and different.there is, it is in the sience part. i think.
Open your messenger. . Type in your blah blah blah.. Click on your address book.. Right click on the contact you want to delete.. Click on delete.all u have to do is right click on the name u want to delete and a list will show up and just choose delete
Click on that smiley face with the plus sign to add a contact.  Then you need your friends' Yahoo address or email address to send them an invitation.  Then you have to wait for them to accept your invitation.You need to have your friends' email address or Messenger ID to invite them to join you on Messenger.click on contacts on ur yahoo messenger and select add contact. a window will open and will guide u further.
Someone on your list probably signed in while you were logged in. It's to let you know they're online and signed in to the messenger.it is just telling you that the person has signed back into messenger
that's a good point. and i agree.. email yahoo....i know me too! but right now u cant change it. its sad cuz the boys can be fat!lol yahoo stereotypes.

Most girls wear high heels to make thereselves look taller. Then some wear them to make their outfits standout.  Some wear them because of style and fashions.  Alot of girls wear them because guys love to see a girl in high heels they think that is sexy.to make them look taller, thus sexier.I wear high heels because I feel sexy in them and I love the look and the sound as I walk.i love looking at high heels.... but i only wear them when i am doing something professional. they hurt and give me blisters.Most girls wear high heels because it lookes professional.  Woman always wear the heels and because of the popularity when you become a woman you would be able to wear heels.  It looks proper.. . I hate high heels.i wear them to make my legs look nicer , and because they make me feel sexy.In my case, because I'm really short and want to look human-sized.. . Sometimes we like to feel sexy, and a good pair of stilettos can do that. But really, every girl has her own reasons.
If the opposite person is a yahoo user, . u see a glowing YELLOW face next to his/her email address on Yahoo email.. . On Yahoo messenger, the same funda works.. . But, you cannot tell if you are on yahoo and he/she is on hotmail.Lemme know if u need more info.The yellow smile will let you know if they are on Yahoo Messenger. If they aren't on YM, there is no way of knowing, unless they send you an email.On yahoo e-mail and messenger, there is a smiley face next to the username. So if it's glowing yellow, the person is on. If it's grey, ther person is offline.yellow smile next to name is glowing
Sounds like you need to read the TOS and compare it to your activities under your Y! ID.I got an e-mail warning aswell.yeah me too, how many questions and answers don't violate the community guidelines, oh I better watch it before I get kicked out of here
It is because it has to appeal to the lowest common denominator.. . Just like reality television.i think they just want to have the most simpliest question not long detailed ones but it does annoy me also i never answer themWell, when you look through the site and see that most of the questions are idiots wanting to know if they are hot or not or kids wanting to know if they can get some help with their seventh grade math homework, you don't have a big pool to draw from.  Besides, at least the featured questions are grammatically sound with proper spelling and punctuation. And most of the time I like them.  Most of the ones I've seen have actually been kind of philosophical if you're willing to put the work into them.Because all of the other questions are stupid vapid and shallow, or they are staements of opinion disguised as questions.Because it's more marketable to list a simple question that people may often wonder about, like "why are yawns contagious?" rather than showing some of the other questions that get posted on here such as "what should i name my penis?".  It looks like a more credible sight, more like an encyclopedia instead of bored people with nothing better to do making up odd questions.Can you see them putting up, "Help i thknk im pregnenatn, whaht do i do help?". . Anyone at the site can see a bunch of questions anyway, I dunno why they bother.
I noticed it is missing to. I am too lazy to type in the mail URL.  I WANT IT BACK NOWDon't know but I find it not easy and really annoying. . I've already told the "genius" Y! Answers Team.The goal here was to get more information visible on the page for those of us at lower screen resolutions.  Those links were taking up quite a bit of vertical space.  . . If popular demand says that we should bring them back, then we'll definitely try and find another home for them.  Just let us know at the forum, thanks!I personally don't like the fact that they removed them..but i think they were having multiple log in issues or something...who knows?I never even noticed they where there in the first place . I use the Y Toolbar it has links to everything what ever page I am on
May be its in a deep sleep or could be just tiredCan you make 'messenger' more specific? Is it MSN, Yahoo or an owl?
You can't unless you get the pay version Yahoo plus.  . . If you want it free, you gotta deal with the ads.Sadly, due to Yahoo! inc. policy, you can only have POP access (required for Outlook and other computer-based e-mail hosts, so that they can access your Inbox) you require Yahoo!'s payment account(s).i tried figuring it out but ran out of time. your have to have the server url for yahoomail and enter it in where you add an email account in outlook. i didnt have time to find to url but its not yahoomail. its some long url. you can set up a hotmail account thats alot easier but you have to pay monthly to link it to outlook
I would love to know the answer to this question myself.  I take my time to answer people's questions sincerely and no one seems to care to vote OR to pick the best answer.  Something needs to change...Because people are too lazy to choose a best answer. They just want a quick answer, and don't actually read through what different people have written.Mostly because this is Yahoo.  . . Average age: 13. . Average intelligence: Below parPeople forget about the site and don't bother to log back on to choose an answer. I think it might cut down on this to allow choose an answer to happen immediately rather than requiring a 24 hour wait.. . As for questions in voting, if there is a stalemate, questions will remain in voting until it is resolved. Vote for them if you see them. Unfortunately, questions never cycle back to the top, so it's rare that anyone would be looking pages back at these old questions.I think there are alot of ties in voting so unless someone breaks the tie it stays.As far as best answers how hard is it to choose just pick one and be done!I sure don't know, but it makes me really frustrated!if no one votes on the questions they stay in limbo as long as it takes
for bs emails. You answered one of my questions, pick mine as best answer and i will pic yours as best answer.Spam and junk e-mail.. http://help.yahoo.com/help/us/mail/spam/spam-08.html. . For advice on managing it, check out the articles referenced by this Yahoo Search query:. yahoo mail bulk folder. http://search.yahoo.com/search?ei=utf-8&fr=slv1-wdgt&p=yahoo%20mail%20bulk%20folderspam filterjunk that should not even exist because nobody ever opens their bulk folderspamantying your email service thinks was mass sent to poeple, even if it really was notIt basically represents a 'junk folder'. Messages there are usually emptied in about one week to a month (depending upon the options you set).. . I suppose it's named 'bulk folder' because bulk, meaning something like 'large quantity' and junk and spam mail sometimes come in 'bulk'. xD Just a thought.
Your question can be deleted anytime before you or others vote for the best answer. Once it has been resolved the question becomes permanent and cannot be deleted.You can only delete your question if it is open. If it is resolved, there is no way to delete your question.so easy, pick the question n delete it in side window.
Well you a paper shredder to shred your addresses so people cannot identify you. Its got a advantage because its easier than to cut your addresses up. Its also got an advantage because you don't need a lot of stuff, (scissors and the paper doesn't go everywhere because there is a box at the bottom. Hope it Helpsreduces the risk of having someone steal your mall for your personal information.Shredders destroy confidential documents in such a way that they cannot be read by others.  Identity thieves, for instance, can go through trash bags and get credit card information from discarded paperwork.  Shredding would ensure that they could not read the info.just recycle. simple and clean
Just leave it blank. you can still vote best answer . Try it on this one.If you want too leave comments click on Comments.just put thank youyou dont have to write comments but you can by clicking the comment bardo not write anythingPut one letter or number in the box hit submitjust leave da comment box blanky not write 'no comment' or N/ANo need to fill the comment box. Just put a cheerful SMILEY!!! :)  ;)  :D
saying or asking things that are inappropriate. I think it is perm. however people have been known to open new accounts...I answered an extremely technical question after someone gave a very intelligent answer and typed "what he said" thinking it funny. I received an email saying I gave an inappropriate answer and it will be deleted. It was. I'm still here. I think it gets a review when someone clicks the report abuse button.Repeatingly asking a certain question, asking 18+ stuff on a regualr basis, swearing without editing it and other stuff. But yeah then can close your account but it takes a lot of violations to do that. They might close your account for like a week or so but permanently takes some real pissing off to do.
That is one good thing for reaching a higher level, the limit get higher as well.  Best wishes =)cus being it gives u a higher plus being higher lvlsThey won't be limited once you achieve level 5.  Gives ya something to shoot for, no?. . Keep answering away!!
They need imagination...They are probably completely bored which is why most of us come to this site and the same reason you are asking this question. I'm not trying to be sarcastic, but it gives everyone something to do.They are still searching for answers.i guess they have not got the answer they wantits called enlightenmenti think that some people aren't satisfied until they get the answer they want to hear. so they keep asking until they find someone who agrees with them.Because that person has problems.you tell me...because they want more points, hahaAsk them.If they dot't find ansver on first time,they probablu won't find answer on second time!
You cannot delete a resolved question since it already has other people's comments on it.... It is left in the system for others to view in the future and possibly learn from it or comment on it or vote or rate it...Sorry, you're SOL.. . Since you can't delete it, maybe you can explain something that you'd like to elaborate on.  Use the VIEW COMMENTS (#) red button- bottom left under the best answer.  You can then start typing in the space "Add a comment" and state what you would like.  Just an idea for you.It's not possible. I've tried so many times and failed....not sure sorry but thankz for the points.you can't...unless you can get someone from yahoo to do it for you.
just ask themjust trying to send message and make a relationship or dating or any else, so you will know and find them, good luckdepending on which email accounts you are looking for. When using Yahoo! you can search for account names at the bottoms of some pages if you look.
Good question, can you say bug in Yahoo Answers.Server overload most likely. Too many people keep joining and only ask one question, then make a new account. Don't worry about it though, it doesn't really make a difference in the site...i know, right? this happened to me and everyone in Yahoo Questions on the list of questions then it came back. i really don't know.Well you might have a problem with your computer or a virus. Your avatar might also be disappearing because you never saved you outfits in the first place. ( If that's what you mean.)You might want to ask your parents for help or maybe a friend or brother and sister. They might have experienced this problem before. Try pressing the rrefresh button at the top of your screen. The avatar might appear or click on a hairstyle. If the hair appears click on clothes, backrounds, and more. then save it.yeah, it p###ing me off i tryed to put it back on it didnt workidk. mine left 2!
When racing the leader kicks up dust and being left in the dust means that you are far enough behind that you are in the dust kicked up by the leader.. . Sometimes it means you never even started.it means being left behind.  you know like how when a car drives off down a dirt road and the dust flies in the air, well you are left there, outside the car, behind it, not IN the car with the others.  Left behind it in the cloud of dust. :)Synonym of Eating dust. You are the drag in the cattle drive, The last in the race, the leftover spinachsum1 dissed you!Means you were left behind so quickly that all you could see was there dust.It means being left behind, forgotten about, someone else being chosen over you.being left out and ignoredIt means someone left so quickly that they left a cloud of swirling dust... not usually something that actually happens, it's an expression.Someone left without you.during cattle drives in the 1800's someone had to ride "behind" ie in the dust to round up stragglers.
The scammers use various means of finding email addresses that are published openly on the internet. Guestbooks is one source they use. You can do a Google search on your email address, and if you find it displayed somewhere, that's probably where the spammers got it from. Scammers use google and also email extractor tools to get email addresses.. . They also trade lists of email addresses with each other and within their gangs, and once you are on one of those, you will continue receiving emails from scammers. If you do not want to receive scam emails to your email address, be very careful where you publish it, and only give it out to people you know. You may want to consider making a private email address that you only give to friends and family.For Scams - use common sense... . . For Spam (which usually contains the scams):. . I have used MailWasher for a couple of years and it does a great job. You can black list senders, and then bounce their email back to them as a "bad address".. . . Another, newer approach is taken by Blue-Frog.  It makes you a part of a "do not email" group and if you report spam, the Blue Security Site posts complaints on spammers' sites.. . . Both are freeware ... make sure you download the correct versions (free one).Dont answer any emails for whom you dont recognise the sender. Never give out passwords or bank details. Apart from that theres not much else you can do!Make sure you have your spam filter turned on and delete (without opening) any emails from people you don't know.If you did not request that mail or information, its a scam. If its to good to be true, its a scam. If they request "Any" personal information from you, its a scam. Block and delete mail from SCAM mailers. Report SCAM mail to your service provider
To correct bbrown's incorrect statement... Yahoo! Widgets is based on a technology formerly known as Konfabulator.  Konfabulator 1.0 was released in February, 2003.  Apple released its version of Widgets (often believed to be "borrowed" from the Konfabulator model) in April, 2005.An idea Yahoo stole from Apple--basically short cuts to information with out going online-weather, stocks, news, webcams, you name it there are over a few thousands and growing by the day! Apple came out with a while back in their new OS, now its being stolen by yahoo!In terms of "Yahoo Widgets" a widget is the name for a small application created with The Yahoo Widget Engine
Afraid not.  That's why it's called "invisible", so you can appear to be offline when you are very much online.you can't. If it's really your friend, you can contact him/her directly and ask.Talk to them and if they talk back, they're there.No, you can't.  That's the purpose of invisibility.  Just because someone turns on their computer (which auto-logs in to yahoo) doesn't means that their available to talk.. . So, if their doing homework, or having a really important chat with someone else, they can focus on that without getting stuff from everyone else.You have missed the point.  Being invisible means you don't want to be seen!. . You can send them a message anyway, and if they write back, then you will know!It is impossible to know. If you send them a message and they reply and they are invisible...then they are logged on.
You would go to create account and just come up with a new username.  :)like you did the first one.
ask her not to abuse your questions for her chance to rant and rave about topics not related. She must be lonely and or bored. I hope she doesn't stalk me for that one!If you truly feel that she is harrassing you, all you have to do is hit the Report Abuse button under her name and report her to yahoo.  Make sure you explain what she is doing and copy/paste some of the statements she has made to you.  I really hope this helps.She's a bored little girl. She's probably just doing it to see if it bothers you.. . Think about it this way: She doesn't know where ya live so she can't be a direct threat.. . I would just ignore her...she's just hiding behind the cover of her computer screen and using it as an opportunity to shoot down the things that her unfortunately small brain won't let her understand.i am veggy. and that that is scary i would find away to report her to the law. being a veggy or vegan is not a sin .hey, cherry red,answer my questions. i like stalkers.I would change your "nickname" thing. (the user name)change your username and tell her that she is wierd because she eats meat.  you can also click the report abuse button uder her username/picture( i eat meat and i dont care that you are a vegetarian)acually I am not stalking you. you have done nothing but slam everything that I amy believe in, such as being christian. You dont ask questions you complain about everything you push your  views and beliefs on everyone. if you dont believe me look back on bunny's questions and you tell me that what she says and does does'nt torment or upset people on here, I just want her to know what its like. she is a horrible and has no right to do what she ( bunny) is doing. if you dont like it toughBecause her arteries are clogged!  Too much red meat.she is lonely report her forreal realWhere is Cherry Red now?Maybe she's secretly in love you.Report her.change your avatar and name silly
Because if you ask a question it takes five points away from your total..  It sucks I know but I guess thats Yahoo answers way of getting you to answer more questions.  If you want to see the point system click on your points at the top.You are charged for asking questions.

Its very annoying to find mails with all forwarded addresses.. . One way to avoid it is when forwarding click on the arrow icon beside Forward and choose "As Inline Text" and delete all the addresses.. . Also, you can go to Options->General Preferences->Message Actions->and click on Forward as inline text, so that whenever you click on Forward, it automatically includes the message where you can edit it.Pretty easy.  If you are forwarding the mail as inline text, then you just highlight and press delete.  If you are getting the message that says "forward message attached" then you are sending it as an attachment.  This can be selected/deselected by clicking on the little dropdown arrow on the forward button and selecting which optiopn that you want.. . Sending as an attachment will not allow you to modify/delete the previous addresses.i usually forward emails as inline text and edit the content (deleting email addresses listed) coz it's pretty annoying to see those emails addresses from people you don't knowForward the entire email as "intext" to a new message box.  Then, simple highlight and delete the addresses and whatever else you don't want to send out.forward the mail as an attachment if it has pictures or as inline text if its only text.... then scroll down where u want to remove the address then edit it..
just becuase you delete someone from your list it does not mean you are removed from theirs...they can still see you online until they remove you from theirs. But if you have yahoo voice you can select one buddy or yahoo messenger member and you can select to have them see you as invisible that should take care of your problem!!It is because he has not deleted you from his list.Because you are still on their buddy list.  you need to block the person.  As longs as you are on their buddy list they can see you.If you don't want to talk to him, you should IGNORE or BLOCK him (depends on which IM you use - it will either say "ignore" or "block")When you said yes to you being on his list and it still on there so he can see you. Just tell the dude that you don't want to talk to him no more!hi you can block them, that way they wont know if your online, it will just show that your off line all the time.you are still on his if you don't want to get messages from them then block themYou can also set yourself as Invisible.  But noone that has your id on their list can see if you are online.  Best option to select only the one person to be "invisible" to is like what everyone else has already said.  Block or ignore button.
they move around everytime someone updates their blogs or profiles . . if their more active you'll see them most of the time at the top!Maybe they don't have anything other to do to update thier page.
How are you is a chatting question.. . DON'TS: You may not use Yahoo! Answers:. to chat or have discussions with other membersi donno. Yahoo acts weird sometime.Sorry to hear that!  People have been going crazy reporting other people and it's not fair!  Hopefully you won't be reported again!That is bizzare, I would use the link at the bottom of the page to contact the Yahoo! Answers Team.maybe somebody report that question as "report abuse", ... you have to be bored enough to do that
by asking some simple questions like how are you etc..rate some best answers to get a few more points, and don't ask questions. read about the point system.First, learn to spell, then ask questions. Spelling just might be why you do not get any answers.Whats an AWNSER? are they free? are they fattening?Ask your question at a certain time of dayAsk an intelligent question and spell it correctly with good grammar ----- ask fo rhelo with the questions --- and end with Thank you. . . Keep it shortpoor little abused w.. . A N S W E R. . there. doesn't that feel better?Well you need to ask more questions?  or you have to Answer more question to get points if that is what you mean?ask easy and interesting questionsWell if you are talking getting more people to answer the questions you ask, you have to ask better questions. Something that will catch their attention. If you want to answer more questions than what you are able to now, you have to get enough points to get to the next level.ask those questions that have to do with love.  you should get a truckload of answers with that.  or some questions like the one that you're asking here.Phrasing the question in a clear and consise manner.  Making the question part get to the basic point then explain further in the additional info part.. Do no't phrase in an accusitory manner.  Just state the quesiton.  Spelling, spelling spelling!. . I have notice it depends on the time of day. Late morning (maybe people bored at work?) and in the evening after supper seem to work best for me.
If you're using Yahoo's email, it's under "preferences."  They call it a "Vacation Response," and you can specifiy specific dates.  (By the way, in Outlook, it's called the Out Of Office Assistant.  With that, though, you can't specify dates.)i think it depends on what email client you are using!?

And why worry what the meaning of life is just live your life make the best of who you are and what you have don't waste your life wondering why your here!(*_*)make God happyAs concerns Yahoo! Groups, the meaning of life seems to be a poem about the meaninglessness of life. There are only six members, and the group is quite inactive so I doubt it means much. Maybe they need you to give them some meaning.The meaning of life is to not waste your life trying to figure out the meaning of life.to have fun enjoy life and respect what u have be grateful that u don't have to live out on the streets andthat u havea computer.... . even if u don't pray u still have a life...!!!Live the unfair life and then die.whatever you believe it to be...

No, the points aren't important.  If you do it for the points you waste your time but if you do it because you enjoy it then the points are just a bonus.  We all know something and to be able to share it with someone who cares to ask makes it worth all the more.points don't have any meaning. its just for fun. an incentive to answer more question. no one is gaming here for points i guess...no if u get more points u go to the next level. every level u get to u get to ask more questionsThat plays a Crucial Role in answer.yahoo.com .

Superglue works by mixing with the small water molecules that are present on even the most apprarently dry object.  Without this water, the glue will not stick.  Thus, as long as the glue is put into the tube under super-dry conditions, it will not be sticky in the tube.  Once outside of the tube, it start to dry hard, either by drawing the water from the surface of the object you are sticking or just from moisture in the air (which is why you can sometimes get the cap stuck on the top of the tube if you spill some of the glue).cuz it was told not toGreat question maybe there is some type of coating that repeals it from sticking if you find out what it is let me know.its lined with turpentineWHAT ARE YOU 5?The air dries it when it leaves the bottle.I DUNNO.ITS A GUD QUESTION.NEVER GAVE IT A THOT THO.It doesnt work on the walls of the tube.

Yes, the point is to answers questions but sometimes you answer one of those opinion questions that leave you wondering how it got resolved. Also sometimes someone will ask something that you would also like to ask so instead of wasting 5 points just watch the question.  I myself used it when i thought my anwers was on the money and I wanted to see who got picked for best answer!While it "could" be used to stalk you, it would be redundant.

They all have different requirements so I would check with the company you are interested in and see what they have to say.... Either call them or write to them or look them up online and read up on them...What part of the world are you in? That will make a big differance as to what airlines are in your answer! Try these links for info:. . http://www.flightattendants.org. http://www.airlinecrew.net/vbulletin/index.php. http://www.pprune.org .

I'm not sure if the weight restrictions have been lifted.i think Air France

To make sure that they aren't cheating.What's cool is that if they tested students outside of school without their parents' consent it would be considered 'illegal search and seizure'.It is simple...it is just one more way for superiors to have what they think is "complete control". But, unless the parents of these athletes are ok with this, it should never happen. It is against our rights to have such an invasion of privacy, this is America!!! If a student is acting abnormal, or has lased out on another human being...drug testing should never be brought up... and it shouldn't just be athletes, thats discrimination among students.because 43% of high schoolers are JUNKIES.lolUnfortunately a lot of people now-a-days, feel like the only way to make it in this world is through athletics and because the competition is so tough that resort to taking steroids and other muscle and energy enhancers.To make sure they aren't using drugs. Mainly steroids.

Catgut is the name applied to cord of great toughness and tenacity prepared from the intestines of sheep/goat, or occasionally from those of the hog, horse, mule, and donkey. Those of the cat are not employed, and therefore it is supposed that the word is properly kitgut ("violin string"), kit meaning "fiddle," and that the present form has arisen through confusion with kit = cat.literally, the dried intestines of an animal, usually sheep, which is used for stringing tennis racquets, and was also used in surgery for stitching.cat gut is sometimes used for tennis rackets for the part where you hit the ball with. it is made from the *ugh, shiver* intestines of a sheep, or sometimes from other animals, but not CATS! They can also be made for violin, viola, harp, or any other kind of stringed instrument strings. you can a bit more imformation from this site:. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CatgutA strong rope made from animal intestines....ironically, not CAT.

It's like a fat guy on a treadmill.   You really don't want to look, but you just can help yourself.The points.I answer stupid questions because I really don't care for the people who ask them.I've stopped answering questions that are outrageous. Sometimes I answer ones that are less outrageous because maybe the person really is confused, why not share your knowledge?its the question....like if it says help? and then u click on it and its LIUYGLIG and u didnt realize it...and then sometimes u just answer it ne wayIt's because we're human and we have opposable thumbs.bored I guessSometimes it's hard to resist. Although now I usually ignore the really dumb ones. It's not even worth the 2 points.Because its natural to be a little weird and nasty. If the person wasn't, would you trust them? I know I certainly would not!Because we're weird and nastybecause we want pointsMy problem with doing that is that those questions are the only ones I actually seem to know the answers to... I hope that doesn't make me "Weird and/or nasty." Hmmm....I don't but if you don't like to answer them,then don't answer them,plain and simple. Good luck.
A troll is someone who asks rude or stupid questions, or even rude stupid questions, and then goes away, possibly to some other site that is in competition with Yahoo!  They just want to torpedo this project, or they just have so little mind they don't even know what they want.  They inevitably violate Community Guidelines, and can be kicked out.  We need to be aggressive in reporting abuse.a little midget skank with redneck teeth that gets mad when u cross his bridgeum, hotmale.com, skydvng_freak, Me... need I go on?My former Father-in-law. You can find him at the bridge.Little people with big hair!
I dont understand the questionWhat do you mean?. Try asking your question again.Not sure if I understand the question but, if you mean what does one cost you can buy a used one between $1000-$2500 USD. A new one would be considerably more.
its been fixed,  This question is two weeks old.  :DIt could be your server or your internet servise provider or your computer is too slow to relay everything that is going on...or it could be that your computer doesn't accept the chat proxies or maybe your computer is too old to load the new version or it doesn't or cannot accept the cookies needed to load the chat or it could be anything like are you on a school computer? maybe that is the case.... . . Good luck.Yazak Rawks, messy is messy ;-)bcoz its already loaded wid many people inside the chat room :)Too many people on line at the same timeit is crap
You might reinstall it, but I would get YahElite.  It is a hacked version that works much better.Not enough information to be specific, so I'll give general answer.. . Corrupted program files.  Reinstall the software and try running the program again.  Most common solution.
It means it is an unread mail. Say that you start to read a mail but get called away...just put a flag by it so you will know that the mail in unread.it is possibly a hight priority mail..
It depends on which service you are using. In hotmail and yahoo you need to format it to rich text before you can insert links for websites and smileys etc,Just copy/paste into your email.

It's a private place where all your stored information can be retrieved.
The first thing is that you will never dream of anybody you don't know. It must be somebody you have seen somewhere but they may not relate.

If you are talking about Yahoo Messenger, then try YahElite instead.  It is a hacked version that worked out some of the bugs, and makes for an easier chat client once you learn it and set it up to your liking.type in the person's name and then right click you'll see an option that says add buddy. Or you can click edit and it will say add buddy to listclick on the persons name,then click contacts and select delete.theres a smiley for adding contact.well when it come to adding maybe the other person is not authorizing you to add them in most cases. as far as delete a somebody my case was i had to many on my block list that it would let me until it was cleared.
You can go by what you feel is the right answer, or you can go by what the person asking the question wanted to know.  You can vote for a comical answer, if you feel it's the best.If you answered the question it will not allow you to vote for it but you can vote for other people's answers.You have to wait until the end of the period in which  the question is still open for answers and before the question  is resolved. At that  time  you can click on a question in the section "unresolved questions" and next to each answer is a button label "vote as best answer", click on the button next to the question you think is the the best answer or vote "no best answer" which is at the bottom of the list of answer.Below the Discover Something New section which has resolved questions you'll find Pick the Best Answer, which is the listing of questions that are in voting. Go into the questions and you can vote for the answer you like best.
You get kicked off, and are no longer alowed to have a yahoo account under your name. (You might get a warning, but in most cases Yahoo will just go strait to kicking you out. It depends on what the person did.)it appears that nothing happens there are alot of pervs on here and they keep comming back after being reportedthey give you an advice...it depends you can get kicked off this site or just have all your rights on yahoo taken away
you have to scroll through all the pages, hun.. . look on page #16, you are just a little ahead of me.You have to keep scrolling down to find you.  . . Also if you answer most of the questions in a single category, you should look at the leaderboard for that category.  Maybe you're the leader there.You have to go down to about 275th to get to 8400.Because you're not a leader yet.ummm because I'm not being too smart -and I ask more than I answer?? Just a thought!I'm stupid
Click on toolbar settings in the toolbar (it looks like a pencil).  Click enable recent searches (this will disable it so it never stores anything), or click on clear recent searches(to clear everything but will keep track of future searches).In Internet Explorer, go to Tools>Internet Options and click "clear history."im sorry kid but there's no way to delete it. ur parents gonna find out sooner or later. i would recommend that u buy another computer and get rid of the old one. =)Erase the cookies.
screw around with it till it goes awayAre you talking about email like hotmail, yahoo etc. . If you don't use the account at all (don't log in there at all), it will expire by itself.I would go to the e-mail address and go under account and it should have the option to either close the account, or to delete it. (hope it works for ya)You usually have to go under options or something similar to that on the website that's providing it for youwhy dont you just dont check it out? i think it'll automatically expired after some times..u have 2 click on the box next to the name and there will be a green check mark after you click on the box then at the top where it said delete u click on delete
When you log on your yahoo I'm, on top click on messenger, preferences and you'll find the ignore list type the address in and you won't have to worry about those nasty instant messages, i do it all the time.You have an option in Yahoo Messenger to ignore a user.  Just do that, and you won't get any messages from them again.ignore that user.BLOCK....DON'T IGNORE....ignoring can come backgo to your prferences options, and click...recive ims from friends only, this should stop that
You are going to have to wait until it is released.. . To see what is coming soon from Yahoo! be sure to check out the various items on Yahoo!Next.just complete the yahoo page and then click on update
idk but could u email me this question when u have a answer that works? crazy4catslikemax@yahoo.com thanks!Use a nickname . In <yws-maps>, a certain gentleman,  uses the name, [................].  Now how's that?Your name really doesn't show--only your "screen " name or your email name.  Many people have more than one email account for different purposes; for example, a friend of mine has one email for most things but when he logs on to a chat room for recovering alcoholics and drug addicts, he signs as "beentheredonethat"  So if you want a separate screen idenity for some of your communication, try it.Go into "mail options" and delete your name.  They will still get your email address.  You can't block that (that would be spam).Options - Display NameWhat I did is, instead of putting my name in when I set up my account, I put in "Just Meeeee" so that is what comes up when they receive an e-mail from me.
uhm, correct grammar, how DO we invite our friends? And I dont know.There is a + sign with the smily picture, you can click on it and type the address of your friend.. Or. You can go in Contacts and click on Add a contact.. Or. In Yahoo messenger window click Ctrl+Shift+A same time.we invite our friends by e-mail or IM
yo can go to chat rooms. if u find anyone to ur taste u can add them as contacts and can continue.If you have a PC and your friend is also having a PC so it will be easy for you to contact him by yahoo messenger with voice(BETA).OR .

In the USA, archaeology is under anthropology. In Europe and most of the world archaeology is an independed discipline. Yahoo Answers is originated in the USA. So they didn't think we can visit it outside of the USA :)...Maybe archaeology is considered a subset of anthropology. It was at my college. I majored in archaeology, but graduated with a B.A. in Anthropology. The other two subsets were: Bio Anthro (monkeys and other primates than man) and Social Anthro (other human cultures like the Yanomamo Indians of the Amazon rain forest)Thank you for a great suggestions. We will discuss it further!in the UK they are separate, but usually connected, ie in Lampeter university, its the Archaeology and Anthropology departmentto des. hw; how can you have Bio Anthropology and study monkeys and stuff. doesn't "anthropology" mean "the study of man?"
Go to My Q&A, and click edit info. you MUST sign up to yahoo 360 in order to post a real photo of yourself. otherwise you just post the avatar like mine....... . hope this helpsyahoo360:) Dur???!!!
If you have Yahoo go to the main page. On the top right hand area it has a smily face and it says 'messenger'. Click on that and it will take you to the page that will let you downloade messenger.http://beta.messenger.yahoo.com/download.php;_ylt=AtpAn.p0xvUDxo.yC864Y3XsLscF. . and just let it run, say ok ok ok and voila!!! all setIt should have directions for you to. like on the help menu.What do you mean by Set up?  If you have a yahoo mail account, just sign into messenger with your mail sn (leave out @yahoo.com) . . If you want to make changes go to "preferencese" Be more specific with what you want to do. I'm sure I or someone else can helpNo spam pleaseGo to AIM.com and where it says download IM press it and in no time you will have instant mesenger. but if u need a new screen name it will help you out alsoWhich type are you using.... . it should walk you through it (I know AIM and Yahoo do)go and download it, then add names of your friends to it.  it's pretty simple once you get the hang of it!
Why would anyone at Yahoo! know? The easiest thing to do is to view the help section at msn space. You could probably contact them for more help.coz its private, i don't know if you have the option to make it public
you could ask yahoo. contact them.. try just resigning on!!! some thimes that works use your old username and pass.just reopen a new account and deposit the money that was taken out of the old accountcall yahoo account verification and verify the account and they can reopen it for you the number is 1-408-349-1572 option 2 and then 2 againWait between 90/120 days and open a new yahoo mail account, it will let you choose that name again.. It's the only way to do it.
go to any yahoo page, and look on the top most page to search for the MY ACCOUNT option. click it, you'll be asked again for your password for security purposes. once you hit enter, you'll be redirected to a page that contains your personal information, you can change your password there.log onto yahoo. (well, actually log into your yahoo mail). at the top of the page where it says "welcome" so-and-so, under it you should see "my account" click there. it will probably prompt you for your password again, and then when it opens you account info, click where it says "change password" it will ask for your old password, and then it will ask for your new password twice. enter it twice, and click "save".

That's not quite true, is it?. . I looked at your list of questions, and you have received many answers.I went back and looked at your questions trying to figure out why no one would answer you. All of your questions have been answered.Because your questions aren't interesting. Like this one. NOw let me go check out your other questions.....Stop trying to get attentioni am now,never seen your questions before but this one stands out loloh, what? Did you say something?i do cuz u said to heeheeI do.maybe because there stupid, just like this one is.Whats the question? Maybe its stupid or you don't give enough details.  Oh, we answered this one.Maybe they don't know the answer.I just did! I don't know why people aren't answering your questions.That is so not true.I can tell.If only few people answer your questions then maybe they are hard... Don't you think?I don't know.hello u get more answers than i do .. wht r u cribbing abt?. even i asked whts an orgasm and i hardly recd any answers!
u need to payI think you can use proxy server...A proxy server. That way your real IP address gets masked.A proxy server. Search Yahoo or Google for "anonymous browsing".
Because you need to sign in still. It is a security feature.Try restarting like they say, and you should find a link on your desktop to log-in.. . . Good Luck,. -Alexis
Msn has drawing and more emoticons.I don't know, I find yahoo messenger much better and my computer likes it, Msn always crashes on my computer.MSN Messenger is more popular than Yahoo!

People must be too lazy to download Yahoo messenger.it's a preference on which one to use.  yahoo is more easier to use but msn have better choiceseaser
Yahoo! is an acronym for Yet Another Hierarchical Officious Oracle.My first thought was of the Yahoos in Guliver's Travels...lol.I think the people were having trouble deciding a name for a new place on the internet and I think someone got excited about something and said yahoo! Then I think they said hey that's a good name for this new website."Yet Another Hierarchical Officious Oracle" is a backronym for "yahoo!", but the creators of Yahoo! say that they created the name because they liked the word's general definition, which came from "Gulliver's Travels" by Jonathan Swift: "rude, unsophisticated, uncouth.""Yet Another Hierarchical Officious Oracle" is a suggested acronym, but it's a word from Gulliver's Travels which means "rude, unsophisticated, uncouth"
Not sure. But I just had my Answers acct suspended by some guy last night. He reported all 60 questions I asked after he didn't like my answer to his perverted question.I think your questions were considered polls or surveys, which is a violation of the guidelines. I report a lot of abuse, but wouldn't report "who likes water more than soda" because I think it's a harmless inquery. I don't know if someone reported your questions or if there's some software or filter that can figure out that you may be taking a poll and deleted them automatically.stick to the rules.You got reported for using this site as a chat room.Yeah that happend to me a couple of times... I have no idea why..  One thing I can say.. is the time of day you enter your questions... This yahoo answers is based in the west coast so the people they have watchin for post they don't like are on at a certian time of the day.. Like they have a peak time were they crack on the, "bad guy"  not saying your bad... but you know what I mean... anyways... maybe you just put yours in around that time..they were proboly there too longdon't know, checked out your 360 page..... . i don't eat meat either, no harrassment there.  best book you'll ever read, "Diet For A New America" by John Robbins.  It's quite eye popping.. . love the killers too, great band.  rock on, keep that boy of yours happy, stay opinionated, that's the only way to be!it gets deleted when it has been on the thing too long and has been on for over 14 days. i hope this can be helpful to you. . - Amybeta problemsIt says that it will delete questions after certain days dont go ballistic baby.

I was born in October 1929. Nobody told me as I was not born. about 1920 and that was 76 plus nine years ago. I don't think they progressed very far.If rhey have not progressed by now and you have found out about it. Ask the new Pope check if he knows?. Tiger."In what did the Progressives believe? Some historians have argued that the Progressives’ context was political only on its surface—that at its core it was religious, an attempt by Americans from all social classes, but chiefly the middle class, to restore the proper balance among Protestant moral values, capitalistic competition, and democratic processes, which the expansion of business in the Gilded Age seems to have changed in alarming ways. Progressives wanted better and fairer competition and they wanted every citizen to participate in the polity. Such views can be either reactionary or enlightened, depending on context, and among themselves Progressives disagreed on practically every specific proposal. In other words, they agreed on the need to foster more morality in society, but disagreed about how to accomplish it. . . What methods did Progressives use to solve these problems? In dealing with nearly every cause, Progressive leaders began by organizing a voluntary association, investigating a problem, gathering relevant facts, and analyzing according to the precepts of one of the newer social sciences. From such an analysis a proposed solution would emerge, be popularized through campaigns of education and moral suasion, and—as often as not, if it seemed to work—be taken over by some level of government as a public function. The Progressives’ approach reflected both their confidence that social science could remedy the conflicts of an industrial society and their growing faith that government could be trusted to solve problems. . . These tactics were pioneered in many cases by women who had time to devote to activities outside the home—something experienced by more and more women in this era. These women had fewer children than their mothers and were increasingly freed from full-time housework by laborsaving devices and by society’s absorption of some of the family’s traditional economic and educational functions. They also had the inclination to do so. Women recognized that in an urban, industrial setting, care of the home and family—“their” sphere—was no longer just a private matter. Most men still gave them little encouragement to participate in public life, so they invented their own means to improve the world. Beginning before the high point of Progressivism but connected to this movement, women formed many single-sex associations, the largest and most important one being the Woman’s Christian Temperance Union (WCTU). Founded in 1874 and led by Frances Willard, the WCTU began by focusing on a range of problems including the welfare of children, but later narrowed its focus to the issue of temperance. In 1889, Jane Addams founded Hull House and thus began one of the most creative products of the women’s movement (and its male allies)—settlement houses. In taking roles on the stage of public life, Progressive women gained unprecedented experience in the hard work of shaping public choices, and this experience intensified their demand for the vote that they finally achieved in 1920. . . From outside the ranks of Progressivism, other men and women also presented programs for shaping social choices in industrial America. Sometimes they joined forces with the Progressives and adopted similar methods. One of these groups was industrial workers who, compared to the middle-class Progressives, suffered greater divisions among themselves and possessed less power over others. The Knights of Labor (1869-1890) and American Federation of Labor (that began in 1886) represent two different approaches to organizing workers, with the Knights accepting workers of all skill levels, both sexes and races, while the AFL organized only skilled workers who were male and white. Both groups shared the Progressives’ goals of abolishing child labor and establishing the eight-hour day for workers.. . The Progressive Era also had a negative and coercive side. This era saw the spread of disfranchisement and seThe Progressives were a political party that was also known as the People's party. They were formed in response to the two major political parties neglecting to pass legislation that would benefit farmers in the 1890's.. Mostly, they wanted to enforce an income tax, and wanted to coin silver.. . The extent of their success was nominating WIlliam Jennings Bryan as their presidential candidate at the turn of the century when he did actually win the votes of several states.

The only way is to ask to sender to resend the emailSorry gone.. If you need it and you know who it came from you can ask that person to resend it to you. They may have deleted it too, in which case you up the proverbial creek without a paddle.

You can't change the email ID,. but you can change the passwords! ^_^Changing email address (not just the name of the sender) really depends on your email provider. But as a side note, I think that it's rather impossible.
You have one already. When you signed up for Yahoo! to ask questions here you automatically got a free email account. It's your ID followed by @yahoo.comUse yahoo e-mail ,they are free.And you can also use yahoo messager.Easy just go to the home page for yahoo.  Just like you set up the account for yahoo answers.  When you get to the home page look for yahoo mail and follow the directions.signup from mail.yahoo.com and you will get a new yahoo email id.
what do you mean screen name? is that the email address on yahoo.com or your screen name on  this yahoo answer or the screen name that comes upwhen you send out email to someone?You can't. You were the idiot who chose a crappy name so either deal with it, create an alias account connected with it, or restart.Yeah, I've been wondering this too.  I'll check back for answers later.i don't know i've been wondering this tooI wish I knew! I have a similar question. I want to keep my Yahoo screen name and change the ISP extension. (eg.ScreenName@aol.com becomes ScreenName@att.net). I can't register the new address because my screen name is already taken! Of course...I have it!!!. Maybe the answer to your question is the same one I seek.Duhh you cant yall are a bunch of idiots that if you cant figure it out well to bad im not going to tell you suckers
Maybe your questions are either too boring or too stupidyeah.people are getting tired of this now its like a fad! ya know!If your questions require a lot of detail in the answer, you probably wont get that many answers.I don't know...Don't forget about daylight saving time. Move your watches and clocks ahead one hour on sunday morning starting at 2am.. 2am becomes 3am.Yeah, make your questions interesting.  I've not answered heaps of questions, because they were kinda racist, or childish, or just not worth considering.  I'm not referring to your previous questions.It seems as though you're asking questions that require most people to actually think about the answer or research it. Most questions that I am quick to answer are those that ask my opinion.maybe it's luck..also depends on your question..don't ask silly question or something too complicated..it's difficult for people to answerwhat were you asking??is the nature of this world.  Everything gets old.  In order to get renewed interest we have to make look fresh again even if underneath is the same idea.
well leaving aside the obvious: WHY IN THE WORLD WOULD YOU DO THIS - have you seen all the problems gmail is having!?. . But to answer your question since this is about "answers!" ;-). . You can only do this by signing up for a "Mail Plus" account (do this under the Mail Options menu).  It's $20/ year and then you can forward all of your incoming mail yahoo.com email to any other email address - yes, even gmail!!. . My recommendation - get the new Y! Mail beta - it's way better than gmail anyway.  you can ask to get an invite here: http://surveylink.yahoo.com/wix/p0473306.aspxIt all depends on your mail host.  Some services let you forward incoming mail based on rules to another account.  With others you can't.  What service do you use?Yahoo! doesn't offer free forwarding, like some e-mail systems do.  If you get a Mail Plus Yahoo! account, for which they charge an extra $20/year, then you get forwarding.. . The story's the same for most e-mail providers.  My ISP gives me free forwarding; many others don't.
When you open the address and put in the e mail addresses in you will see the place to put the names or nick names it's on the same page. If you want to add the nick name of an adress you already put in just click on the address or click edit some programs do it that way.  Good luckYou have to go back and edit their addresses and their is a specific box.  It is a great thing :)
You can't because you don't have a real "account" on Answers. You have a Yahoo! account which gives you access to Answers, among other services and products.I don't think you can.. You may contact Yahoo!for thisWhy do you want to. Where are you going?I don't know brother, but if you find out email me direct at neontracy as I too hate this shit and wish I never tried it and now I cant get rid of it either, so let me know too if you find out.  Thanks and good luck.
It means an unsophisticated person, one that is not worldly.. A hick.. A rube..

Not sure which SMx you are speaking of.  But one SMx is a type of antibiotic used to treat different types of bacterial infections such as urinary tract infections, bronchitis, ear infections (otitis), traveler's diarrhea, and Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia.SMX is a macro processing language originally shipped with the Internet Factory's Commerce Builder software. This was a relatively popular web server in the early days of the internet, due to the ease with which a developer could produce an e-commerce website.. . Rather than re-implement websites in more popular languages, like Perl or PHP, a small group of SMX fans decided to re-implement the language itself as an Apache module.. . SMX was designed to embed macros in HTML/XML pages.. . A good example of a macro is %counter(). This embeds a simple incremental counter on an HTML page. To include the results of a SQL query on a page, you can simply type %sql(<dsn>,<query>,%col(1)<br>) in the middle of an HTML page.. . Owing to the high-level nature of the language, SMX can greatly reduce the programming effort required to build dynamic or database-driven web sites.
FuzzyDice seems to have "rolled a seven." . I believe that as I type out my words I enrich my spelling and grammar, not to mention my practice at keyboarding, and in the English language.. Every once in a while I will intentionally revert to 'folksy spellen' but I still try to practice correctly as I can.  Josewatch out for your spelling of "correclty", it should be "correcTLy" if your trying to be smart..N dnt thse ppl who abbrvte evrythg rlly irrtte u, too?i recons cuz we's aint gits nos edakatins. . Or maybe they just don't have the right tools (a good schoolin).I think that's the question everyone would like to know the answer of.people are used to abbreviated speech, like when they use IM or SMS. . . People start thinking like that all the time and it is dangerous.Well first of all the net is from all around the world and some people are just learning different languages.Maybe some other people were never taught right in school or wasn't paying attention.For years people have been trying to find different ways to talk or type because they may think it's cool or they think it's faster to type or talk that way.Maybe some people are just lazy about it.
I did not know we could?I'm not sure but there is a help section in Yahoo! mail and you may even be able to e-mail and ask them.

depends. sometimes you don't want to show panty lines, other times it just feels sexier.to show their fat assThat is a very good question.. . I hated them when I first started using them and thought I would never get used to them. I now wear one everyday and do not feel it at all and if I wear full briefs it just feels wierd.. . The reason I started using them is they made me feel sexy and there as nothing as sexy as an a**e without a visible panty line.why do u ask these questions?? :Pits butt floss.so that you could ask this question!to seduce.

Chrome plating is a finishing treatment utilizing the electrolytic deposition of chromium. The most common form of chrome plating is the thin, decorative bright chrome, which is typically a 10 µm layer over an underlying nickel plate. It imparts a mirror-like finish to items such as metal furniture frames and automotive trim. Thicker deposits, up to 1000 µm, are called hard chrome and are used in industrial equipment to reduce friction and wear and to restore the dimensions of equipment that has experienced wear.chrome is  chromioum alloy which is meatle that wont rustit's just really really really really really shiny silver. let's say that.

I think that the government has to get it's act together first. There are a lot of corrupt government officials. If the officials get their acts cleaned up, they maybe there can be a mass movement to eradicate poverty.Eradicating poverty in any country is more of an issue of this... . What do you as a person have to offer that the world needs?  Is it a food item, jewelry, manufacturing, information.  This needs to be asked both on the level of the person, and the government.  What can I learn?  What can I offer?. . The Philippines has great opportunities in the area of out sourced tech support and call centers.  English is taught in the schools, and the people have great Christian values.  . . What can you find in your part of the Philippines, that people in other parts of the world can use?  . . I believe the people of the Philippines are a great untapped resource just waiting to be discovered.  Great people, a great country.. . To believe any goverment is going to eradicate poverty is foolish.  Only people who build businesses, look for opportunity, and hire others, will ever eradicate poverty.  The governments main job is GET OUT OF THE WAY!!They should make a law that poor or lazy people make family planing or control making babies so the poor people will not be more and more. Also all bad people like holdaper, snatcher, rapest and etc. Should be punished to death.

Atthe bottom of the e-mail you should see and are that has the name of the attachment.  You just need to double click.  If nothing is there contact the individual and have them send the attachment again.Normally, Yahoo Mail automatically shows a preview of the image, click on that and it will send you to the download page, then the image will open on your computer.Usually, all you have to do is click on the attachment.  Then you should be prompted to either "open" or "save" the file.double click on "download" in the body of the e-mail
Just like this one will be too! those are not real questions read community guidelines!! better luck next time!!They were against the community guidelines.Wasn't acceptable I guess.  They removed one of mine and all I asked was everyone happy that is was TGIF.they found out that you peed in the community pool.... . stop doing that!!!Maybe I would know if your question said All I asked was am I the only one _____________________________?. Without filling in the blank, and the question being removed, how can anybody answer?
I use a Polaroid camera and take a picture of something.  Then I set it on top of my computer tower.  You could use developed film from Wal-Mart or Thrift Drugs.when you find a picture you like on the net, right click on it and see if the option "save as wallpaper" or "save as desktop" show up.  If so, pick that optionI find a picture that I like, and then look for the tape.  Then I get pissed off because I have to go to the store and buy more F'ing tape.  When I get home from the store (not the nonunion Wal-Mart) use the tape to tape the picture to my computer.  That is how I put a picture on my computer.  Have a nice day.If the picture you want to put in you computer is in Printed paper get it scaned and and save on a floppy or if it's on a digital camera directly plug the camera to your usb port with provided cable and you will see a new disk icon under my computer. good luckDepending on what you want to do with the picture. If you just wanna save the image then right click on your mouse and then "save picture as", give a name and hey presto its saved. If you want to save the image as a desktop/wallpaper image then "save as background" or save as wallpaper.you can use your camera but you need your software that came with it and cables or if you have a scanner scan itWhat is your question mean,. Put? ............. output or input?

Hey I got 15 points DEDUCTED!!! I answered 3 questions so far.That's happened to me a few times today... it's something that the Yahoo Answers team should be contacted about.... . Does anyone know how to alert them to this problem?. And if so... could they please do it?. Thankyou so much!!!! =Dsame here..... Just have to hit your back button and then do it again, then it works.. . Must be a bug or something.because u supposed to press submiti'm having that problem too, somethings going on with yahoo!  if you hit back and try to submit it agian it'll work.Sometimes this server overloads. The only thing you can do is keep trying. That happened to me in this answer, just try again and again
You can go to "Options" on your email. The best thing to do is create a new email address. Next send all of your friends on your old email address an email giving them your new email address, next go to your new email address and send them another letter. That way your email will not go to their junk mail and it will make it easier on them to add your new email address to their address book.just dont open it and your account will be deleted after some time. you can make a new email address at the same time.
The best place to travel, is to come down to the Virgin islands (U.S.) and be a beach bum. We have one of the most beautiful beaches in the Cariibean. You have to travel by plane, and when you are here you can ride our island ferry and visit the rest of the islands. You start in St.Croix first and work yourself to St.Thomas and St.John.to egypt with b?cycle...and w?th no water   :)All mountain regions of U.S.by motorcycle.Because I love to ride my motorcycle.I would like to have a total of 4,maybe 6 select couples riding,more than that is too big of a group.My wife would have to go for me to enjoy the ride

We only think we are clean.  . There is always a little left behind and the towel collect some of this left behind dirt.  After washing a few times the towel is dirty.I wash them every 2 or 3 times. When you dry yourself you are rubbing off dead skin and any bacteria not washed off in your shower.To refresh them.  They go musty after a while and I just gotta have a fresh one.It is for the next use.So the towel will be clean for the next use.Because when you dry off...the towel is left wet. Wetness produces mold and mildew and starts to smell after the first use. That's why we wash them :) hope that helps!because when we dry, we rub dead cells of our skin, the after several drying with the same towel it will become full of dry human debris
Its not always rude. But in the chat lingo it is meant to say that you are shouting out what you have typed in CAPS. So some people might take it as a rude behaviour.It is not always rude.. . it is just SHOUTING on the net.. . is shouting rude ?. it is but not always !!It sometimes insinuates yelling or using a raised tone of voice.i agree with drstrangelove... feel free to use all the caps you want!!!Well your nickname on here is in all CAPS, are you trying to let us know something??It is all rude because it is like you are yelling at the other person or people in the chat environment.. . SO DON'T DO ITI don't know how it became rude.  I use caps in lieu of italics, to emphasize a word.I hate these wierd made up geek rules..like DONT YELL..Maybe some people can see the screen better if its in CAPS. It really is a computer nerd thing in my opinion. What if I had a natural loud voice and sombody screamed STOP YELLING YOU *******idiot or somthing like that? Now THAT is rude, but it dont stop the geeks from saying these kind of things on the net.Either you are in your pretend world or reality.
Kill his parents, grind them up and put them in chili. Feed it to him.Call your friends' house phone(When she isn't home). Block your number of course! When one of their parents answer the phone, say:. "Hello, This is Ashley from Planned Parenthood. I was just calling because ______'s pregnancy results are in. If you could just have her come down to the office when she gets home, that would be great! Thank you!" Quickly hang up! Haha! It is so funny to hear the reaction of your friend!!! Haha!
you cant. you jus have to let the server delete it over timeI do not know about all accounts of e-mail, but hotmail has a way.. Go to help,. Close account.. . or just never use it and let it expire.. . I even kept putting copies of e-mails in folders until I exceeded the limit, and then it got closed by the e-mail provider, I only did this after they told me I could not, and I was on a broadband. That way it did not take me a month of Sundays to fill the account up.you go to the search engine and type in "account deletetion" or "delete account" and there you go. :) i've done it before.You do not open your email account for a long time, then the email ID will automatically get expired.

tue night servers crashed down partway for 3 hours. 3-6 am e.s.t.i live in the abilene texas area and a few months ago  i had a hard time  accessing yahoo . after calling  local internet  providers and my own i found out that locallly there was issues of  servrs  down simial to yours they didnt give a time frame of getting ti up again. the hardest  part of yahoo is there isno customer service number.  you would think that  us paying for a email and other  products they would let us communicate to a live person. when that last time of servers was down i called a local  tv and complained of poor customer services with yahoo. at least with netzero for example they do have a number

visit the site of the company of which u r using d connection make changes over there. I did it on my spice phone and barred d company for sending promotional messages.1) travel to a cliff. 2) hold phone in most comfortable hand. 3) aim for the horizon. 4) wind up arm as to throw. 5) let 'er rip. 6) laugh and go get a new number.Unfortunately, while most companies have SPAM filters already in place -- nothing can be done to prevent additional SPAM messages.. . If you're receiving messages from a source in which you've subscribed to (such as MSN Alerts or Weather Alerts) and you know the source -- go back directly to them.. . A final alternative is to try and contact your mobile company and see if they're able to prevent it from their end (usually not).call your phone company and have it diabled. if it is set up through an instant messaging service go into the preferences and disable text messaging because on aol you can have it set so im messages can be sent to your phone.Contact your service provider and tell them you want the option disconnected.

Nope, mine isn't showing either, nor is anyone else as far as I can see. Must be a glitch with the Answers system. It'll probably be fixed by the team soon.Who am I?This is horrible. We all look a like.. . THE ones USING Custom Pictures still work.goneit isit is nowits showingit is showingI don't know no ones avatar is showing on mine eithermost people's avatar I noticed has become blank, like mine. It's conspiracy!!!You need to choose to display it in your answers settings section!You are back and beautiful as ever -- just like me!!!i can see it. i dont know what was wrong with your computer but oh well it is fixed now so GOOD FOR YOU LULU!!!
Thank God their here and not out with a badge someplace really causing society harm.They hit the abuse button when maybe they should be voting, rating or commenting on how they feel about Q's & A's. I realize that there isn't supposed to be a boys locker room mentality on here but it isn't supposed to be an encyclopedia either,theres other sites for both.We are supposed to be having fun.Go on the forum and read,they're all on it telling people how they should answer and vote.If it wasn't for fun people that can enjoy themselves like you I wouldn't even bother with this site anymore.Maybe if they charge some points for hitting the button they'll give their opinion instead of sabotaging people blindly.you know the reason why. You just want a compliment. Get over yourself.You have beauiful lips.Some people on here are lame. They kicked off El Pollo Diablo off too, he was cool.That answers a question I had about what happens when someone gets unfairly reported. I wondered if they reviewed someones Q&A before they acted. I guess not. I have never reported you!. And shouldn't a user get in trouble for falsely filing abuse reports, I think they should.I think who ever reported you needs a life.We need a dizzy blond on here asking dizzy questions.What are you people on here thinking?Like this is a learning place?You all let her have her blond fun!!!!!!No really ive never reported you but,you might take the hint if you keep getting reported.they are just jealous of you!. i saw one user called MURPHY, he threatened to report someone who asked Qs similar like yours (eg, how are you? what are you gonna do today? what's for dinner? etc etc). he said it wasnt in line with the guidelines. OMG, those kinda Qs are just being friendly and totally harmless!!. bet they were the teachers' pet back in the old school days =)They are just jealous that you are smart enough to ask questions that they don't know the answers to. lol Don't worry about those dingus'...they'll never make it in the real world any way. Think about it, every time something bothers them they are going to be like, "Umm, I'm telling!!!" What ever! Some people are really sad...OH  who would report you . and for what you are a cool cool person. oh whisper ive been reported a few times to lol.. YEAH EVERYONE ONE LAY OFFFFFFFF!!!!! MISS NURSE.lmao.. you have a great birthday tooooooooo MISS NURSE.Like i said most of them on here are total a-s-s holes. they feel threatened by your beauty. your intellect. and probably because you will not give them the time of day. Youre my buddy. i wouldnt never report you.Those B@$tard$!! lol they have nothing to do...we should have a protest!!!!! And MissNurse..welcomeback don't get suspended again...I find your questions to be fun and diverting. I've never reported you.. . There are FAR more blatantly horrible questions on this site than, "When is your birthday?"! I mean, come on! There are people every day that post horrendously inappropriate, inflammatory, racist, and/or violent questions all the time! And some of those people, for some reason, are still around....obviously you are offensive to the  narrow minded. try to bear in mind that there are no stupid questions only stupid answers. some of these questions are written by children and special people who really don,t know the answerscause they have nothing better to do.I thought something was missing from yahoo answers!My guess is that they are miserably sad and lonely people who's only enjoyment in life is trying to make others as miserable as they are. They may also be jealous at the response some questions receive and feel threatened that their own questions could only muster a couple of "yeps" or "nopes". This isn't The Mensa Club, if it were none of us would be here.It's a place for people to have some fun, and if you're not careful, you might learn something along the way. They need to back off and start worrying about their own Q&As. I can almost guarantee that if you look at  the Questions and Answers of all the people who send in these abuse reports, and I've checked, you will find a number of violations in their own front yards. Hypocrites.Awww,,why would anyone stoop low enough to report a nurse?. beside's you are very cute from looking at your 360 site ::)I think a lot of weak-minded people are intimidated by a strong, opinionated woman.  I, on the other hand, appreciate a woman who's not afraid to speak her mind.  I hope you are able to avoid the thought police this time around, but if not, at least we'll all know you went down swinging.  Power to the people!Well i've never reported you if that makes you feel any better.Some poeple are just stupid..just let it goI took the time to go to your profiles and check out your questions and answers (no not all of them!), and it is rather baffling. The responses I read are pretty friendly. Nothing weird, aggressive, or nasty. I don't know why people would report you. Sorry you are having a trouble.I'm glad you're back.I haven't reported you. I'd tell you my entire opinion, but I'd probably get booted off for doing so.....I dont know how those report things worked..Ive reported people who have cussed me(how they did it I dont know, astricks didt even work..Ive reported people who made threats to not only myself but to other people and nothing happened to them. Ive reported people who wrote in ARABIC agin nothing.. so why do they slam people for stupid stuff?? Who knows?cause people are jealous of you..esp the gal above me....what is her problem?
Well Yahoo does have it's bad days now and then.. . You could be tagged by a booter too.I guess someone has reported you as an abuser. you must contact Yahoo help to get the facts straight.you are being spammed by somebodyMaybe it dont like you! Just Kidding! I really dont know I have that problem too sometimesAre you a potty mouth or predator?well....i work with computers up at I.T.T tech. and they taught me that whenever you get booted off your program that means you got too much stuff on ure computer!If you installed 7.5, it is beta, mine was doing the same thing, complete, custom uninstall (remove all files), boot and reload 7.0 and now is stable.

I have my messemger on my sidebar with all the friends listed and when they are on line there is a yellow smiley face next to their name.  I don't always contact them, no need being a pest.If they choose to be "INVISIBLE" to all users, you'll never see them on unless they see you first and contact you.They would have a yellow smiley next to them if they were on.It will show you over at the side and then you look and click there name and talk to them it's simple but you should stick with msn not yahoo msn
Good point.  I'd like to see a spell checker on every window where we type in anything.Maybe there will beI'm not Yahoo team member ask this question to yahoo.
try yahoo helpi think you should restart your computer and then try re-logging in again. if it still won't work on the messenger screen, click messenger then choose connection preferences then on the screen that would come up, put a mark on firewall with no proxies click ok, then that should do it.try uninstalling it and put it back inyou need to delete it and re download it again. happened to me too. plus its a firewallThe following factors to be considered in order to find out whats wrong with your connection:. . * Have you set it that it connects automatically? (if not you will have to click the ico in the system tray to connect) AND is the setting (automatically connect) in the three tick boxes enabled?. . * Firewall, needs to be set so there's a port for the messenger program to communicate from your machine to the rest of the world. Depending on what software you use, this could require a few attempts before you get it right.. . If you have an older version of the software (even if you don't) then it might be worth going to messenger.yahoo.com and downloading the very latest version of the software, installing and running that.. . If that still fails, then there are other problems with your pc that you will have to get local technical advice with solving.try uninstalling messager and then reinstall....or turn off computer and wait for about a day or two...check on your firewalls and see if they are down low enough that you can connect to yahoo...
That  there is one aspect of Pharmaceutical industries that no one has thought of... I use to work at a NBC TV station.  I was the secretary in charge "Availabilities." That is what times during the broadcast day that there are openings for TV commercials.  The cost of a TV commercial is pro-rated according to the number of audience that watch TV at a certain time, also the cost is pro-rated according to the program that the commercial is played on... the time that commercial is played... i.e. at the beginning... (cost more - more watchers... than end of program... watchers turn on something else... so cost of commercial is less at the end of the program)  The age of the audience is a factor in the cost of the commercial too.  So... with all these factors... the cost of the same commercial that will be aired will vary each time it runs... during the day.  NOW the important thing to consider is... the lowest cost for a 30 second commercial to run is $50,000.00 for ONE 30 second commercial airing... and the most a 30 second commercial could be is $3,000,000.00 for a 30 second commercial to run... like in the middle of the Super Bowl Game.  If you total up the costs of one drug... that is being advertised for one day on TV... and that drug is aired 10 to 15 time in a 24 hour period... at the lowest rate of cost that is 10 x $50,000.00 = $500,000.00 A DAY for that ONE drug.  Now the drug companies make many other drugs that they advertise on TV so if ONE DRUG COMPANY advertises 5 different drugs ... 10 times a day that is 50 aired advertisments... and at the LOWEST RATE of $50,000.00 per one TV ad... that would be 50 x $50,000.00 = $2,500,000.00 a day that that drug company pays for the ads of their drug on ONE TV STATION... NOW... who do you think pays for their advertising budget??????  And with Canada that has government funded TV and no commercials, why do you think that drugs are cheaper in Canada than in the USA??????  WE ARE PAYING FOR DRUG COMPANIES TO ADVERTISE THEIR DRUGS...AND THAT IS WHY THE DRUG COMPANIES HAVE SUCH A STRONG LOBBY AND UNDER THE TABLE BOUGHT CONGRESSMEN IN WASHINGTON DC.  Maybe we should start a grass-root boycott of US drugs and buy them all in Canada... Why do you think that the government is trying to put such doubts about the validity of Canadian drugs into the minds of the US citizens?  So the US drug companies can keep their profits... and pay for their advertising... THIS SITUATION REALLY GETS ME STEAMED UP... as the US citizen is being kept in the dark... and again used for large corporate profits.Of course it is the badgering of doctors, unnecessary prescriptions and a drugged/drug resistent society. . Remember all marketing is wasteful and hurts us all.. . Imagine how much less each car would cost if the car companies wouldnt spend millions advertising all the timepeople use more drugs, which can be good or bad. doing stuff like keeping cholesterol or blood pressure in check is a good effect, but everyone and their dog thinks they have stuff like major depression and need a pill for it which is bad. also, it keeps drug costs down bc more people use drugs so they dont need to charge as much to recoup research and development costs, since those costs are divided up amongst more people using the drug.. . another thing i forgot to add, health care is being used more heavily since people are more aware of conditions and there are more drugs to treat conditions, so that is part of the reason (though there are bigger ones) that the amount of money spent on health care by citizens, insurance, and the government is rising
Are you sure they are out of town? If they are, why did they leave their yahoo messenger on?I am assuming that the person left their username logged into messenger on their home computer.  Yahoo resets it's 'AWAY' status after 24hrs.  However, Yahoo is also mobile, I can access Yahoo via my phone service, so maybe you're friend is mobile, and the last time they sent a text message was 2hrs ago.hii think that his computer free zed. and that's why it shows 2 h.. or maybe he changed his status bar in thisi dont know
everytime you ask question .... Uncheck the box "Yes, email me answers as they are posted". before preview ^_^A conundrum of a question isnt it?  You would have to get emails in order to stop getting them...... . I think they stop coming after your question closes.I like getting the answers copied to my mail...I always check my mail first and that shows me how many I got.I find that cool.But then again , I am a little crazy ,or so they say.when you choose the category, beneath that you will find a box to uncheck for emails to your account.. That will take care of it.. I don't understand why they make us uncheck it, instead of leaving it for us to chose.  Would make more sense.follow what the other people said
how stupid can u be if u have them on ur list ur on there list so how many ppl u have on ur list thats all the ppl that have u!!!!!!!!!!!!DUHI dont think you can do that.you allowed them,to add you, remember?I do not think either.. . You can do so with MSN Messenger, but not Yahoo. I tried to look for it before. . . Perhaps if Yahoo Team has time, they should develop this feature.
dont use friendester. its slowness will cause irritation to u.FRIENDSTER IS SO SLOW YOU SHOULD TRY MYSPACE
If you havent cleared your deleted items, you still can recover  but if you have deleted them from your Trash, you propably cant. You can only do that at the time of accienntly deletion. If you ever delete any email from trash, just keep pressing BACK button and copy the email content and paste it on notepad.. . Since i assume that you have surpassed that stage, only yahoo customer care can help youI tried but it will ending with nothing. Maybe you can call the customer care and have a chat. Hopefully they will help you to recover you mail account.
Open up your Preferences menu (File>Preferences or Ctrl+Shift+P), then click "Alerts & Sounds."  . . Deselect the check-box next to "Enable alert sounds," and then click "OK."Just try putting mute on your computer. if you don't want to do that check in the settings.mute the volumekick yourself in the headPress the 'Stop' button.
I'm pretty sure that's their point for logging in daily. You get one too. Yay!I don't think they are getting "reduced rate" questions. You can't tell from their Q&A page, but they might be getting points for rating a question (worth 1 point).
Huh?  There should be a row of icons above the message as you draft it, and the one on the left, should check the spelling for you.  Does that not work?The ICON has an ABC and a check under it. I hope that helps.  It looks just like the spell check Icon on here.
you can make rooms on yahoo?!. i didnt know that.no i didnt know all i know is u can have a yahoo pageBECAUSE USERS ROOMS ARE NO LONGER ACTIVE. THERE WAS A SCANDAL OF PEDERASTY, AND BLACKMAIL.
when you ask a question there is a square box at the bottom, near the preview button...it says something like "receive email when someone answers?" unclick that and you should stop receiving them.At the bottom of the screen that you enter your question there is a box you can uncheck to do that.
Go to your Yahoo messenger list, click on display image, share my avatar, click customize, This takes you to Yahoo Avatar page. In the right column click export, Where it says DID YOU KNOW it on the right side click it tells you how you can send your Avatar, I went through the steps, it should work for youYou can't until now, maybe in the future you will be albo to; I am only compling with Yahoo!
right click on the toolbar and uncheck itit is according if you want to get rid of it permanent or just til you want it again.. Permanent- go to add/remove programs . Temporary- go to view-toolbars-click yahoogo 2 the control panal and go move or delete programs and delete the toolbar and it wont delete messanger or anythingAll you have to do is go to "add/remove programs" on your computer. Yahoo! Toolbar should be somewhere on there, and you can delete it from there.
It must be your pc or monitor...they look fine to me.  You may want to try restaring your pc or adjusting your monitor settings.nothing wrong with avtars, adjust ur monitor settings.clean the finger-prints off your screen... ...sheesh!they're tired??go splash some water in your eyesur blurry
seriously? thats a piece of crump cakecontacts/add contactsits not hardadd a contact->enter the data -> done!!!Towards the bottom there is a button that shows the MSN logo with a green plus sign. Click it and follow the on-screen directions.
It was okay, kind of boring, but pleasant. Thanks for asking. How was your day?pleasant
Only the person who created that account can delete it ,they have to know the password and details.It's her ID.. That profile by the way is stored on Yahoo not on your computer and will stay there till the next time it is logged in on ANY computer. If your Yahoo Messenger is logging in with her ID ,just logout and back in with your ownjust make sure when you log into yahoo you leave it blank until you or your family want to log in. If you want to delete the Y! mess from your computer just right clik on the icon and hit delete.
It depends on what you are expecting from a penpal.. . Are you in it for a friendship that involves sharing personal information or more of a general cultural exhange? If you are going for the latter, i would recommend joining websites that that inclined towards a certain interest. I'd recommend a  site for inter-cultural exchange, but I don't know if thats the kind of communication your looking for.i don't think you can ,srry
i think when yahoo switched to the new format, unless your photos were in a folder on their own they got lumped into the "miscellaneous" album. unfortunately, only the moderators can edit those photos. it's a program glitch.idk
Yahoo! is testing a new home page on randomly selected users. It's temporary and you'll have the old design back in a few days.I didn't...I swear!!!it hasn't changed, unless you switched to yahoo asia or other countries.
Its a scam. since you are there on yahoo answers, so you automatically get those mails.. . For example stop using yahoo answers for a week , and the intensity would have reduced.If you didn't uncheck the option to send you emails every time your question has an answer (it's hard to find, it's at the bottom of the page), then there is no way to stop them from filling up your inbox. Next time you ask a question, be sure to uncheck that option.In the Ask Your Question Tab, uncheck number 4 step which is Yes, email me answers as they are posted. before previewing and submitting. :Dclick on your nickname and go thru your profile and click NO email.at the bottom of question, before u submit it, uncheck the box 4 gettin emails.
You cant have your own back ground or theme but you can have a background in a blog entry. here is a couple of tutorials on how to do this. http://blog.360.yahoo.com/blog-yhchwiM5cqHhPNgOYmmEm6cL5.gKaJ0h. http://blog.360.yahoo.com/blog-jEcmbjc0dqk_rpPWaMsN9SA-?cq=1&p=44i love designing things in the net but as much as i wanted to help u out i cant coz me myself don't have any idea too,. just let me know if u got the answer already
This is a good example on what NOT to ask on Yahoo! Answers.YOU BEEN REPORTED FOR "UNCOMMON IDIOCY"!!!!!!You could use whats known as a "brute forcer.". . It uses a dictionary of words and numbers, to use against the password. The process could be quick, or it could take hours and hours. . . Only other way you can do this is if you know the person fairly well. Well enough to know their date of birth (password recovery asks for this). Then you can ask them all the questions used for the secret question. Be patient, and you can fish the info out of them. Once you have that, then you can change their email. . . If your like me, I did this to an ex-girlfriend. She cheated on me and I got her back. Once I broke into her email, I was fortunate enough to find job applications and her bank account login information. I got her social security number, and drivers license number. I was then able to pull her credit reports and found out she has horrible credit, has major problems paying bills at all (collection accounts and delinquencies). I also used my ex's account to send threatening and lewd emails with nasty pictures to her friends and relatives. All the jobs she just applied for I sent lewd and nasty emails. She didn't get the jobs.  I ended up selling her info to someone I know, they said they ended up giving her info to a scam artist company who cleaned out her banking account. . . So hacking can be more than just reading their little love notes. You might even stumble upon personal information in the emails. . . She accused me of doing it, but I said "prove it". . She was too stupid to even know they could've traced me. . . Oh well, good luck with hacking.I certainly hope it is not possible.
u must be using slow speed computer and internet connection and clicking on the link more than once, that is y it is happening. Be patient when u click and click once only.if your computer is slow dont click on ur emails for more than once coz it will get confused. u just hav to click it once and be patient. hope it helps
there is a way, www.block-checker.comyou can't. . that's the whole idea behind blocking someoneyou can see if they are online (use link). If so and they are not on your messenger then you r blocked.. . http://www.blockstatus.com/yahoo/status-checkerbecause you are a super starSimple Process: If you are using an Instant Messaging System.. 1. Copy or write down their Screen Name. 2. Create a different screen name.. 3. Put their screen name into your buddy list.. 4. See if they are online. . . That is a good way to check. It might take you a couple of minutes but if you are really desprate to know thats it. Hope that helps you.
Start a yahoo 360 page and use your picture there. Then use your 360 picture as your avatar. Thats what I did.http://www.messdudes.com/
I think you have misunderstood the system.. . When someone answers your question we will see option of choosing that as best answer( after 24 hour of asking question). . And you will see option of calling vote under your question along with extend expiration and delete question ( may need two answer before appears).I did not know that we can change the voting settings in this way on yahoo answers. how did u do that.
There is no "Other" category. It was removed a few weeks ago. Choose the category that is the closest for your question.that is guidance to u that if u feel that ur question does not fit into any category only then u can choose other category.Not available anymore it seems.  Must have been abused.
When messenger is logged in with your mother's ID, you just need to sign out and login with your own ID.  To signout, pull down the "Messenger" menu in the main messenger window and select "Sign Out".  Then enter your own name and password to login.you have get your own accountget a screen name of your own, download yahoo messenger, with your email and name
Don't install them in the first place.. . If you're using IE, you can remove toolbars from Internet Options (Programs tab, Manage Add-Ons).  If you're not using IE, then it's not really a toolbar, is it?click on view, select toolbars and uncheck unwanted toolbarIf you roll over the bottom of your adress bar thing then there will be an up and down arrow that you can move, it won't delete, but you won't see themI have been known to be wrong a time or two, but I believe You, go to all programs, then add/delete programs and you'll find the toolbar there.  highlight the toolbar program and click delete good luck, Let me know if I helped You or led You astray.

lol well i think i am addicted to this because i love to try and help people!  but its also fun at times to read some of the Q and A's. Plus, its something different! God Bless!Because it is sooooooooooooooo much fun. I love Yahoo! I love you too for asking this question and allowing me and others a chance to answer, keep up the good work. Answering thees ?'s are almost like trying heroin. Have you ever tried Heroin, well are you on Heroin? Did you know that Heroin is the most addicting drug ever? Well I didn't till I watched an episode of cops. I love Cops, I watch sops and Americas Most Wanted every Saturday night. I think John Walsh is kinda hott. It's kinda sad what they did to his son, some odd number of years ago. Poor little Adam. Yeah his name was Adam Walsh, I think. I also know that.......................................Because it's some good stuff, man.Well 'cause sometimes there's nothin' to do.The answer to your question is also the answer to the following riddle:. What do you get when you cross an elephant and a rhino?. . ....Hellifinobecause it's funSome of us have really boring jobs and nothing to do all day.   This is why I do this, and spend many hours on ebay, myspace, www.ebaumsworld.com, and solitare.i do it, b/c i like helping ppl out with problems, look at my name...does it reminds you of a word/job? psychiatrist!! good...something to do.that all on my spare timeBecause is human nature to want to connect with others.  It is another aspect of human nature to be a "know it all."  As people we like to have all the answers.  I believe that this gives us a means of fill both of those very basic human desires.  Yahoo! Answers provides us with both a means to connect with other people and display our knowledge for the world to see.... . or maybe we're all just losers with nothing better to do...
it can't be changed. but the extra yahoo id can be changed twice a year.You don't.  You create a new Yahoo! ID.You really cant change it, you can create a new account. But if you want a different name for yahoo games or yahoo im you can create a new profile. Just log in to yahoo go to the games and click edit profile and you can create a new profile so when you are playing games or in yahoo chat you can use that different name. But as far as your email changing (yah yahoo Id NOPE)you can make a profile name and use it or just get a new IDYou can't unless you add to it. If you don't know how to add to it, contact me at valhollinsworth@yahoo.com.
They're right. Create five new messages and the old ones will disappear.they are not deleted.they are to be replaced.rather like religions.good question!..I dont think you can, but there is probably a limit on the number of messages, and when that is full, the 1st ones are deletedTry the menu bar. There must be a command saying so.
Once your question has been open for 24 hours, you'll have the option to put the question to a vote. You'll be able to do so by going to 'My Q&A,' and clicking on the question you'de like to put to a vote. The option to put it to a vote should appear in the upper right hand corner.You can put a question up for a vote when there are two or more answers to your question. To let people start voting click: Call a Vote.
well u might have chosen automaitc connection just unchek it. if it doesn't solve ur problem just try to reinstall the software. Or may u need to play with the settings of the messngertry loading a newer version???
Your points are to give you a sense of achievement! And to create a sort of game out of it so the yahoo people get lots of hits on their website from people that get hooked on playing their game!Just for fun, and because they know people likes to compete against each other, and out do each other.   If a could I will give my poinst away.  I just like to read the questions and answers,which ar both hilarious and ridiculous at times.I think just for fun. It gives me an incentive to keep doing this.it is a trick to hook you up...just a designated value to know how good you are playing psychiatrist  on line for free. The more points you earn, the more and more you want to keep on accumulating them to get to a level when finally one day might be invited to become part of their freelance staff.because they do it for fun!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!They are Yahoo's cunning way to make you ask and answer.same wayi dont know lolBecause they want to keep the flow of questions and answers, keeps it fair and even.
Yes. All you have to do is sign out of your account, and then sign up for another one as if you never had the first.yes just make up a new yahoo id and only give it out for buisness purposes.Yep, you can create another account.. . you actually have an option to use 2 email addresses under one account. . . here's what you do:. . 1. sign in to your yahoo mail (current). 2. click on options. 3. choose mail options. 4. under mail options, and under mail management, go to mail addresses. 5. you can add your business email address from there.. . after that, you'll be able to sign in to your account using either ID. you will recieve emails send to either address on one mailbox. when you compose an email, you will get an option to use either email address, depending on the circumstance.. . great, huh? i discovered this a couple of months ago. now i use one account for both business and personal email. and the people i email have no idea that i have the other address. :). . try it!Yes its possible, use mozilla firefox instead of internet explorer, there you can accessa as many yahoo accounts simultaneouslyI have six.  just sign up for another one as if you didn't have the first one.sign up another accountYes.

Otherwise, on the internet, click tools and internet options. under the General tab click clear history.control panel. internet options. click the content tab. Click the AutoComplete button. click delete forms and click delete passwords. . and Hey Presto
You deserve what you get.  You gave me a stupid answer. That is not nice.I have only had the problem once.I had answered my limit for the day.So I had fun reading and choosing best answers.I was getting errors earlier today but it seems OK now. . I would answer an open question and yahoo says "can't answer a closed question" (or sometimes some other error). I would try again and eventually it would work.go to the yahoo up in the left hand corner or call them.
click compose type your friends email address in the to box then type your message in the largest space and push send. You could find answers to questions like this by pushing the help button.If you're using Yahoo mail go to http://help.yahoo.com/us/tutorials/mail/mail/mail_basics1.html for a tutorial on the basics of using Yahoo mail. I hope this helps. Good luck!!If you are with Yahoo! you just clik on mail and then compose!
Well it depends on the topic your question the time of day and many things. Some of these questions I think people are just being too silly or lazy and need to use Yahoo's search engine first like you are supposed to do. Then yahoo Answers comes in 2nd if you can not find out what you are looking for in the first place on Yahoo Search. Good luck!Not very effective for me..  sigh but i still enjoy coming to this site it's kinda fun.Veeeerrryyy... see u got yer answer .. rite?!In the internet catagory;Great My other questions have mostly been asked for fun;Lots of laughsUsually people use it as their own personal soap box.  But some answers are helpful...Very! it's greatOh, Man!!! I have found out the titles for two movies that I couldn't think of in years.Very.For EASY QUESTIONS - 10/10. . For VERY DIFFICULT ones - 1/10. . and the range in between.. . I love it since its a lot of fun, beside knowledge and its FREE.
i think when you open your mail first time then you forget to sign out your mail. after some days your mail start working.upper right hit help
Go to: Messenger -> Preferences -> Privacy -> Idle Status... change the minutes in the slider, then click 'Apply'. For example, if you 'Apply' 15 minutes to your Idle Status then you will automatically go "Idle" after 15 minutes. Hope this helps.you set the appear as idle time to 1 min. then dont move the mouse or the keybord for a minute.
It makes me feel smart. I would still do it if there were no points. I need to make at least some use of all those years in University. I just don't like the limit they put on how many answers you can give in a day.basicly, yes. also to help people (or try to)For the pure enjoyment of it,the reason I came here, I googled a question. That is how I found Yahoo Answers.I like to learn and research. Hope that HELPSNope I like the Virtual interation & the chance to try help if I cannot necessarily, I like trying to see if I do know anything that could be of value to anyone.For fun.I just like helping people ;-)I like trying to be helpful, and it helps kill my insomnia at times.Yes indeedy...nah, I'm just bored.for the same reason why you asking this silly questions.. Ding Dong  PointsBecause I am a know it all and my wisdom needs to be spread all across the land of yahoo. :) It's for the points.No, I don't do it for the points because the points don't give me anything. I do it because I love to try to help people out when they need it. I like helping people, It makes me feel good to know that my knowledge may help someone out.I do it because I find it nice to be helpful :)because we all think we are wise and can solve everybody elses probs, also because some people ask stuff that can't go without an answer, it's to irresistable not to give your opinion.. Sometimes we just think we are sooooo clever.For Fun and want to get Some InfromationNo, because it's nice to help resolve issues that other people might have. Plus it's nice to see how good you are at relating with other people.
check out the link below . it's simple to useI contradict bluedaisy.... It always says "--- APPEARS to be offline and will receive your messages after signing in.". . It NEVER says the person "IS currently offline". . BTW u cant find out unless u pm them and they reply(but y should they?)Pretty much the same thing they said.  You won't know.  That's the blessing and the curse of invisible mode.you can't , but you can do it sand him a IM, and see's if his saids something back. . . *giggles*That's kinda the point of invisible mode.  They don't want others to know.. . You have to talk to your friend and tell them to let you know when they are online if they insist on hiding their status with invisible mode, assuming they aren't hiding from you.you wont know, just click on their screen name and im them it will say they are on or off line"The person APPEARS to be offline and will receive your messages after signing in." . You will see this is they are in actual SIGNED OUT MODE.. . If they are legitamately offline you'll see this:. "The person is CURRENTLY OFFLINE and will recieve your messages after signing in."just IM him...
i dont think there is anything wrong with you avatar. why do you want to delete it?i dont no but my best guess is to change the avatar from yahoo avater,by the way ur avatar is not very much bad,lol
change your password and security questions. archive all your messeges. add a 2nd yahoo messanger acct and add your name to it and see if it signs on.no idea but you could change your password and IDwhen u log on to one yahoo application at one time and u r requested for you password a second timearchive all you messeges and then the next time you log on to and look at all the converstations that have taken place, if there are some on there that you didnt have, then you will know if someone else is using your id and password, if that happens, maybe you should try changing your password, or even your id.
This is a Beta version of Yahoo Answers and there are some bugs. There is a Yahoo "Bermuda Triangle" effect where things are lost into cyberspace never to be seen again.Click on the 'Tell us what you think' link at the bottom of this page and let these guys know.. By the way I found this question,if it,s the one you are looking for.Y! Answers is in the middle of an upgrade according to an answer I saw from the Answers Team.  Weird things happen while they are making changes.  I saw your question just fine, so it's still there.Maybe it was in the wrong category. That seems like the most reasonable reason.The question is still there, probably due to the changes Yahoo answer Team are doing...
the short answer is you can't.. . the most helpful thing you can do is be there and listen.  you can't fix other peoples problems.  sometimes you just have to let them make their own mistakes.talk to herHermanita, it isn't easy.  Talking to each other is the only way, in the long run.  But people are gonna do stupid things, and it's not stopping.  . . Mia lindita and I have been together for 27 years, and we still do stupid things to each other's feelings sometimes; but then, we talk about it and make it better.
You earn points by answering questions -2 points are given for every answer you give. If your answer is chosen as the best answer, you get 10 points. If you ask questions, each question costs you 5 points.  The goal of getting the "best answer" gives people the motivation of giving their BEST when answering the question. If you click on the "level" in the upper right hand corner here right after the word "discover", there is the explanation. After reaching certain levels, one gets to ask questions without any penalty, etc. There is a little surprise that is given for each level that you reach. Hope that helps you. Good Luck.You get points for answering questions and they are not used for anything except maybe prestige...Yahoo gives you free wallpapers and stuff but not much else.Answer questions, vote on answers.   To gain and share knowledge - hopefully.answer the question and make sure it's the best. point are useful just to show others how good u r at reply.You earn points by answering questions. And you use them for asking questions. simple as that :Dby answering as many questions as you can..idon't know what are they useful for..i guess you use them to ask questions??Points have value in USA only. Don't think Yahoo would praise oversea users.by aswering questionsJust for fun............................. and to get more enlightened!The use is that you can use 5 points to ask question and you gain 2 points from answer 1 pont from vouting best answer and 3 points from choosing the best answer on you own question
Some users here are just plain lazy.  Them someone asks for something, I go to yahoo search, key in the search criteria, copy and paste the answer.. . They can easily do the same. it's just laziness.I think the 2 pts is the best reason.Some answers can be found by just putting it in the search bar.Because they're too lazy to write a real answer.Because of all what they said …Cuz people ask questions like, "What is the population of california?". All you do is go to google and type in 'california population' and it gives you 20 billion websites with the state's census, estimates, future growth looks and all that stuff.. . ALL DAY ALL THE TIME people ask stupid questions like that. hello grammas welcome to google.google it.It's because the people assume that the answer is easy to look for...it's usually not.oooooooookkkkkkkkkkkkkYahoo Answers is better suited for questions that require personal experience or knowledge or something not easy to find.  If the question is something simple, such as "How many ounces in a gallon?" or "What date did the Civil War end?"  It's either something trivial or something that most people don't know anyway.  Either way, the answer is easily found with an extra 2 seconds on Google/Wikipedia/whatever online source.Because a lot of people ask questions that are very, very simple to find on Google.Because they don't get the point of Yahoo answers and they just want the 2 points.for the 2 pts.  ( thanks for the 2 pts. I just got )Because sometimes it's obvious that the person asking the question didn't bother to look it up.coz of google's getanyanswer2urquestion attitude!!1) Just because we LOVE to answer questions. 2) We especially love a SHORT answer.  A short answer that's often correct, even better.because they assume the answer is online
no idea what you are saying, maybe you should try again in englishIf I understand..and this is a tough one to understand..Your email doesn't work and you are worried about billing??. Try help pages if you are on a free email provider like yahoo or hotmail.If you pay for your email service contact them and ask them..there should be a 1-800 number if you can't use your email or borrow someone elses computer and email from there.
Itching is the cardinal sign of allergies.  You should see your eye doctor to determine how severe they are and what your best method of treatment is.  Visine isn't always the best treatment.Sounds like you may have allergies: try an antistamine, or eye drops such as Visine (follow the directions on the bottle).  I have allergy problems a lot.enucleation.u should buy some eye drops. it stop itchy eyes like urs. its cheap in a drugstore like rite-aid.dap some cold water on your eyejust leave it-.. dont touch it.. just leave it itching and after awhile it wont itch anymore.. i had the same problem a year ago... but i stopped scratching and itching it and now my eye is ok.. good luck! take care! :Pget eye drops that have an antihistamine in them.  they are more expensive, but well worth it.  check the label.I'm not a doctor, but I did stay at a Holiday Inn last night. But seriously, most itching is caused by histamine, which is usually released in response to outside stimuli such as an insect bite or an allergy. Since its the eye I would suspect an allergy to a pet or plants (it is that time of year when things bloom). Get a good antihistamine and QUIT scratching. You can damage your eyes doing that.
You know you are depressed when you post that question.You sound very young.. when you feel either agitated and cry at the drop of a hat or you feel that overwhelmed you can hardly move with emptiness..

you should create a hypothetical book.you'd have topics about anything."What if.........you didn't meet  a friend,died tomorrow,were homeless,or were the only child".thats really if you had the time.sometimes i prank call people and then laugh for hours at their reactions.Develop a creative imagination.  Think of how to make the world a better place or how to create something to make you rich.  Then do it.Get with me in bed!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!lol...lol... . Naw'll im serious as fuck

You have already demonstrated that you aren't capable of following court orders.. Your son is either going to have to make extreme changes, or he is going to have to go back to  court with an agreeable third party for supervised visitation.  One that will perform the function reliably.If your former daughter in law succeeded in forcing that you have to be present when your granddaughter sees her father my suggestion is to get another court hearing and offer a schedule for visits. As long as your son has joint custody for the child her mother cannot forbid that he sees his daughter. But it might be necessary that you remind her of this in court.If he loves his daughter as much as he says he does he needs to stop doing drugs. Every time he lights up he is risking himself, and if she is there with him, he is risking her life as well. . . I have empathy for your son and your grandaughter. But, at the same time I agree with you ex-dil (daughter in law) about keeping his daughter away from him while he is engaging in such a dangerous habit. . . If he is really insistant on seeing her, and if he wants to be SELFISH and continue to smoke marijuana. He can always go to the court and plead for supervised visitations. Its the most he can hope for considering the circumstances. . . Help him find a good rehab center, stand by him. It will be a rough road. Keep reminding him of his daughter and the end fight of getting clean will be worth it.Well, he guy smokes pot, that is ILLEGAL, you were ordered to be there because the court doesn't trust the parenting skills of someone who would do drugs around a littel kid. You did not hold up your end of the bargin.. . The situation is all your and your son's doing. He should know better then to be using drugs and you should have been there when the court ordered it. DEal with the consequences.. . AND SHAME ON YOU FOR MINIMIZING SOME THING AS SERIOUS AS CONSTANT DRUG USE. I GREW UP WITH PARENTS WHO USED POT, THEY WERE NOT GOOD PARENTS, AND YOU ARE WANTING TO IMPOSE THIS ON YOUR GRANDCHILD?????. . HIS EX-WIFE HAS EVERY RIGHT TO KEEP THAT BABY AWAY UNTIL SHE IS ASSURED THAT THE ENVIRONMENT PROVIDED BY SON IS SAFE AND WHOLESOME.The ex uses drugs on a regular basis and wonders why the other parent doesn't bring the child around.  It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure that one out.. . You could take the other parent back to court and hope the court finds in his favor.  Ever think of drug rehab and cleaning up the act?  Do you really want your grandchild around someone who abuses drugs even though it is your own son?  You admitted you violated the original court order which means you have little regard for the court order or your grandchild.  Seems to me if you really wanted to see your grandchild, you would comply with the stipulation.  Sounds like you cooked your own goose.. . You need to think of what is best for the child caught in the middle.  Since parents are supposed to be the "role model" for the child, why would you even want them around someone who uses illegal drugs on a regular basis?Two choices, go back to court, if she has not already taken him back for violation, and make the Judge reinstate the order and bring her up on violation charges(if she did not bring him up on violation charges then she is in direct violation of the order) or bring the court order to the police station and make them inforce it.First of all get the bum to stop smoking weed. Then you will have to go to court and get it straightened out. Payment of child support has nothing to do with visitation rights.It's great that you love your son. . And it's terrific that he's a self-supporting adult. . And that he supports his child financially. . . (Is there any good reason why he shouldn't do that, by the way? I don't see how there could be? He's doing the right thing there, and that's good.). . I think a guy who wants to see his daughter would act like it, though. I personally think a guy using marijuana is much better than a guy who boozes..  . But honey, you have to face reality. Your son would rather smoke pot than see his daughter. If those are the rules about seeing her, he doesn't care for them, and he doesn't love her enough to do everything to make it happen. Now, maybe you do. But he does not. .  . Already he's let her down more than once. Maybe it's cute that she cries, but it's not good for her. . . And he's telling her by this, that if you say you love someone, it's OK to do that to them. . . I don't see that you can fight his battles for him. Nor that he has bought any right to disrupt her little world any more.. . Isn't it more important right now that your granddaughter knows she is loved, can rely on that, grows up to feel she deserves that? . . Why not apply for visitation on your own behalf, and leave him out of it?

If a tree falls in the forest and there's no one there to hear it, does it make a noise?It went to the Twilight Zone!  But I wonder if you will eventually hear from the "mailer demon," as I call it.  The little gremlin that says, "No, can't send that."Maybe it's been sent to a version of you in a parallel universe or maybe you've got a doppelganger that's using your old account for nefarious purposes or maybe it's been sent through a time warp or maybe.... . ...I'll just shut up now. . . Sorry.

star 69 is the option you have on your telephone service to find out who called you. example ( your phone ring you pick it up and say hello and the party who called you starts saying bad things about you and hangs up) now you're upset and don't know who would say such a thing. so you hang up your phone and pick it up again and dial *69, your phone will now dial the number of the person who just called you. now you can let out that anger.*69 gives you the number of the last person who called, unless it is a unlisted number, It will tll you it was an unlisted number.that's when u want to call back the person who just called u.  so let's say the other party hung up, and u want to know who that party was.it tells you the number that just called you and can dial it for an additional fee.  This sometimes cost money.It is a special service you can get from your phone company that let's you see who called.Use it to trace who last rang your home phone.  On most cells hit *67 to hide your number.  I use it all the time as a psych.69 is a sexua_position, so the couple that perform their best they are the star69!Its a feature on your phone that tells you who called you last.

go up to View - toolbars - click yahooWatch out, some of those tool bars are also hosts for spyware and adware. You may have just loaded a program that watches your activities. I did that on my old computer and had to jump through many hoops to get it removed. I ended up dumping my yahoo completely and reloading it (without the tool bar) Good luck. I know a free adware removal tool if you are interested. beach_man_45@yahoo.comsearch your computer for yahoo toolbar or find it through windows explorer. when you get the file use the uninstaller! then clean your registry.i don't know exactly but try right clicking on a blank space in your tool bar and selcting the yahoo toolbar. Unselecting it should make it stop functioning. But as to removing it im not sure i never instaled it.
your just gonna have to ask them... Yahoo! doesn't keep a roster of all their consumers like that available to the public... believe me, I've tried...Try Yahoo! People Search:. http://people.yahoo.com/. and the Member Directory:. http://members.yahoo.com/Don't know. Check help section.
key in your correct username and password with out the caps lock pressed. and you can see automatically after u log in who's online and who's not. oktype in your user name and p-word
The problem with getting into chat rooms is usually your computer settings. Try adjusting the security levels and make sure that you are not behind a firewall.thats my problem too... i am always signed out when i try to get into chatrooms... but its good because i discover this yahoo answer site.Because you're below 18 , next time you create an ID , say your birth year is 1976 or something .
maybe yahoo removed itSometimes Yahoo will catch them from someone reporting abuse because of the content and automatically delete them. We don't need to use "foul" language or hurt anyone's feelings.....I had three deleted today because Yahoo people said it wasn't a question. That's why I have begun to invite special friends to my 360 page to read my messages. Good luck !!!!!It was against the community guidelines.If it was inappropriate and someone reported it, it was deleted by Yahoo. . . Naughty, naughty!cus they dont like umaybe its violating the community guideline. usually there is an email sent to you that u violate the guide line.. ive had my questions deleted too T_T because im asking about point gaming.. sob..maybe someone reported abuse
expired n retiredsomeone else has it nowIt could be a number of reasons:. . A: Someone else has it. Which is really common.. . B: It has Expired. Which is also common if you haven't used it in ten years.. . C: You're typing in the wrong username, check your spelling.. . D: It's probably time you get a new username anyway, you are ten years older and that name probably doesn'y even fit your style anymore. Pick A New One!when was the last time you used it? if its been a long time they close the account.b/c its old.... ur 10 years older.....get a new one that fits you betterNo, no, noooo... Once an account has been created in Yahoo with an original name by someone, and you lose the account by either yahoo deleting it because you were naughty, or you just haven't visited it in a long time past four months (or three, I'm not completely sure) and you forgot the birthday you used if it wasn't yours when opening it, or for some strange reason you yourself deleted it, and later changed your mind and wanted to open it again, (all the names that have been used are on a list and cannot be used again by anyone else because all Yahoo account usernames have to be UNIQUE. Once used, it cannot be used again.) I stand corrected - Due to the limited number of user ID's available, after 90 days the name will be open for someone else to use it again, or yourself if someone else hasn't taken it. This is also something that has changed since years gone by. I originally opened my Yahoo account back in 1998If you mean your ID you can use it IF nobody worldwide hasen't take it yet.. You cannot check your e-mail if you haven't checked it before 90 days, after those 90 days your e-mail is gone you cannot be able to check your e-mail once again.. Or at least if you want to open a new account.Maybe it has expired, but what is the problem if you use another one??maybe because it old
Put them on your ignore list.  You shouldn't have too many problems after that.I dont think u can do it unless u hack their account.i wanted to do the same,but i dont know how.You can put them on your ignore list, they wont know you've done this. But it wont delete your name off their listI don't think you can..Try putting offensive party member on an "Ignore" list. Their contact list is their own...you can't change any info on an-others computer unless you're a super hacker. But I don't recommend it.
The answer's above and you can have rss feed update.  A blast to send out messages and it's easy to use.It's a Yahoo! feature which allows you to create photo albums, upload photos, create blogs, create an ever growing network of friends, etc. all on your 360' page.

The Yahoo! 360 site is experiencing some glitches.  They may be doing some maintenance or enhancements.  This is a typical error when web services are suspended, diabled, or otherwise unavailable.Yahoo has had trouble with 360 todaybecause I get them too.  They must be having a problem again. And again. And again.I think that yahoo is having problems with 360 because everyone is getting the same error message.  my advice is to just keep check back ever once in awhile and see if it has come back up yet.Coding, CPU, get help from a profetionalLots of us are having trouble with 360.. . Started with me today (april 30, at about 6:15 pm est.)everyone is having the same problem. yahoo most be doing some work :P just keep checking, mine came back
well yahoo team has already given you 100 points from the start dont you consider this enough to ask questions 100 / 5 = 20 free question. if you want to ask more you have to earn points by answering. . plus the site is called answers & not questions ..DUHHHHHThey charge points so that people will be motivated to answer questions to earn back the difference.I know it's rough. But if you read the terms when you signed up, you would have known that asking costs 5 points. But the good news is that for every question you answer, you get 2 points. And if someone chooses your answer as the best answer, you get 10! Isn't that spectacular? But what are these points really going toward anyway? So it really doesn't matter. Don't be sad.When you ask a question you  have 5 points taken away, Every one does, its not just you. It is the way the yahoo answers was made.It costs 5 points to ask a question.When you ask a question you lose 5 points. If you keep asking questions, eventually you're going to lose all your points.That's the name and game of yahoo answers, if you want to ask a question you have to help other people answer their questions. If you don't though, yahoo gives you 100 points that you can ask questions with.
tools - internet options - clear historyI had trouble figuring it out as well, but I read in this toolbar help section, and found out that you press the button next to the search box, (toolbar settings) and select 'Clear Search History'I just figured this out myself! you go to the top of the page to "tools" then scrool down to "internet options" then click the tab that says "content" then go to the button that says "auto complete" unclick everything then click "clear forms" and click "clear passwords" then "ok" and it should work!!tools= internet options=clear history=files, and so ongo to the search bar. . push the downward button and when the it highlights the word,. push delete.. works all the time.. . for search engines like google.. click on the search box.. push down.. and delete w/e you want.

If your local government doesn't provide the service, you have to pay for it. Try http://www.infospace.com and see what you can turn up for free.Unfortunately... cannot unless spending money to do so and even at that, I would not trust the people taking money...You can usually look up someone's criminal record just by going to the courthouse and asking for it. Unless the record is sealed (or if they were a juvenile when they were convicted) anyone can access those records. It's a lot more work than looking for it online, but if you look in the right county (make sure it's the county that the person was arrested/convicted in) you should be able to find results.. . Of course, it depends on the state, and some clerks may not be as cooperative as others. They may look at you funny, but if you really want to know, it's worth the trouble.This is just a tip, but, try going to your local probation office saying a person has applied for a job with you and you want to know if he or she has a criminal record ! Trust me on this one, it works !Listen to "Lanani."  I think that is how she screens her potential paramours.  :))I don't know what state you are in but I'm in Wisconsin and for someone's record in Wisconsin you can go to http://wcca.wicourts.gov/index.xsl. Just click on the I Agree button. Then you can type in the person's name and search for their criminal record.  Hope I could help.
To the best of my knowledge, you cannot change it.  You can however, open a new account with a different name.I think that if you go to the home page then click on your name next to the "Hello'....then go to edit my info....then go to the box marked "use another nicknmae" and check that and then enter your new nickname in the space provided.yes

Next time he emails you try pressing "Reply" instead of "compose new" that way you are replying to the correct address and they should get to him.. The address you have may be out by one letter or may even have one dot in the wrong place,if its not exactly right it won't workThere may be one slight difference in the email addresses (i.e. an underscore _ etc...).. . Recommend comparing them closely.You might have a system blockage or a firewall that is preventing you from sending and receiving messages. If you know someone who is good with computers maybe they can do it for you. Sometimes when I receive this message, it usually means that there is a discrepancy in my email address i.e. such as a certain word or letter that could be wrong, or capitalization might be on when it is not required, or vice versa. If you know of no one who can fix this problem for you, then try visiting your local Circuit City and having a Computer Repair engineer come your place to fix it.

Check with the insurance bureau. I believe they have to take the cheapest of the estimates. Your insurance agent is there to help you, hopefully they can advise you of your rights.Take it to court to prove the inflated bill and the unusual length of a car rental. May be grounds for fraud. Take three possible estimates of repair bills to prove your case."A pint of sweat will save a gallon of blood." -General George S. Patton, Jr.is this the other car owner submitting you the estimates? if so do not pay that, tell them about your estimates then say this is what ur getting end of story, sounds like this person is trying to scam you. good luckI'd be fightin' this one....they are scamming you, and only you can stop them !! Stop them !!Present this info to your insurance company, and dispute the charge. Then take it to court.Maybe they are doing a backyard job.A lot of people get their quotes from others they know. Sometimes they split the money. i know this is not right, but some people are crooked. Get your own estimates and see what the difference is. Show the difference to these people. Take to court if necessary. Compromise with these people.well they certainly upped the charge. They should have some sort of board you can go to to complain because the quote and actual work was so out of line. Get a good explanation of the increase in charges and then search for a local govt agency to help you.take them to court and prove your caseYour no claims will probably work out cheaper than a court case.. . But call their bluff and threaten court action.This is a bit like shutting the stable door after the horse has bolted but if you have a no claims bonus it pays to pay the extra for bonus protection, I would certainly get the presenter of the bill to justify the amount. further more it is a crummy insurance company that does not allow at least one accident a yeartry Swintons next time it is due ----no I don't work for themTell them that you will not personaly pay them, you will pay the repair shop, and a repair shop chosen by you. If they refuse then either threaten court or just take it to insurance. You never know maybe these people are getting cheated and don't know they can get it cheaper, if this was their first and only quote. At first give them the benifit of the dought and try and work with them. If you find out they are realy trying to cheat you and won't  back down, then do what you have to do, but stay fair, don't want to be like them. Good luck!!If you do not want to involve your insurance company , you will have to pay what was presented to you and accept.because they probaly wasn't thinking about thatInsurance please!if they were just dents& u r getting more than wat u spent then just go for itnotify your insurance anyway to report the scam you don't have to submit a claim to get honesty from them and if the company gets a hold of them they might look at the estimate a little differently than if they are dealing with  an individual
i dont have any idea but i miss it. everyone is so crazy on it nowwe are all here.yes they doit is unsafebecause they are busy answering q/a here at yahooit is so passe.
to upload a pic you need yahoo 360. . click your name - edit my info - create my 360 account ... it's freeOn the left hand side of your email screen there is an icon. the second one down you will most likely see it there.
Assuming you have it spelled correctly, the name will appear as a dotted underlined name to show you that you can now click on that name for more information... . It will take you to a page with more information for that celebrity... . . If it is not underlined, then there is a possibility it may be spelled wrong, or there is no available information on that person...Thats the Y search feature on Y Messenger...the more sites mention that celeb the more chances they have of being underlined. Tom Cruise asked a Q on Answers and Answers is Yahoo,Messenger uses Yahoo search so Tom Cruises name will be underlinedMaybe it's their own way of being distinctive from the rest of the crowd. And for those who don't have dots, maybe it's their own way of hiding amongst the larger crowd.LOL WHO KNOWS MAYBE THEY JUST USE IT TO UNDERLINE IMPORTENT NAMES .......:)I think only celebrities will know that.
mine's working. Have you tried refreshing the page?rrrrrrrrrrrrreeeeeeefrrrrrrreeeeeeessssssssshhhhhhhhhhhMaybe Yahoo doesn't like you any more.Try logging off of your computer and logging on again; or check your internet connection. Or just wait for the site to start working again.

Google gave me a hit for someone's answer. It was perfect, so I looked around some more. I think I've lost ten hours of my life since, and that was four days ago!There was a banner ad on the Yahoo! homepage in December. I've been here ever since.i forget too.  but i wanted to find out more about chiropractors and ended up here myself.I was sent a mass email invite.I just clicked on it by chance instead of news and got hooked.I heard a feature on it on the radio and thought it sounded interesting. That was early February and I am now 14000 points and counting.just surfing around on yahoo homeextremity of no life and broken bonei accendently clicked on it instead of the search bar to typeI saw it on my toolbar next to games, music and personals and I just clicked on it one day. Now I am hooked.
Probably because people want "opinions" from others, not necessarily fact or statistics.. . It's all in fun.. . If I want to know someone that truly matters, I will go to the proper source.. . If I want to know has someone ever tried something from an infomercial, I'll ask here.Good point! If I wanted a factual, authoritative answer to an important question, I wouldn't ask it here. I think this service has turned into a chat room for some people and a way for some people to expose themselves (figuratively speaking) to thousands of people, and do it anonymously. I think it's the social and community aspects that keep people coming back. Not the quality of the questions or answers.Well can you ask the librarian how to deal with a nasty stain on your favorite shirt? I guess you could but why?lmao...yeah im sure they would be overjoyed with all the 'how do i make my penis bigger?' and 'how do i find true love' questions. Get real.i'd rather rely on unreliable answers provided by uneducated and moronic strangers who get a kick out of writing stupid answers to serious questions.Because professionals actually do read these and give accurate answers. Believe it or not. Not to mention this is much more entertaining.Well, actually I did try that but the librarian became agitated with my constant demand for answers. So I started calling looking for questions I could provide answers to.  Now I'm answering the questions of local law enforcement.  Did you know we have annoyance and stalker laws?  :::smirks:::  Anyone know a good lawyer?  LOLGood point.  In fact as you must have internet access to use the service, why not google?. . However, if you're looking for recommendations or opinions this could be a very good service (if you could see the wood for the trees).Public library doesn't answer your questions; but, they do tell you where you can find it!  It's all about the online revolution!.   D?sirent ardemment de phase la r?volutionbecause it is funnier to see other peoples point of view and or dumbass answers :)this is faster, and gas prices are getting out of hand.why didn't you?that's a good question?....so why aren't u at the library?...why are u here?  :)OH, why, my goodness!  Why didn't we think of that?  What a good idea...call the local library where they employee many professionals from all walks of life and who are specialized in philosophy, mathmatics, science, spirituality and so forth!  Why don't you give them a call right now?this is faster and more at your choice if you didn't understand any question then you will ask here but if you didn't understand questions and lessons from book then you will contact the author?. this is faster????....
yes you surely can!  when you signed in to yahoo messenger, make sure that the box for "Automatically sign in" is unchecked.  That way, when you open your computer, will be there at the background and will only connect when you click on it.Or...once you open it...go under Preferences...General...and make sure the box that says "log on at start up" is unchecked.
u go to messenger &go to login option at the top .... in that see there will be an option as MY PROFILES . go to that and u can change ur profile...Leave it to your 3-year old or to your grand mom as convinient...
no.I do . Don't mind the mean replies though . Just ignore them .yeah you smell like dookieyour weird
may b u havent added dare site address 2 block it. go 2 mail options den go 2 block address, then copy & paste all the sites u want deleted.not every e-mail you get in bulk is spam, at least not for everyone. and if it wasn't and you had read it and wanted to get rid of it you would have to move it to the inbox first or else you wouldn't be able to get e-mails from that person.The quickest way I have found to do this is to select the spam in your bulkmail folder and then select 'move..to inbox'. Once the spam is in your inbox select it again and press the 'spam' button. Then, as long as your SpamGuard is set-up to block spam addresses, the mail is deleted and added to your blocked address list.
check in your spam or bulk folder.... it may be sending them there.  We have the same problem here at my work when a customer asks for a price list when we send it most of the time it goes in to the spam folder then they call us a week later and yell at us for not sending ityour office may have a block?

Yahoo just added the capability of adding 1 other email account to your principal account so you could receive the mail from both. the second one is color coded. I'm trying to do the same thing, but you first have to get the POP address. Then yahoo steps you thru the process.Unfortunately, this isn't possible even if you have a premium account for one of them. A premium account is required both to provide POP access and to receive POP messages.. . Other than registering the second account as a premium service, you may also want to consider just adding a second email address to your premium account so you can get them both in the same inbox. You can't use the email address you already have, but if you're interested you can get started by clicking on "Options" in the upper right corner of your inbox and then on "Mail Addresses."Yes forward pop account to other account
Looks like a bug - email to yahoo Help is best, I think.. . Easiest solution is to stop doing "extend expiration".it must have been deleted
You already have an account with yahoo. Use that in messenger just like you use it for your e-mail to log in. You may have to add your friend's  Yahoo IDs in the messenger to chat with them.. If you don;t have a messenger, then install it from the link belowJust download it off the site and use your yahoo email account with the same id and password.Since you already have a Yahoo! account go to the front page of http://www.yahoo.com and go to messenger on top.  Depending on your modem speed it may take up to 30 minutes to install.Go to the home page www.yahoo.com . then u select the messenger icon on the home page. now you will be forwarded to the next page from there you can download the yahoo messenger and install it. login with the same userid and password as you did for yahoo answers. Thats it.
YOU WOULDNT HAVE ANY!! SOMEONE JUST TOOK IT!!   LOLu need to use spell check b4 u submit your questionnothing
Yahoo is planning to open new business in Poland as Google. Today you can get mailbox in yahoo.pl domain.Yahoo doesn't have any servers in Poland or Africa.
I don't know for sure but I think there is a limited interest from yahoo to make messenger fully featured for linux. Since there is already programs doing that kind of stuff (ie gaim) which is probably preferred by most linux users for it's support of multiple protocols (ICQ/MSN/Yahoo/Jabber/etc). Yahoo is a business and if there is no money to be made, they won't spend the time to upgrade their messenger... also, good Linux (C/C++) programmers are kind of rare. But keep asking for it, if there is a bigger demand they might see the opportunity.I think there found another chat programs such as gaim and kopetethats not a question eitherwhy?
it means the very moment a new message arrives, you'll get an alert telling you. not within the day, or the hour, or even the minute, but the very second the message appears. or so they claim. ;)It means that as soon as new message arrives, they'll let you know (by using a small icon in the Toolbar).the exact moment the new e-mail is receivedthat means as soon as a new message is recievedthe exact moment the new e-mail is received. and by the way u are using to Yahoo!

Good luck! :)simply ask themclick on their avatarSearch for their name or ask them!
Under the search box, you can click on Advanced Search and then search by Nicknames of Askers using your friend's email name.. . However, Yahoo! Answers allows you to create an anonymous nickname separate from anything else on Yahoo! If your friend's nickname doesn't show up in the search results, the only way you can find her is if she sends you a link to her profile or one of her questions.You might try searching for them using the advance search option. This will allow you to enter their possible Yahoo! Answers nickname to see if they have posted anything.

The word up is an arbitrary word. In general people refer to anything in front of them or above their eye-line as "up".The sky. That's up wherever you are.there is no true up in general. for you up is when your standing and you look upwards that is up for you, for me in the northern hemisphere its the same when i stand and look up that is upwards.when the compass points north

you really cant... its hard they find a way to get throught....never give out ur main email address to any of the advertising websites...try yahoo spam filter works effectively for me or u can even try gmail!!!!!You don't.  At least not without setting up a very strong filter that can also delete good messages.  But if you find a way, let me know.Change your email address often.. . Alert people that your email is going to change.. . Never post your email address on the net.Never sign on to the internet again is the only way to keep them out.  Unfortunately it is inevitable because ISP's sell your email address, or spammers randomly try different combinations of characters to any @aol.com @comcast.com email address.
Scoot your face as close as possible to the computer- stop when your face is 'on it' . There you go!! (be more specific next time)all u need is a digital camera and a usb cord, take a pic. of ur self and connect it to the computer with usb and take the picture out and um...stuff, i dunno~Yes you do need a scanner. You scan the picture into the computer and save it into onto your computer and choose it as a screensaver.

It should say reply to this.you're welcome to contact me & I'll IM u backI tried to send email to you and see whether you could reply, but it didn't work. I got this message:. . "Oops.

attachment to big?Maybe it's about your connection. Did you open too much window browser that may affect the attachment of your file? Don't open too much application especially if you have a slow internet connection.
Yahoo signs out and it when your internet connection drops.  it does it automatically if upon sign in, you click the box that says Sign in automatically.Because you are probably losing connection and then you're connecting again..it has to do with your internet provider
Yes, wrong Category but i will answer ur question.. In humans, all the different hair colors are due to just two types of pigment (melanin) called eumelanins and pheomelanins (European spelling, phaeomelanin). Eumelanins are the dark brown and black pigments while pheomelanins are the red and blonde pigments. The different colors of hair in different people are due to a combination of these two different basic biochemical structures.why is this question in THIS category?
It's hacked. Too bad. Now the hacker can get all your personal information. If he hasn't changed the information, you can click the forgot the password link enter your information and they will give you a new password or send you the current password to a seconday address.contact the administrationWell try to contact them somehow.Am i helping.
When abuse is reported we can only hope that the proper officials are notified. they can change their email, but not who they are and the law knows that and I believe Yahoo does too!That seems highly dubious to me. Has it happened to you?These are people who don't care about much if anything in life. Asking sick questions and trying to get off on them is the highest their minds work. They are almost all old guys in thier 30s 40s and older. There are legions of them out there like this.. They also use emails they made up just for this purpose. Sneaking around is their way of life.. . I would like you to ask more questions and leave them mopen longer than 2 days so I can answer them. You are smart and thoughtful. Not many here like that.So? Most of it is spam anyway. And they can always make a new account.What do you mean, "lose" all their e-mail?  They might get spammed or worse, but "lose" their e-mail?  I don't know what you mean.I am not sure if they realize it or not. I figure when they signed up it took them all of 20 seconds and that means they didn't read the terms of service. I figure most people realize when they post something on here that they will get some freaks that have some off the wall remarks and I suspect they don't for the most part take them personally. I have noticed a lot of older women on here over 50 with some really bizarre questions that are not too appropriate but hey what are you gonna do. I always am happy to help an old lady across the street!!?. . i thought people were being open minded ...... . or i have not read the inappropriate questions?What do you mean by that?
   Adult content would be things considered inappropriate for children, like bloodshed and violence in a movie, a documentary about open heart surgery, autopsies, or life in a maximum security prison. Such images, while perhaps offensive by their graphic nature do not violate anyone's morals or sense of ethics but are subjects that a child would not understand, these topics would most likely be beyond their scope of comprehension but are not "dirty"..    Obscene or profane content on the other hand would be things like an Andrew Dice Clay performance, pornography, or anything else that a large percentage of people would find morally offensive. Unlike the examples cited in the first paragraph most people would admit that these are "dirty".or*l sex is adult content. . f*ck, sh*t, and d*ck is obscene and profane. . One is an entire theme.. The other is questionable language."Adult" is probably more along the lines of being purely sexual in nature, while "obscene/profane" could include scatological stuff as well as anything overtly sexual.can be one and the same, depends on the adult.I think obscene/profane content may be more of a reference to foul language, and adult content may target explicit sexual references.adult is dealing with s3x and profane is words like F---.Something with is obscene means it has no beneficial value whatsoever.I don't think sex is "dirty" unless you're on the beach or something.  I would consider sex and other related topics adult.  Obscene would be talking (writing) about adult content in a vulgar manner.  I think there is a difference.They both are dirty by the standards of society. Adult content means the same as sexual content. Obscene/profane content means vulgar language and/or gruesomely violent or disturbing scenes.cursing is obscene. sex and drugs are adultTo me adult is soft,romantic...but still porn (or alot of swearing,etc)Obscene to me would be the kinkier stuff.Semantics!!! My dear Watson!I would think "adult content" would be simply "mature" while "obscene" would be much more explicit.it's a silly pair of catagories.  adult content would include sex stuff, all of which could probably also be called obscene.  profane normally refers to swear words.  if they just took out the 'obscene' it would work.. . it also bugs me that the don't have a catagory for point-gaming since they've said it's not allowed.

Maybe they got tired of having to write the same software twice?  It's probably better for them to get everyone on Messenger because then they can track your activities better and get good information for their records.Java applets are generally slow, performance hogs, and not well supported now that microsoft doesn't include a JVM with the browser.Maybe they don't want the caffeine
they will only asked for your credit card number if you are vying for the premium service. If you are just signing him up with a free account, it should not asked you any cc informationNot sure where your signing up at but they never ask for one just to sign up for mail.

Yahoo mail get on overload sometimes.  Try it again.because Answers isnt a chat room,if you want to talk to people talk in IM or in a chat roommaybe because of huge volume of transactions using the internet access.i experience the same.
Right click the yahoo messenger, in the system tray, down at the bottom of the page, next to the clock, and it will say sign in, or exit.

If you are a member or moderator of the group, post or email the newsletter to the group.  Members who receive messages by email will get it by email.  The other members will read it at the group.So your the guy who sends all the spam. Stop it!! Stop it now!!!
At the bottom of your profile page, it says MY ANSWERS. In parentheses, it tells you how many you've answered so far.You "should" be able to go to your Q&A page to find that info.  However it has proved to be unreliable.
There could be many reasons. If you are on a network, make sure proxy settings are assigned properly. If the problem persists, provide more detail including error message displayed (if any) in a separate question.Are you using it at home or work? Sometimes, your work might have messenger disabled.
yahoo scans mail upon arrival and will not open if it is infected, just send it never never land,. i had this problem a while back and i tracked it back to earthlink and reported it to earthlink and in a short time it stopped. . good luckmark that msg. as a spamdon't ,delete it. if you open to return it will ruin your computer
Read the guidelines.  You should put something else in your question title.Offering points for an answer is considered "gaming for points" -- a violation of the guidelines.it is considered points gamingthey did that to me too...it said i was gaming points lmaono its just that it is considered incomprehensible.get over itMay be you violated the community rules & someone has objected about it.sey. don't know why but maybe they didn't consider it a real question not sureit's just absurd that's it.You must have violated the community guidelines.You caan't mention giving away points in the question. They consider it to be "point gaming" and will remove it.Then give me the 10 points.

I take a good look at the lot and its surrounding . Then I research the lots owner with the county tax collector or assesor. I contact them and hope to find negotiation. If you cant see what your buying dont do it.. hope this helps . I have done this in Las vegas, NV and Orange county FLLocal county govt.
Opel is part of General Motors here in the U.S.  You will find that many GM cars (Chevy Malibu, Cadillac Catera, and the upcoming Saturn Aura to name a few) are actually Opel designs marketed under GM brands here in the U.S. . . In the U.K., Opel models are distributed under the Vauxhall brand.It's probably because its not well known. I've never heard of that car make. Put it under Other-Car Makes.you could just put it under cars it doesnt have to be under a name

I get you... Solely based on who's got the most best answers in that category, but I see what you mean about the ratio of answers to best answers, some people have quite a good success rate, like 50 best answers out of 100. But it doesn't go off that. Maybe it should, Answers Team- you out there?If you're referring to the top answerers for each individual category, those are determined solely on the number of best answers that person has received in that category. It rewards both good answers and activity on Y!A.. . If you have ideas on how to change that, such as ranking by percentage, you can send them to the Y!A team by clicking on the "Tell us what you think" link at the bottom of the page or by posting in the Y!A forum. (The link is in the upper right corner of this page.). . As for the featured users (those they talk about on the blog), you can find a little more about how they select them here: http://answers.yahoo.com/question/?qid=1006020604923I'm new here. Some answers I answer quickly just for fun.  Others  I take my time and try to make a good answer. About 50/50 I would say :-). . Of course sometimes the fun answers can hit the mark!! . . . I' dont know what my % is yet. I haven't been on long enough.. and everything goes to vote urg!the person that asks the question picks whose the best answer. Maybe youre just not giving the question-asker what he or she wants out of asking that question. so then (s)he wouldn't vote your answer as the best.Well Lilith.  Thats the name of the game i guess.  I mean when I didnt have many I just kept answering questions thebest way I knew how ans boom !!  It works!!You Pick The Ones You Like The Best.When i ask i just pick the answer that answers my questions.Ive gotten best answer a few times that i maybe shouldnt have but oh well.If someones answering 3-4,000 questions they would have 6-8,000 points ,thats alot!Who has that kind of time?Just answer the true questions to the best of your knowledge and try not to worry about the points.

u have to tweak the settings in your browser under options or preferences, depends on what browser you are using.  Clear you cache & uncheck saving websearches...On the Yahoo! Toolbar? If so, click the pencil icon (it's just before the search box) and choose Clear Recent Searches.click the xhave you been viewing Porn? jk. anyway . IF YOU WANT TO DELETE SPECIFIC WEBSITES AND NOT ALL.... if your page has all the standard buttons showing at the top( IE: search, favorite e-mail,etc..) you can right click the history button (the clock looking thing right after the favorite button) and what ever website you want erased just right click them and delete them. .

put them in your spam list ... and you won't have to read themBlock or change your e-mail address. You'll have to let your friends know you made the change...it's just another way of doing it.I would start by asking them to STOP. Sometimes it is that simple.  If not use you e-mail software (MS Outlook, Eudora, etc) and you can block them.there's a spam button there somewhere
Well my husband would like a Wrestling category and I think Jane would love a Boxing one (I really did think there was one but there isn't) in sport . And Other...I really wish they would bring back 'Other' even if its 'miscellaneous' there needs to be a place to put Questions that just don't fit anywhere elseUse the forums to make the suggestion.. . I can always find the right category because everything I mess with usually deals with computers and cats.I don't think you can tell them anything. Or I should say you can tell them anything you want. BUT if it is vulgar they will just xxx it out. And If it isn't they won't and don't pay you no never mind anyway. I have been put in violation notice a few times. On one such occasion I sent the answer team a response that I wanted to like defend myself as I didn't and don't think I was in ANY KIND of violation. I got an automated response and have heard nothing since then. So I don't think they Read any of it unless it suits them. Kinda like an EGO thing.PUT BACK 'OTHER'. . You could search random stuff easily, instead of flying all ove the site for different topics. They claim it was the most 'offensive' topic, that's why they pulled it. Maybe they should take a look at Love/Romance, or as I like to fondly call it, 'Sex/Filth/Hookups'.I spent ages looking for psychology, then saw it hours later on an asked question, so had to click on that then ask my question. Don't know where it was though!. I want to be able to categorise everything in my Q&A, we can already separate best answers, but I want to be able to separate in voting, resolved and open questions too.I know that's not what you asked but hopefully the Answers team will look at this question!. The poll and surveys category was good, but they removed it 3 weeks ago cos they needed to do some work on it apparently, but quite what needed to be done to it I don't know cos it looked fine to me!. And they've taken "other" away too, I liked that category, now there's quite a few questions that don't seem to belong anywhere just being put in really obscure places, like the one I've just asked about why Americans don't like English people. I posted that in the "answers" category!

Just ask them?DID EVER THINK ABOUT ASKING A PERSON?ok George....if the persons nickname and NOT their ID is showing on your messenger list...hover your mouse over the name, a little box will appear with their Yahoo ID listed under the display name.

However NOT ALL profiles are listed as some people claim as it is up to each individual to select on their account/profile page whether their name appears in the Public DirectoryGo to the Yahoo Directory.  Good Luck!

Maybe you should try changing your I.D. and passwordThe best answer i can say is that... if u feel that you in box is being hacked just change your password [thinking that u are able to login]. Make an habit of changing pwd for every 3mths and other way to say that some one opened ur mail box is [simple logic] that if new mails are in read state which are not read by you thenyahoo automatically cleans your box after a certain length of time. unless you save it to a folder.I guess that answers your question, if you notice your messages are gone and  you didn't erase them, make sure your settings are where you had them. You might want to change your password often, to something you think no one would guess and DONT TELL IT TO NO ONE.Change your password. I don't know how to tell if someone has been in there but it seems that missing emails are a good sign. Change your password to something with numbers and letters and don't have your computer sign you in automatically or remember your password. That should help make it more secure. You can also reduce that risk by changing your password once every couple of months as well.. Hope everything works out for you.maybe you should take it off knowing youre name nd password automatically and see what happensI'd change my passwoed just to be on the safe side.Ok change your password and username know!!!!!!!!!!!!!CHANGE YOUR PASSWORD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!get a new password and keep changing it every now and thenIf the email in your box has been read and you were not the one to read it...chances are somebody read it for you...Change your password and don't give it to anyone againcheck every dayYou should change your passwords every one or two months.  Most of us don't make random number and letter passwords so it's only a matter of time before someone breaks them.  Also make sure that you go and change any other name and pw set that was similar or the same.. . There are thousands of identity thefts each year.  It could be  just a stranger on the net.  But it also could be your friend or a family member wondering what's going on in your world.  . . And be sure to turn off the option to keep your passwords saved on your comp if someone else uses it regularly. . . You could ask the e-mail account provider to tell you if there is an IP address other than your own that accessed your e-mail.  The help is highly unlikely if you are using a free account, but I hope you get it.  Good Luck.try to get new passwordTHEY CAnT IF YOU DONT GIVE THEM YOUR PASSWORD AND IF YOU FILL THAT SOME ONE OPEN YOUR ACCOUNT THEN CHANGE YOUR PASSWORDchange your password, I had that happens once come to find out it was my boyfriend that I HAD AT THE TIME>   I set the person up sent myself a love letter after being a jerk for a few days he admitted to doing it.I agree with changing your password. I also feel you should make sure you don't have any keyloggers on your system. A "friend" could have put one on there and would be able to capture your password change. I really doubt this is happening and it's most likely my paranoid side speaking, but it's good to run a virus scan on your system.Change your password and be done with it.you would have a bigger bill than usualNormally it will say "You have...new messages." If your number goes down someone may have checked them.Some one has been reading your mail. Get a New Secure Password, that You must use each time you open your Email'You won't know if someone else has entered your e-mail... Unless your 100% sure it is secure... and you protect your user name and password. . If someone wants your e-mail they can get it without you knowing it...  Just as a safety precaution you should never transmit sensitive information over the Internet... IE. Social Security Number, Bank Acct. #s, Credit card #s, etc.  this information, unless it is a 100% secure transaction.  the question is is there such a thing as 100% secure?iono if u never have new messagesthey might know your password, change it to a hard one , make it a mixtures of numbers and letters so they will never find out, also make sure to change the secret question's answer.If some of your messages are gone, you need to change your password. Go to where it says "my account" at the top of the page, and look for your password - change it to a combination of letters and numbers that you can remember. Maybe something you like to do - or something you remember.if ur messages r gone then i think u noe someone has been in ur emailpress ctrl+H on Ur web page

she knows the proper password as of now and u dont know the proper password. its simple.Did she log out on her computer? I've had that problem when I use to work in an office. I would log in there and forget to log out and I couldn't open it until I went to work the next day and logged off.Some times server connections can be slow when logging out and that tends to make u lagg so wait a bit and if not try to change ure password if you remember it and then log in.  And if that works reset ure password back to what it was if you wish to keep that old password.  Other wise contact yahoo directly you might have been hacked.  =)  Best of luck.

first of all in these examples cycle is not the word it is merely a part of a word.   lots of words are spelled the same but pronounced differently (ie. read and read) and lots of words are spelled differently but pronounced the same (ie. red and read)  its just how the english language worksm..a..g...i...cThats because of conversational dynamics, and social acceptance of pronouncement's of given words. Like tomato, ambulance, emergency, etc.I... don't want a pickle... I just want to ride on my motor....  :)OK, I don't really want to answer this but I have an idea of why ... I found that words in Japanese taken from Chinese had different pronunciations according to when they we borrowed. Like China had different dynasties, you know, as in Ming, Han, so on...  The pronunciations were fossilised in Japanese but had moved on in Chinese.  So your CYCLE as in BICYCLE  could have been an earlier pronunciation and Motorcycle what the world was saying say 400 years later -- not that I know.  Just a suggestion.  The science that this would interest is called etymology.Why is the OUGH pronounced differently in . enough. through. ScarboroughWow....good question! Kind of like, why do park in a driveway and drive on a parkway???

im not aware of that.. but ths 4d infoIt's not possible for an asker to delete their question once it's been resolved, but the Answers Team could have removed it if it didn't follow guidelines. Happened to one of my best answers a couple of weeks ago, but I'm not sure whether I lost the points or not.Dunno, some of mine have been removed as well. I lost 2 or 3 I think. What's worse is they left some rather iffy ones and deleted a couple answers that had good technical info in it that might be usefull to somebody. . . What I suspect happened is that something offensive popped up maybe in an another's answer or the question was ruled out of bounds and they zapped the whole thing. Considering the tripe they leave up I feel this is way to arbitrary and that some folks are being outspoken by hitting the abuse button to rid themselves of answers they cannot beat the logic of.The people who respond to you are able to delete their answer if they so choose - I guess one person decided to delete his or her answer to you.. . At the same time, should you answer someone, you, too, are able to delete your answer to someone else should you choose to do so.
you shouldn't be discussing "adulterated questions" on the internet period. it's just sick and wrong. go get a life jackassSEX ROCKS!Why is it necessary that everything has to have an adult section?and how would they tell how old you are.because they want to maintain a high profile and quality answers appropriate for all age groups.Because children need advise from adults.Because it would obviously attract 13 year old boys who like to look at things they aren't supposed to, and it would also be an excuse for them to make ridiculous questions that aren't at all serious.Well, let me ask you this in return. Today alone I have seen more than enough s**t that made my stomach curdle on this site, and some of it was under the "homework help" section. If  yahoo! answers gets an adult section, will it really keep the perverted freaks from doing what they will? No. They will still try to infiltrate the minds of those using the other sections. Would it really be a mature place to ask questions? No. There will still be children and teenagers who are curious about the "x" rated lives of adults who have access. So, would it be a practical, legitimate conquest to pursue? I'll leave that one up to everyone.WHY WOULD YAHOO! WANT THAT....THERE IS ENOUGH SMUT ON THIS ONE.I think it would be nice too. There are some things I would like to ask that I don't want to ask friends because I don't want them to be bashing my fiance or giving him funny looks. Besides I don't want them knowing all my businessThe adult questions usually get answered in the Yahoo Groups.  There you can have it moderated and keep the youth from taking over with the childish questions.  I have a couple Groups that do provide this service on specific topics.because some parents would rather be doing anything other than supervising their own kids,some people should have pets,not childrenI totally agree. There are many issues which adults benefit from being able to discuss frankly without having to worry about whether or not it's appropriate for children. Adults should be allowed to be adultsCoz most of the times it'll be visited by kids below 18 yrs or some perverted minds who'll start sexual abuse of kids etc....Also why is it necessary to have a adult section in yahoo answers?It is a good question, however many young people use yahoo and it can become a target area for people seek out people which later can be traced back to yahoo answers. Is is best to use the personals, of which there are many.This is open to the young and old, it can send a positive and a negative message to the young and old. There are some very rated "x" things on Yahoo answers sometimes. I have to shut my eyes to some of this fowl stuff myself! I think if Yahoo would monitor the information that is coming through that is very fowl it would be great. Delete anything that is too harmful for a child to read.Because some answers have too much sexual content in them and yahoo probably don't want to sensor every ones answers.I don't know but that is a really good question.great ideaThat would be a good idea, I'm all for it.An adult only area woud be riddled with hor*ney teenagers. Adults can get each others yahoo ID's and talk dirty if they want. No need to take it public.i agree it would be nice to have something like that..but have you noticed that some kids lie to yahoo about there birthday and have yahoo thinking they are really 18 and they could be 12 or 13. i guess thats why they dont have that. if yahoo did that then the younger ones that lies about there birdaytes will have access to it. so it really wouldent be any pointAdults ?Let them look at adult websitesI agree! It would be nice if we had one place to dump all the xxx questions, but even if we had one, I doubt ppl would use it. People posting those questions only do it to get attention and be idiots. Still it would be nice to have an adult-only area.Email Yahoo Answers team.

What you see is the Mail Preview!!... The chances of Viruses are high with Attachements and attachements never open automatically on preview. So you are safe... If you dont want next mail to open as soon as you drag one mail into trash, simply press "v" , reading pane will disappear... No reading pane --> no previewA virus can only be an attachment. Attachments are never opened on your computer unless you download them and on top of that Yahoo won't let you download anything it thinks is a virus.I think what you are referring to, is that mail opens in the preview window. Unless you double click the message, it is not open and should not affect you in any way. It's only in "preview". Do not click on any links, as they do work, even in preview window.
Then don't worry about the points. However, the more points you have, the higher the level you are, the more questions per day you can answer. That's my only motivation behind points.well it cant be helped..when you ask ,you automatcally get rewarded the said 2 points... and there is no way you can get rid of the points..Hopefully, u could get some type of reward, but in reality, you'll probably get a congradulatory email.  But good luck!I'd say horde them and let them accumulate. There are some undisclosed "Thank Yous" listed in the points chart. Perhaps when this thing goes out of Beta they will try the Google idea of paying some of the more renowned "experts" here :)923 points how come I dont have that much!
Can you not contact Yahoo! and see if they cannot give you a direct answer to your question. Only trying to help!I'm having the same problems. lately I sign on and it will appear that i am invisible on my friends list, but ppl will tell me im online.  also when i try to put an away message, it will appear occasionally.   I took of the old messanger and dl the update, but it still is happening...so now i don't know what's going on.I am having the same problem, with only a couple of my contacts not all of them.  I have tried writing customer service and sending comments - but with no results.  They can see me when I show available to all.  This is so frustrating, especially when I am at work and need to talk to some people but not all my contacts.same problem here, no answers that work as yet!need more info....what does it tell you when you go to stealth for that paticular personI had the same problem with just one of my friends, I always sign in invisible, but when I would try to change my stealth setting it didn't work, so I just installed yahoo messenger again, & it worked.Hi..You sign in as available...and set the display in stealth settings...on online:)..Or the other way around!. Greetings!
According to your profile, you are level 1, haven't answered any questions, and only asked this one. Are you sure you are logged in under the correct user name?Oh... it's not you... It's Y!A.... they are having some sort of problem this afternoon.... with their servers and software... . I too have the same problem here...I thought on Yahoo Answers you could only use one id name. Ive tried to use a different name too in the past and it wouldn't let me.It's a software issue. This Yahoo thing is only in Beta (Test) mode. Keep trying.Yahoo!Answers are having glitches today in the system. I answered someone question and Yahoo sent me an email stating I have a new answeryou probably answered over the answer limit
You can't.  You can delete answers, but once you ask a "stupid" question, it' there forever.   No, I'm not implying that you asked a stupid question, but we've all been there.You can delete a question and if you are real bad, they will do it for you, so ask away.. Check on the right to your question.  The Delete button is there.!You cannot delete questions, after it has been up for the time they allow and if no best answer is found, then yahoo answers deletes it. Other than that you can only delete answers you have given, but lost points when you do.Over on the top right side it say Delete question.
I'm guessing Yahoo! Answers just ran out of ideas. They should either increase the rates & votes for levels 6 & 7 or combine the 3 in the points system chart.They just recently became the same, but they were different before that, too, confused (?) .. join the crowd.  . . When I first joined Levels 5,6 & 7 had unlimited Rating and Voting per day.  The day that I hit Level 5 was when they capped Level 5's to 100 per day of each.  That was just coincidental timing, but I was chapped.. . Then, just recently, the team put the 100 per day votes/rates limit on Levels 6 & 7, too.  A little too much abuse of those, I'm sure.  Or, just wanting to re-focus people on Answering instead of Votes/Rates.. . So, now, we've got the three upper Levels with the same limits.  Maybe we'll see something different for the higher levels, eventually.  Like the right to vote on removal of really stupid answers .. or the right to vote on removal or quarantine of abusive or perverse questions or profiles.. . So, why are they the same?  They just kind of fell together that way with the changes.do the best you can for now. thank youi don't know. I'm at firstSo the super dorks can seperate themselves from the regular dorksyeah, but it's impossible to get there anyway so it doesn't really matter.I am baffled myself.  It just makes each level just a number.. . I suspect since the levels used to be different that they will change again.  Hopefully by the time Yahoo Answers comes out of Beta each level will be distinct.not exsactly . but i think there should be other priveliges for themThey are not. On level 6 and 7 you are the first too find out!It is.We can't always get what we want.We don't make the rules, we just play the game accoding to the rules  provided us.why did i not get a special thank you from yahoo when i got to level 3 this afternoon? who knows....
That's a little bit vague, so we can't help you.  However, if you revise your question and add more details (error message, steps to duplicate, etc.) maybe we can help.Can it becos is down?  or your p/w is wrong?that's been happening lately with my yahoo mail and some of my friends. it says that they might be experiencing technical difficulties...... i thought it was just me at first lolmaybe your id or p/w is wrong or that you got locked out of yahoo mail go to yahoo search and ask the question they will give you advise on how to fix the problem
All looks the same to me.  Perhaps you could be more specific?If you mean the email to and from the Yahoo Groups, it seems that Yahoo is having a BIG problem.  Messages that I approved on Wednesday have not been posted to the group as of today (Friday).
There is a very good book called "Search Engine optimisation for Dummies" (available on Amazon). It is a couple of hundred pages long, so I won't even attempt to summarise it for you. . I highly recommend it!Are you creating a web page? You can at least choose what searches you want by trying: <meta name="keywords" description="your keywords"> in your <title> section.  That way Yahoo or any other search engines will know what searches to put your web page in.
I am sorry about your handicaps.  I am fairly certain that the people who complain are referring to the kids who type in trendy shorthand:  str8, ne1, cos, etc.. . That doesn't bother me either, as long as I can understand what the person is trying to say it doesn't matter how well they were able to type it.I really don't see where proper spelling is any harder physically than spelling improperly. If you are able to physically type handy caped, it would not be any harder physically to spell handicapped, which is the proper spelling. Using your handicap and the fact that you have arthritis in your hands (so do I) is just an excuse. Having arthritis does not make it so that you can't spell. "diysabilites"? "rarly"? "stuped"? These are just a few of the spelling errors. Spelling these words the correct way would not have been any harder on you. . . Yahoo Answers has a rule about spelling errors.......... .        8. USE ENGLISH ONLY: Please do not use other languages or symbols. Be sure to check your spelling and grammar, as content that is unreadable due to excessive typos may also be deleted.. . I'm sorry if you are handicapped and I know the pain of arthritis, but neither of these ailments (with the exception of a learning disability) cause poor spelling or make it impossible for you to use commas and other forms of punctuation. . . Since you didn't mention what type of handicap you had, you can't fairly call me narrow minded, especially since I did state that a learning disability would be an excuse. If you only tell half the story, you can't expect people to know the parts you choose to omit. . . S.S.Do not disheartened. These busy world it is common to have typographical errors so it is better to have it checked spelling check up and for grammar etc there is a latest technique called grammar check up also . i trust that this clarifies your doubt.Do not develop a sort of complexity in asking doubts. Only a walking child falls not a sitting child Understand. be cheerfulPeople automatically assume you can spell correctly. Also the fact that there is also a 'check spelling' button for every question or reply that you use, make people think that you are too lazy to use that button.Most of the people on this site do not have a handicap and should be able to write clearly enough for others to understand what they have written.  There are too many questions and answers that do not appear to make sense to the reader.  An occasional spelling or grammar error is OK, but every word is absolutely unacceptable.  . . By the way, I did not take more than a minute to type this entire response and my spelling and grammar are understandable.
Virus issues.. . http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AsVVD7cdwq4cbfS.SFs3j4vzy6IX?qid=1006050603701Hmm, I hadn't noticed. It could be your internet connection. I know when my signal is weak, it takes forever to email and check mail.Probally because they want us to buy the upgraded version. Same reason why I am getting more spam.
Once a question is no longer 'Open' then you do not have the ability to delete the question. The intent of the site is to build a repository of searchable knowledge, so Yahoo does not allow users to delete questions out of the database once they are either 'in voting' or 'resolved'. Otherwise, users could delete questions that other users might want the answer for.You cant delete the questionsI think that you can't delete it, and why would you want to delete it anyway???????I asked this one once and unfortunately we can't.You can't get rid of resolved questions, they are permanent.click where it says hello and your name and it will be there it does work so i better get the best answer for this oneAfter they are resolved, you cant delete them.You can't only Yahoo can do this.You can't, to my knowledge. I wish Yahoo would put a remove feature on there so we could.
On the top of the screen click on your level and you should see everything you need too know!Save them up and trade them in for a new car.see if we can get to level 7 and be the number 1 spot and beat that jane furrows chick.nothingWell I have decided, nothing they let it go as a game but the win never wins I think it is fun just to tell my opinion on things! I do wish people would choose a "best answer" cause it lets you sorta see who a person is their personality anyway!You go to hell if you don't get to level 7 by the time you die.nohting i dont guess I have 549...lolbe proud of urself,especially if u dont do anything else in ur life but hung around here.i find a guy that actually has 1500 best answers.imagine that!I don't really know, but right now I'm competing with my fiance to earn more points than him bc we both have no life. I just try to answer as many questions and get chosen as best answer.

First put your hand on the mouse and move it about, you should see a little pointer moving about.  When you have got the hang of this try and place the pointer over one of the buttons on the tool bar and hold it there for a few seconds a little box should pop up and tell you that buttons function.  If it is a function that you wnat performed then you press the right mouse button and take it from there.IT SHOULD TELL U WUT EACH THING DOES.It's horrible for your antivirus....just remove it.. . It's not worth the trouble you will experience downt the road...

THE SUN IS HOT?!  I thought it was orange because that's where we get our orange juice from...dang!was wondering about thinking about wodering wondering thinking wonder thiink wondering thinking wondering about about about about thinking wondering!And your question has what to do with Yahoo products????
Some just have them shoved up so far......it would take a hell of a lot more than "just a pull" to get them out!!!Nope I cant, I mean these cops would find it in my pocket surely!!!lmaoNo way man, I love this stick and it's staying right where it is. mmmmmm poo stick...Sometimes it is not as easy as just pulling. One should consider first how the sticks got there in the first place and then work backwards on the issue.maybe they enjoy the anal sensation lolbecause they dont know howwat u mean by sticks exactlyi've never had anything up my butt. glad your feeling better thobecause that would be way too convenient and had most tried their hand would get lost looking for it since most are shoved in there pretty well.Okay hang on..... WOW you are right! I do feel better!!! Of course now I have to waste 5 points to figure out how to get bark outta my butt.I guess some people just like the feel of the stick up their butt.Because some of them are shoved up so far, theyd have to pay to have it removed by a professional.do u mean why can't people stop being "stuck up"??????? if so idk it's just nature and they need to get over themselves. they ren't perfect.i don't think they know they have something up their buttsDoh! I wondered why I could not get comfortable...lolWho shoved the sticks in, and for what reason?Maybe they can't reach because they are too fat.Definitely, sticks aren't very comfortable things to have up your butt.Opinions are like ^&%&holes - everybody has one ... there are just more of both on "answers".. . Removal of stick is a start ... now we need to get all the feet out of mouths and the brains in gear.. . Peace outThats kinda an anal question

Keep asking questions without answering any, I suppose. Or, just don't get started on "Answers."Someone just goes to the site and does not do anything. They are reconized as in level 0you kill yourself.
get a new account.  when you are forced to give your email to sign up or view something, if you know they will spam you (like it isn't a forum or something), always give the old email address.  i do and i get 0 junk mail.Get Spam!If it's spam, in the mail it should have an unsubscribe link.  If you are talking about actual mail that comes to your house everyday, I don't think you can stop that.  Just stop buying stuff out of catalogs so they don't send your address around.delete itIf all the mail going to your bulk or junk mail folder is spam, then you could try setting the spamgaurd to delete email upon receipt. To do this you go the the "options" link in the top right hand corner of your yahoo email account, click on spamgaurd, and choose the option to delete upon receipt. If you open the email and click on the unsubscribe button this will allow the companies to know that your account is active and they will send more spam. Best not to use that link.
Go to the link below to see all information about points and levels in Yahoo! Answers.This point system is so retarded..you don't get anything, not matter how many points you get.
Make sure the highlight blog box is ticked, press preview - then post. That should work.you may not be saving it.
Thank you sooo much for Teletubbies and all the other second rate English crap that gets broadcast over here. Sorry dude, MR Bean just isn't funny.. . Damn we gotta put up with your bad teeth and take verbal abuse as well. Want to see a Englishman and Frenchman outrun a tiger, you just simply put a German right behind em.. . I used to love listenin to that English Superiority complex when my buddy from England would sit around and put us Americans down way back in high school. Then I'd kick his butt and make him admit that any Nation that bows down to a queen is inferior and that would be the end of it. At least he had the sack to insult me to my face thoughThere are far too many of them. About 300 million in the USA, plus millions everywhere. I guess they reproduce like rats.Yea, the content is same but, the portals are different.Cause we're in the minority.  But in taxes there is a UK section.Because more Americans are on this site. Tell your friends to sign up and you'll see more of your people on there.I'm from England (born there, dad is from there), but I live in Ireland if that is any comfort to you.Sorry, are you actually asking a question or is this a very thinly veiled rant?Arba. . bite me, if it wasn't for England you wouldn't even be here today fool.I think it's just because there's so damn many of us and we all have nothing better to do than sit around on our bums playing with Yahoo answers.  I don't think there's a separate Yahoo Answers for Brits or Americans.Americans are more deeply entrenched in the rat race to own the most things than people in most other countries.  Therefore, a higher number of their large population has access to computers and the internet, therefore we hear a lot more American blah blah blah than we do from other countries.It could be that there are more Americans and the U.S is a much bigger country. . What have the English done for the world?
PUT AN AD IN THE PAPERFirst look for a good BOSSPut a flier/posters around the area where such people live and leave your mobile number. After one week start making personal calls and make a rate chart of your activities and the corresponding rates you can charge
Use the ignore...you won't receive his messages anymore. Change your yahoo name and only give it to those you really want to talk to...Don't list your name on your profile then he can't look it up and find you again. And in the meantime, don't respond to any messages he does leave you.Put him on your Ignore list.Maybe you could also change your name.report him or monitor his attempts to contact and then inform him that what he's doing is considered stalkinguse another service.  yahoo is great but not great enough to endure stalking....If he keeps iming you then you must be responding to his im's. The simple solution, put him on your ignore list. Go to your preferences, click "ignore list" and put his ID in there. Or the next time he im's you just click the ignore symbol in the im. One click is all it takes to stop being bothered by someone.Use another service.. . How can he find you by your name if you dont list it in your profile?Put him on your ignore list and then report him for harrassment to yahoo.i think you should talk to him about it and tell him that it really bothers you and u would really like for him to leave u alone .... or make a new screen name and use a fake name so he wont find you anymore... and if it gets to the point of really bothering you report it
good question.  I hope you are n't talking about me...I assume you're talking about a Yahoo account.  . . I guess they are not complete idiots since they can figure out how to open a new account.As far as i know they don't have a basic intelligence test for joining Yahoo, and therefore it has free access for all plus there is no account limit.Yahoo doesn't distinguish between which idiots they allow on here.don't know!
1.go to www.mail.yahoo.com. 2.press "sigh-up". 3.fill up the registration . 4.provide yahoo Id that you want to create (new). 5.follow other instruction on that registration page. . Thus, you can have a different Id account to sign inyou need to sign-out of first and then you have to click "sign in as a different user". put other user id and password to sign inyou need to signout of first and then you have to click "sign in as a different user". put other user id and password to sign in
don't no is somthin wrong wit ur puterummmm...im not quite sure what ur talking about but...u should probably go back and add more detail to this question...rephrase that...Yeah, there seems to be a problem with Yahoo Groups right now. As group owner I approve messages for my group, but none of the messages get posted or sent out even after approval. I also don't receive notifications of new members joining the group even though I should be receiving these notices.
most famous people smoke because of stress and all of the pop. and then they have other issues to dill with of other people or fam.0 - because if you smoke your not famous in my opiniontired of living and 2 . ;) whats the number for ?
When you invite someone to join you, they have to approve it. Thus, the add request pending.  I don't know if you can erase it or not.you've tried to add some one to your buddy list,and they haven't accepted or denied it yet.. The only way to erase it is to delete the name.It means eaxactly what it says ... the add request is pending.. . In other words you tried to add a buddy. That buddy has to approve the request, e.g add request pending.u should convince that buddy to add u and it will get erased automatically. or if that fello is not willing to add u just go to the address book and delete his or her add list. i mean msg list. bye and have a nice day.. would u like to add me to ur msg list. i am male and from pondy. just msg me if u want to know more. my id is <goan3remo>. byeif im not mistaken you can just right-click on the contact who you are trying to add, and then cancel the request. that is the only way it will go away. unless the other person you are trying to add accept your request. fyi "add request pending" means that yahoo messenger is basically waiting for your request to add a friend to be accepted by the other person. also, you may never know that this person has declined your request. if the person wants to they can send a response saying why they didn't want to accept your request. but its all up to them. i hope i was helpful.
The government email probably has a firewall that is blocking the incoming email. Check with the LAN administrator to see if you are allowed to send/forward from the email service you are using.It may depend on your goverment managed servers. Whether they use standard POP3 and SMTP ports or if they are firewalled. Also they may be useing Secure protocols. Talk to the network administrator to work out something that would work for both of you.The government site might be blocking the connections to its mail servers from Yahoo.Allot of times Government Firewalls will Block the automated forwarding process of emails.
The ton of avatar questions, are all about what the users think of their avatars, there is quite few technical question about Y!avatars since it is easy to use.. I am not sure if Y!A team will take this suggestion into consideration since they stated that questions like (what do you think of my avatar?) is considered a violation of the guidelines. so if the users are going to have a category where they will post such question, there won't be any benefit of the new category.That's a great suggestion.  . . It is a different 'product' at http://avatars.yahoo.com. It does get a TON of questions here.. . Makes complete sense to me.  How about posting it on one of the 'enhancement suggestion' threads in the forum!?A "forum" would be a good idea, meaning something in "Yahoo! Groups". A lot of these question are like "Does my Avatar look good?", which sounds legitimate until you think about the fact the Yahoo wouldn't intentionally make your Avatar look rotten. So, it's just a matter of taste, and therefore chatting. Yahoo! Answers is supposed to be for questions and answers that have more universal meaning than asking chatty questions like that.hullo temporary chaos...yeh..tonight, i read. over 40 questions-"mostly chatty questions" mentioning avatars..yeh, they should have a seperate forum exclusively for avatar lovin' folks...meow!They should hey? They have a lot of bragging questions about their avatars like 'how is my avatar looking' or 'why do people like to have avatars?'People in public DO look more like avatars nowadays. ChatChatChatChatChat.Questions asking if you "like my avatar" are "chatting." If they have a serious qusetion they can just put it in a Yahoo! category. My pic is still the best ever.

Please follow this path. Tools> internet options> content> auto complete> clear forms. To stop the generation of history in the yahoo search bar, uncheck the box of forms. It will solve ur problem.Beside the 'Y!' icon there's a pencil with an arrow beside it. click the arrow and you'll see a list, then click on 'clear recent searches'.. . That's for firefox by the way, in internet explorer it's the same except instead of 'clear recent searches' it says 'clear search history'.
www - world wide webLately i've been a little "bizarre"...............  (I think it came from reading a few "bizarre" UK questions). .  Of course i'm kiddingwhy are we bizarre?? i thought there was just one Yahoo answer for the entire world, not seperated by county.I'm not sure, but I'm getting your bizarre U.K./Ireland question right back!. . Maybe it's cuz everyone in the U.S. loves an accent.its international. The logo slapped on the top is done depending on which Yahoo you logged on to. Its all done using a little scriptIt's international - the web!It is funny, huh?. Why do they bother making separate sites to log into if it all ends up in the same place anyway.. . Late at night on the west coast in the USA the site is flooded with Q&As from India.  I always thought they were logging onto the US site, but maybe not...

A new module for your 360 page is in the works which will display a badge for Yahoo! Answers. The Yahoo! Answers and 360 teams have been working on this for some time now so hopefully it'll be available soon, but there's no telling when exactly it will be.The badge will not work, but the RSS feeds willThe first answer is your answer..... Although I have to wonder...WHY the badge is not working on 360, since a lot of answerers here have their own 360 page and have this problem-not being able to upload the badge onto their pages.... One of those things that don't work when they should.

It stinks when you think that a good question came to mind and when you search it, someone asked the same exact word for word question two months ago. Sometimes your still tempted to ask again, or tweak it some. But yes, the scenario you described has happened to me.I think my mind is in a different library than most other people. Check out my questions if you don't believe me. They're really strange. Actually I'm pretty sure you have come across my questions before...some people are just are curios about the same things we are. the other person that asked it has some things in common with you.?
I'm glad to hear I am not the only one to which this happens. I am sorry that I do not currently have an answer.Gee, you just don't get it do you? People really are avatars. I'm not stupid, I knew that when I saw a teller at the bank and she had the ghost face. You have to pay more attention.I kind you not I saw a guy at the gym that looks like a fricken avater. He looked that way even before I knew what a avatar looked like.I don't know what to tell you. Maybe you're used to seeing the avatars in this forum, that you're not used to seeing people? And maybe you wish, you knew us, but arn't sure how we'd appear, if you did. those are my guesses.Because you can post your own pictures, too.you can change your picture on your yahoo!answers account to either 'avatar' your own picture, or no picture.i think people are stupid if they put your real pictures because people can find them that way.
They make carrying things, easier.It's a case (a holding device) for briefs (legal documents).  Otherwise, you don't need them.so men can have a purse but it can be cool instead of a girly looking thing..Its a way of carrying the things you need for any meeting, lectures, conference,ext. and keeping them organized at the same time. I think you do need them.It is used to carry documents everywhere.Some people use it to carry one suit when they go outside the station for just one day.It is always useless for heavy luggage.I believe he's talking about the one in windows. It's for you to put files and such in so you can move it all at one time  your desktop or laptop. To move files back and forth easier.the purpose of a briefcase is to make the person carrying it look smart but he is really not. He is like you and this question.They help you carry a lot of stuff around.

I'm sorry that you were so hurt before. Do yourself and your boyfriend a favor go visit a therapist for a few sessions to work through your doubts. Good luck.ASK HIM ARE  YOU PLAYING ME AGAIN.Just tell him, I've been played and I don't want to be again, so if you playing me tell me now. If he isn't fine if he is DUMP HIM!see what he does instead of listen to what he says, does he really do anything for you, IS he worried if you are sick....does he introvuce you proudly to his friends or family..... . I don't think people normally have the intention to play soemone, unless he hates you....sometimes they are just irresponsible kids wanting to have some fun, when they are bored, they leave you... so try to keep things saucy for both of you, trust is important, the last thing you want to do is acting insecure.he's propably dating another girl behind your back
Dammit..did they change the alphabet AGAIN..I just finished learning the old one....grrrrrrr. . :-)I'm sorry. The problem is that no one else is experiencing this so it's difficult to answer. If the text got larger, try clicking on the View menu and then on Text Size.What letters exactly to you mean? How is anyone supposed to know what you are talking about?. . . Learn to communicate so that someone who has no idea what you are referring to will understand what you are saying.  This question does not do that.. . You might know what you mean but no one else does.explain what letters.They changed the letters beacause:. . The previuos letters a, f, j, n and w were not sounding that good together.. . Morover, they need nore vowels to make good sentences.. . Also, f, j and w are quite uncommon and cnt be used that effectively.. . Also, the kids dint know what rhyme it was.. . Even the scheme was unknown.WHY DID HE STEAL THE LETTER?. . THE MAN BRIBES INFLUNCES HAS A DIRTY & CORRUPT THOUGHTS IN MIND HE WANTS TO HARM OR KILL SOME ONE OR HAS STOLEN EVERYTHING FOR SOMEONE WITH WHOM HE SHARES BED THEREFORE DOESNT WANT THE PERSON TO REACH THE RIGHT SOURCE THEREFORE HE STEALS?on what?. .

Please go in to detail to get a good answer.The letters are the same!be more specific letters to what your question needs detail and you'll get better resultswhich letters?. what are you talking?
You have A point. I do it because it's better then watching Tv all day. And hopefully I have helped someone and I learn alot as well. So that's my take on it.Beware the evil points!very. thanx for the points
he he move to the usa?. well maybe if you sign onto yahoo usa and then register for an address. it is on the homepage i think, where you can get on different yahoo's, like yahoo uk and stuff....i think that might work.when you sign up for a email address use USA and a 5 digit zip.There is no official email service for the United States, so all you can do is fill in that you live somewhere in the USA when regestering for one of the many free email services availible on the internet. However, be advised that doing so is against almost all of the end user agreements you must accept in order to joiin those services. Also, you are not restricted from entering other localizations of yahoo based on the country you register as being a part of.
You don't need someone's email address to get your password back. If the usual signing in procedure doesn't work, go through the 'forgot password prompt' and fill in all the necessary information. If any of that information has been changed (unbeknownst to you) then you won't be able to get into the account. This will necessitate an email to Yahoo, but be forwarned..these days Yahoo is extremely slow or doesn't reply at all. Should this happen, all I can suggest to you is to open a new account and keep your password secure with only information known to you. NEVER share your password with anyone, and NEVER share your personal information.All you have to do is simply click on where it says forgot password and type in another e-mail address of yours.(It can be any screen name)thanks!

Because Yahoo! was started by 2 geeks who love to change things.  Yes, the new design is pure crap and nowhere near as nice and user-friendly as the original, but sooner or later they'll change this too for change's sake.i kinda like the new site...lightin' up
I don't know Cuz I think we might have the same problem with im cuz mine aint working at all. Each time I click on it it just says sign in when I have already signed in. And it never lets me in.go to toolbars and add your desired icons
If you're using Yahoo! Mail, there's no way to know when or if someone opens your message. If you use Microsoft Outlook, you can request that information when you send the message.Use outlook express.  You can use the tools to notify you when the e-mail is opened.  You'll receive an e-mail with the date and time.not possible (unless you put spy wear on computer or in some instances if you use the same service and the service offers the option but most do not. (I think AOL does, or at least used to)
report the emails as spam. and that will delate them and you wont get them backi would suggest getting a new account. or get multiple accounts. one for friends, another for business, another for miscellaneous. you wont get any spam if you dont give away your email to spammers. there isnt much that can be done to prevent junk from getting into your mailbox. i once used someone elses email to sign up for spammers as a prank
If no one vote the question will have a tie, and you will be a tiebreaker till someone votes, then the question will appear showing how many days left for the voting period..

Yahoo Answers smokes too much.  It keeps going outside and talking on its cell phone.they lost their MOJO.<ding>First, lol @ gardenana. Touche, my dear.. . And because you're probably not as heavily trafficked as Yahoo is on an hourly basis.Yeah, I wondered that myself.. Do you think they are serving Iced Java or Frappe Capuccino? LOLHopefully to change their Featured Question.  I'm tired of seeing that homeschooling question already.someone brought some bad potato salad to the yahoo! memorial day picnic and everyone is suffering.Never heard of this.What do you mean?They are always here when i am here....sorry i'm on a break lol. ot's experiencing technical difficulties today dont worryBecause they don't want to submit,choose best answer,and other things all the time and I believe sometimes it is how you do stuff on here.Ya, I know. Everyone thinks that it is great for us, but then, it just stops working. I mean, I get on, and the computer is taking a break. I mean, what is their problem? they are just like, taking a break everytime I try to do anything. I mean. Everyone thinks that it is great for us because we have computers, but then they like, don;t work. I mean c'mon.I would have answered you sooner, but YAHOO was on break!lol, I was so thinking this, what kind of website takes a coffe break... I am so addicted to this.. that I was pissedDidn't you read the note they leave.... it's a coffee break.  Yeah, sure. That's what they want you to believe.sorry but they're out saving the world from man eating huge @$$ breaktaking spiderscan robots get tired no they need time to continue thier plan to take over the world beware ive seem the matrixThey are having bandwidth issues.  They crashed earlier today and this is probably a stop gap measure to slow people down and prevent another crash.? but it keeps getting on my nerves!their tired of looking at lame a## ques tins that's why.your question gave me three breaks ..... ask the networkI think Yahoo answers is getting too busy with users and their servers are spitting out the coffee break message when the servers can't handle the load of people logged in.Idk why but it sure is sad.Coz they're tired...?they are human beingsy does a server need coffeIt's not their fault!  One of the new temps made the coffee for the Y!A office this morning and it was all decafe.  . . Not good, they've been nodding off all day.  Poor things.I don't know mine goes on breaks like every 5 minutes

Bouncing occurs when a group message or Yahoo! message is returned as undeliverable.  It is best to delete them from your members list so you maintain an active email list of members.If group messages sent to your email address are returned to Yahoo! Groups as undeliverable ("bouncing"), your Yahoo! Groups account may be temporarily disabled.
I agree. I removed some people from my list and they IMed me and thought they were still on it! I say ask.you wont see their icon anymoreOnly way to know certainly is ask. Because if they remove you´re not allowed to see if they are on/off line anymore.It's not true that you won't see their icon on your list, if THEY removed YOU. The icon, and names disappear from YOUR list when YOU remove someone. But if they remove you, the only way to know for certain is to ask that person. Sorry. Probably not what you wanted to do.
maybe u type wrong ID,. wrong spelling,. wrong password,. check also the connection ^_^YOU probably forgot your password...if you have a lan line go to control panel, then click on internet options, click the connections tab, click where you see lan settings, go to the poxy server box click use proxy server, and leve the boxes blank, just make sure the box that says bypass proxy server... is clicked, the click ok, and then ok again, then try to sign in.....ths is what fixed mine....if it dont work change it back

Supposedly Brad cheated with AJ, & now JA is supposedly with Vince Vaughn, she was too good for Brad anyway.  Go Team Aniston!
You could compress the file using ZIP compression first, upload it to Yahoo! Briefcase (which has a bigger filesize limit than Y! Mail), and then send the associated link to your friend in Y! Mail.question is, what program you want to attached and check the file size first, Yahoo mail can upload maximum of 5 MB per upload at a time.In the new e-mail, click the 'Attach Files' button.  On the next screen, click Browse and you'll get a Windows 'choose file' box.  Just go to the right drive or folder, find the file you want to attach and click Open.  When the file is listed in the 'File 1' box, click the 'Attach Files' button at the bottom.  This will return you to the e-mail, with the file attached. Then just address it and send it.zip it and attach to the email.. . If still problem, rename the extension .zip to .txt. When someone receive it, rename it back to .zip and enjoy program.. . Good luck.When you are in Yahoo! email and are composing a message, you have to click on the "attach files" button found right below the subject line. You find the file or document and click on it. Then you click the "OK" button and you should see the name of your document above the "attach files" button.

Answer lots of questions, this will get you 2 points per question.. . I think it's better to put a bit of thought into your answer though, as you are more likely to be voted as best answer and gain 10 points, if you click on my name, you should come up with my page, I've got some open questions you can answer if you want to. I only give the 10 points to the most interesting/funny or most appropriate answer.Points Table Action Points . You Should read this first:. . Begin participating on Yahoo! Answers One time: 100 . Ask a question  -5 . Choose a best answer for your question 3 . No Best Answer was selected by voters on your question Points Returned: 5 . Answer a question 2 . Deleting an answer -2 . Log in to Yahoo! Answers Once daily: 1 . Vote for a best answer 1 . Rate a best answer 1 . Have your answer selected as the best answer 10 . Receive a "thumbs-up" rating on a best answer that you wrote (up to 50 thumbs-up are counted) 1 per "thumbs-up" . . An easy way: If you ask a question -5 Points. If you answer + 2 Points.. Suppose you ask 3 questions 3x5=15 You lost -15 points not good. Then you should answer at least 8 questions then you will get 8x2=+16 points. One point a head. Always keep + points.. . Now if you really answer a question in a best way then you will get not only two points but if some one will chose you will get 10 points (Read above table) means total +12 points.. . In short, Answer many questions ask few. If answer try to answer in a best possible way. And one more thing just getting one point easily vote you will get one point.. . You can see my points and learn that will also help you.. . If still need help send me mail: nihon94@yahoo.comalso when someone doesnt decide on a best answer and it goes to a vote, vote for your own!answer alot of questions and ask alot of questions. quite simplejust answer tons of questions, vote for best answer, etc.answer LOTS of questions!Well, you can answer dumbly by saying "huh?" you still get points for it.give good answersDO GET ON THE SITE A LOT.answer and vote.
Actually I think there is a technical hith in the answers program. I suspect when 2 people answer at the same time theres a copy made, and I suspexct that if I answer, and then use the back button and hit submit again theres another copy... would you like to tell yahoo? I just put up with it.i wish i knew. can't understand the "wisdom" of it either
because its furry and you stroke it i assume. eww.Why is penis called cock or dick or one eyed monster he he he he no one knows!!!Well, I never heard of it being referred to as a "pusy".If you ask a question like that, then you're too young to know. In other words, ask your mommie and daddie and see if they'll give you a answer.a guy had to come up with that one too.lol u don't have notin to do.Nobody knows.Pussy as a slang term for the female pudenda is thought to derive ultimately from Low German puse "vulva" or Old Norse puss "pocket, pouch".  It didn't arise in English with a sexual meaning until the 19th century, but prior to that it had been used to refer to women in general (16th century).  It has since also come to mean "effeminate, feeble, or homosexual men or boys" (20th century).
Well this is Yahoo.  You can't expect very much really.Yahoo Answers is still in it's beta stage with all the maintenance and their updates  expect a lot of glitches.You're probably a boring loser who could make a corpse roll over and play dead!!!Yahoo is wigging out again. It happened to me the other night. Just keep trying. And don't be surprised if you get a bunch of emails telling you someone has answered your question and it is the answer you gave to someone elses question. Its been happening to me all night. It will go away. I promise.don't knowperhaps you have reached your limit.Im having the same problem. Click back and forward a few times, it fixes the problem.i keep getting the same message.it takes me at least three times to get my answer to go thru.Same here but I kept on trying, and it worked. You should do the same.Yahoo must be having problems......I am having the same trouble.Two answers come to mind:. . 1)  There is a lot of traffic, and the nodes are getting crowded.. . 2)  There may be bad weather in the area, and static electricity is affecting the signal.If you keep trying, it will eventually let you post.Keep trying, it's doing the same thing to me.....Maybe you've been banned.. . I'm having the same problem.. . edit: I guess it's fixed. Go figure.I'm not sure why that happens but I think if a lot of people click on the same link at the same time that message shows. Just click back and click the question again. It should work in a couple of tries.Well there is a limit to answering questions.. You can only answer so many a day.Everybody is having the same problem.The same thing is happening to me. It seems random. Sometimes it's before I type my answer, sometimes after, sometimes I can't even get into the question.who knows....keep tryingThis has been happening all night.  They must have a glitch or doing some work on the system.. Keep trying.IT is actually nice to know I am not the only one in this predicament.
You can only make comments after a best answer is chosen. See the help page below for a full answer:HUHYou can only put a comment in when you choose a best answer or a best answer is already chosen.A comment is when someone picked a best answer then another user clicks on add a comment, then adds a comment on the best answer.when you hit the word comment, a box will pop up when you can write down what you wish. it is just like answering a question except this teature only shows up after a question has been resolved or when it is about to be resolved (voting)you can't comment while the question is in voting, only after it is resolved.where it says answer this question in blue right under the question
I just created a new one i havnt been able to find a way yet i sure there is to delete a acountFollow the link in my sources to delete your account.. To make a new account, just click SIGN UP! on the main page.If you are talking about keep the same email box then there is no way to delete the original email address. but you can create another email address in the same box. Click on options in your email account then click on Mail Addresses. Down at the bottom, you should see Extra Email Address. Click on the create button and you will be able to send and receive from both addresses. If you want another email account all together. I would suggest saving your address book on your computer. Open a new email account. Upload your address book. If you want to keep any of the email, you will have to forward them, one by one, to the new account. Once you have done all of that then you can go to the link below and delete the original account:
Open two windows in Internet Explorer.you can't sorry. it wil almost be like a theft on yahoo or spam.I use two browsers to do that. Open one account in internet explorer and other in firefox or netscape.. You cannot open two account in one type of browsers as they use cookie so once you log in one account the other account will be logged out.

I totally agree with you. Although some users are just plain rude, I think other users have just become jaded from all the FAQ's and have gotten on the defense when answering questions. I've had a few users become pissed at me by posting a link to their FAQ. Hopefully, everyone on here will learn to treat others kindly or they won't get many best answers with an attitude problem!The ones that get me are the ones who answer an obviously humorous question, posted in JOKES, with some really serious answers. As if you really ARE obsessed with your bellybutton!I have asked lots of questions and lots of people do that to me.Some are just being mean usually it's the people that ask the sick or perverted questions that answer questions this way..next time you see it go into there link and look up some of the questions they have asked.Some people don't know how to browse resolved questions to find the answers to something that's already been asked, or they think it's more boring just to read the answers to somebody else's question than to get answers to their own. To answer your first question, I think it's probably because people like to feel smart, and the easiest way of doing that (bar actually LEARNING something and BEING smart) is to act smarter than those around you; thus, they will belittle others. I can't condemn it, exactly, as I believe I have done it myself. We all have, unwittingly or otherwise, at one time or another.It's not about not knowing, it's about not listening or looking at the evidence; making statements only by what you've heard, not by what you've figured out. For example, calling Bush the Antichrist because alot of other people are saying that is ignorant. Having are reason would not be ignorant. But people just say things like it's the only answer there is and aren't willing to even look at what you're going to show them. THAT'S IGNORANT!!!! And I HATE it.kinda being a hipocrite, arent you? i understand that you think that that question doesnt make sense, but maybe someone else has a good reason for asking it. i mean, i understand there are those people out there that are just askin to ask, but you cant say that "everyone" treats "everyone" else like that and pretend that you care, when you go out and do the same thing.I dont know why.. Some people on here are just losers.remember that text is read by the reader as they interpret it, sometimes answers may seem blunt, but to the writer they may have been written as they speak. . It happens to me with work emails all the time, I now try to take all emotions out.they just answer the question just to got the points of it!! i posted a question, the da vinci code site one, and i got the most rude answers ever!!Let's see:. . Only one spelling mistake. Question makes sense. Question is actually worth effort.. . You are currently not ignorant.. . If people don't make sense, or spell like the rear end of a dog, or ask something stupid, THEN I will nail them. . Otherwise, I will answer it to the best of my knowledge. (Pretty much everyone I know do this and I expect the same from them regarding my questions.) . . I once asked something stupid, just to see what reaction I would get. Unfortunately, almost everybody answered it openly and honestly. . Oh, well. Some you lose and some you don't win.I have gotten rude 'answers' too - there are some very mean people in this worldI answer inane, nonsensical, ill spelt, illogical stupid questions for a variety of reasons.. For example, there is a spell check available, however some questioner's are either too lazy to use it, or prefer to use their own form a grammar.. Another questionable question are those which can be answered by using just a simple bit of research.  For example, Who was Sigmund Freud?  Hey dummy, his birthday was last week.  Look it up.  What is the exchange rate between, US and Australia?  Look it up.  That's what the computer is for!  It has a wealth of knowledge!  Stop being lazy and look it up!I noticed what you are saying. I see this when I answer the Asker's question. Some very disrespectful people out there in the world. . . Majority of those Askers, really do not know and want some answers to help. So the best way to get answers also ask questions right? . . Also, too I believe that many people have to realize, there are variety of ages on Q & A. So some of them are quite young, and not as experience as an adult may be.they're not their....for a start!!!!
what?Clear your cookies. Tools / internet options / delete cookies
I select them by whether or not I have opinion on the subject and if I do, do I have enough knowledge about the question to back up my opinion.  It would be ridiculous for me to try to voice and opinion on something I totally knew nothing about.  That's my opinion!  (Smiles)  Good question!Um, you just did
it is a request from someone who wishes to add you to their yahoo messanger. it is best to answer it either by denying to add them to their list or let them add you to their listI'm haveing the same problem but asked in a different section. If I find/recieve a solution, I'll share it with you, because this is such an anoying pop up.I am having the same issue. Every time I sign in, all my friends that I have added, the add requests keep popping up.... every single time. It is VERY annoying... I hope someone can help out...Hello everybody, me too, suffering from the same problem. Even I have deleted the contact and have asked my buddy to delete me from his yahoo, still problem not solved. I wish somebody can help us.Two more people here having the same problem.  Obviously Yahoo has a big hiccup on its hands and hasn't come up with a solution yet.  What a bummer.
When a letter is open, there will be a box that says "forward."  Click that, and you will see the letter on a new screen where you can also write what you want to the person you're forwarding to.  :)Do you mean autoforwarding, to another account?. . You have to pay Yahoo for that - it's called Mail Plus, and it's $19.99/year.  Check there web pages on it.  You get other benefits too.When you enter whatever you wanna forward in this box it says FORWARD and you click it.as far as i know there must be a button called "forward" on that page
Tools-Internet options-General tab. Type in the address for the home page you want . Click OKGo under Tools --> Internet Options --> then under Homepage, type anothere address as your starting page.or you can assign some other page as your home page...
You can't. They all come that way. Just don't click on it.What difference does it make ,it's too expensive to use, just don't use it.
No they will Not.. They Maybe Sending u Messages but u will never receive themYou will always appear offline to them.IF they are on your ignore list, they will not see if you are online
nobody's entire avatar shows up. just the face. see, mine does too.They only show the face of your avatar.ur avatar only appears full while chatting. Otherwise, it's just the face.
Yeah I agree.  Sometimes it's better to make the top part more of a topic, so that the people have to read what's below in order to actually answer.because it is more fun that wayUnfortunately, you are learning something that many of the older generation has realized...people do NOT read!  They just don't bother to take the time so they miss a lot of important information.. . In other cases, some people are in such a hurry to have the first answer that they just skip all the additional information provided.  I have never found that, the position my answer is in, prevents it from being chosen as a best answer.  If it is best, it will get noticed even if it is the 8th answer.. . Experiment when you post your questions until you find a method that works for you.  You are right...not everyone reads the entire question.Please don't do that! I think it is far more annoying when people ask "Can someone answer this question?" Anyone who doesn't read the whole question is most likely not worth listening to anyway. I feel your pain but don't sink to that level :)because people type real long ones and people dont want to read all of that so they just answer you're questionIt's much more fun when they don't, look at some of my questions and you'll see what I mean.. . http://answers.yahoo.com/my/profile;_ylt=AgMen06IWRMhhVaBctWp71gezKIX?show=AA11517146
What browswer are you using to surf the internet?  If you are using Internet Explorer, you could be opening yourself to viruses and spyware.  I recommend looking into Mozilla Firefox, it's very easy to switch.a possible explanation is that too many spywares are now installed on your system through the many websites that you have visitedVirus or Spyware

And as the pitch of your distressed reaches its peek, forcefully expell this air through your nose, adding another distressed noise. "Chuuuuuu" will surfice. This noise you only need to maintain for as long as it takes you to expell all the air.

tools. options. privacyGo to Firefox Tools -> Options -> Privacy.. Check yes to save forms, remember passwords, allow sites to set cookies.. . Goto your Yahoo signin page, and click "remember my id on this computer".. . That should do it.you need to activate in the options settingd and ther you can find activate the password rem option. this wil work out
Most programs should have some way of setting this type of privacy issue. Depending on the application you are talking about, check the settings. If there is a way, there should be in the program settings.If your talking about your name on Yahoo, go to the RED Y!on your browser and click on EVERYTHING YAHOO.

Right click on the folder that you want to delete.  Then click on delete.do what kristy said there is an add - edit near folders at topwhere it says folders at the top it should say "Add - Edit". . Click on Edit & from there U can manage your folders.  In order to delete a folder it has to be empty.You look above where it says inbox and stuff, I believe, and it should say edit files, or something on that order...then you will see that you can delete your unwanted folders.
Quit being such a loseract like you own it act like you got it and eventually they will want it no book nerds . dress to impress get a bftalk to people and help them.talk to ppl and try sonner or later like to make  friendsadd me into you yahoo messenger and you will have one new friend !!Join clubs, and get involved. If you are a genuinely nice person it should not be hard. Volunteering your time to a cause you care about is another way to come into contact with genuine people. Don't be shy, people will only get to know you if you are willing to put yourself out there.What kinds of friends do you want? Act the way of what u want ur friends to act like!!If u want goth friends then be goth...if u want preppy friends...be a prep...if u want athletic friends....be athletic...ect. Do u c the point?do like me and my friend did camp out and just start talking to random people when the other people that are samping with you fall asleep they thought i was crazy at first though because i jumped in the water at 1:30 in the morningit depends on what kind of friends you want. loyal ones are hard to find. but if you be your self and try try again then eventually you will secede trust me i did the same thing.
I was thinking, what about an option where you can just click yes or no, and maybe it's only worth 1 point instead of 2.  Then Yahoo could refuse to accept one-word answers, which would help a little.  Of course people would still find ways around it (they always do...) but might help a bit.noIgnore those desperate idiots. . . It is really not practical. people will just change that phrase slightly and still type it.Probably, but unfortunately that would be very hard to prevent.  people always find ways around the system and enacting something that would prevent those answers would just put undue strain on the servers of Yahoo. That being the case, we must just call on people to quite being point mongers and try to actually help people by answering their questions to the best of their ability.  Which, by the way, you do get more points for having the best answer, and I guarantee that the Yes/No or Thanks for the 2 points answers are not going to get chosen for best answer.y? u need to give more reason to y u think it should be elimiated i dont have i problem with the way things are going nowI think it seems to be alright how it is at the moment, so my answer would have to be a no for it.No! It keeps it interesting.. . And thankx for the 2 points.now do do u suppose we are going to answer if we cant use yes/nothose type of answers are a violation of the guidelines and fall  under 'gaming for points' if it annoys you you have the option to report any answers like this.
when you ask a question it's -5.  When you pick a best answer you get 3 backthey want you to start answering question.. so the more question you answer the more pts you get. the more pt you get the more repect you get.All questions asked are -5 because it costs 5 points to ask a qeustion.When we ask a question, yahoo deducts five points. This is a rule of yahoo answers. Click on ur points to know more about point system on yahoo answers.it is the Yahoo Answer rule: if you want to ask questions you have to pay 5points,but if you choose the best answer you will receive 3 points, so in the end it will cost you only 2 points.it takes 5 points from you when you ask a question. answer is two points best answer is 10 points so onAll question are -5 points. The less you ask the less points are deducted.
asking questions only gives twerps and creeps a chance to be rude. But answering questions gives a chance to help people, even the ones asking stupid questions that make you wonder how they can even operate a 'puter.Asking an original Question [what a lot of 'homework' ?!] is often challenging, and even tiring.. But providing an Answer to someone else's Question is always most interesting - and, at times, good fun as well!. But, I like BOTH - as they give me a lot of food for thought.answering is more fun in my opinion =)to answer intersting questionsto ask questions. that way u get to see the opinions of other people.to answer STUPID questions wif STUPID answers. I just luv itI would rather prefer to answer the questions than seeking an answer to my question because I believe in myself.Question the answers.answer questions. . alot of people put up interesting questions. and i have a brain full of answers
If the person you are trying to IM is always "offline", and never returns any of your IM, then you are more than likely being ignored.  I was being ignored by someone- everything I just described- so I just deleted him from my buddy list.When the person "never signs on anymore".when they never answer you would be a good signYou can't know for sure, unless you have another screenname, then you could sign onto that and see if they are online.  If they are on on your other buddy list but not on your original one, then they've blocked you.When everything falls apart.i think it is when you never see them come online anymore.. i think that means they have blocked you from seeing when they come online.. means they do not want to talk to you anymore.. who cares we are all different and people do not understand all of our different ways...i know people do not understand me cause i have had to much damage in  my life and if they do not walk in your shoes how would we know why they do things, or if they like us or not....when you can't im them or email them anymore.
right click on your internet browser icon and got to properties. there will be a button there to "clear History"well this depends where u r typin this in..if its in the address box then u have to delete it by goin to the tools at the top of the window and internet options...if its in google or yahoo.. u have to do something but i forget cuz i had that problem too..i will try to figure out for you...
We update the Leader Board on Mondays. Since you started the week with 1,414 points you were 30 points below the 5000 position on the board. Check back next week to see where you are.They only updated it once a week, so check next week, or maybe you don't have enough points.maybe ur level or score wasn't sufficient enough...That is a great question! If you find out, please let me know too! Thanks!They post the positions on Mondays. So check for what your score was on Sunday night. You won't be listed at today's point level.I can never see myself either..hummmYou're not there yet.are you sure because..........um I for gotu should check it on monday.
they are stupid lazy crazy idiots !  Same people that go into the 10 or less lane with 30+ items at the store !They are not lazy their CRAZY.It is against the community guidelines so report them.sometimes they don't bother picking the category for their questions, especially if they're in a hurry, like me. sorry if that bugs youPossibly due to the fact that they are too lazy to look for the right category to place their question...so they place it on the first category they click on.Maybe the light bulb suddenly, inexplicably goes off in their heads, and they just gotta ask, right then and there - where ever there is!. . Hey I just thought of a question about tomatoes!!!
No, the counter refreshes itself.  None of the ones you didn't use carry over.They don't carry over!no, every day you start over.Every day is a new day, so you better use them upNo..only limited questions each day..whether you answer all or not, they won't be carried to the next day!Nope, each day its resets.
Same problem herebecause your computer has a virus (DUH!!!!!!!!)its not always you , yahoo can be real retarted sometimesor someone has your user information. or you have messenger installed on another machine that logs you in automatically.. . good luck.To the 'DUH' gal up there.... I have no viruses on my PC and I'm having the same problems this morning.  At first I thought it was my connection, but after careful research of our lines here I believe that Yahoo is having some problems this morning that have absolutely nothing to do with the individual user.It's yahoo, they are having the problems. Have you downloaded the new messenger recently? I did on Tuesday and have been having problems ever since. I deleted the new one and did a systems restore to the day before downloading the new messenger and it seems to have fixed the problem for me.why   does   yahoo   keep shutting  down   everytime it's  a   real  pain
first off, he better check his Ignore list to see if you are on it, if so, he better take you off. There could also be a chance your son has you blocked on his stealth settings.I had this problem before.  It was my net security/firewall.  The settings had certain things blocked from yahoo.
It is no problem to create a new account, all you have to do is probably alter your name (last & first, that is, when you're entering your information) a bit!. For example, instead of putting your first name for your first name as you did in your current account, put your middle name as your first in this new account...You can go ahead and create that new account....your current account wont be deleted..
click the boooring "happy" face and i think it gives u options i dunno reallymake a 360 page and put pictures that you want to useGo into your email account and look for Avatars. Follow the directions and you're good to go.
the icon you describe seems like an "attachment", you should be able to save by clicking on it or right click-> "save as". . Check that your email service has images not loaded feature on, for eg gmail does not load images by default, it has to be turned on.. . send your email as word or pdf document with the embedded graphics so that anyone can view them.If you look at your keyboard, along the function keys, left side, you'll see some icons that will allow you to raise and lower the light level (as well as sound, etc).. Try that first.Like the person above said check your e-mail  properties from the service you have.. Yahoo has an 'options' tab where you can change  your preferences.. Also it could be the file format of the pictures themselves.  If they are in some other file format (such as .Giff or .Tiff) that may also affect the embedding process from the sender and you may have to download them first in  order to see them....Have your sender send you pictures in jpeg or bmp file format.
404 Not Found . It could be that the page you are searching for has been deleted, or its name has been changed or modified on the server. You can try deleting portions of the URL, starting at the end, and see what comes up.maybe ur frequency r low...If it happened after you clicked at the word Mail, try again and see whether the address changed to http://mail.yahoo.com/. . . If not, you can open the mail page by copying http://mail.yahoo.com/ to the Address bar and click.. . This happened to me at asia.yahoo.com.. . If it's not for this reason - sorryYou're not alone.  Seems to be happening to many people, including me.Its not working for several people, but most say to keep checking back it will start working again!  Good Luck!
Common solution to this is use your own address in the To: field, i.e. send the email to yourself and Bcc: everyone else.Simply leave the To box blank. If your email client doesn't allow this, the best way to do this is to put your own email address in the "to" field.

Are you asking if a service can be in Beta? Of course. Yahoo! has many services in Beta right now. There's no rule or law that stipulates that only products can be beta-tested.This is a new service (about 5 months old), and they've put it out here for us to help them work out the kinks by reporting problems and making suggestions for improvement. There are some things you just can't learn from small-scale, in-house, product testing.. . Also, by testing the product in the real world, they can get a good indication of how much interest exists for this type of service. It would be a huge waste of time and resources to spend months and months on in-house development and testing for a product no one wants.
Search and download Magic Messenger also called Magic Login, click the crack button. After that you can open up more than one messenger using different id's.I dont think so, i've already tried : )You having two ID's, or two other people?.

You can't block someone on Yahoo! Answers. The best thing to do is REPORT HIM! If everyone reports abuse on sickos, hopefully they will become PERMANENTLY SUSPENDED and we won't have to deal with them anymore.Report them.Me too.. What needs to be done is to simply report them.. . But,. They always come back with a different ID.. . So, . I think the best way to get rid of them is to NOT answer their sick questions.... . Sadly, . Someone always answers their questions; therefore they will always come back.. Just report them; there is no need to play their stupid games...  It only gives them more attention (which is what they want) and they’ll post more questions.. . My advice to other people who is tired of them;. Is too report them and leave no answers.It is not possible, only Yahoo can do it.It might be wrong with this moralistic society, but it's free speech. See the First Amendment to the Constitution Of The United States.I wish we COULD block them, but we can't.  Only Yahoo! Answers or the FBI can get them off here.  The one who goes by xxXJokerXxx is not the same person as male26_Virginia...and the one who calls himself kentucky_derby_g (that last letter was a "h" last night!) IS the same, kentucky and male26 are one and the same.  . . Anyway, best thing to do is NOT answer his questions/statements.  And I do mean DON'T ANSWER!  He feeds off those responses....probably thrills him to end!. . Best thing to do is hit the "report abuse" link beneath his name in the question box, and tell Yahoo! Answers exactly how you feel.  Last night, I reported EVERY ONE of kentucky_derby_h's questions...me and a few hundred others...they were all deleted by Yahoo! Answers within 2 hours.  Just keep reporting it, they'll remove them, but he'll be back, they always are...under a different name, ID, etc., etc., etc.!!i agree with you.  some people on here are disgusting and their language is veru vulgar. I say hit report and let yahoo know what is going on.report them
Hopefully, you'll get your question answered and maybe learn something.  Plus you'll make someone else happy (the answerer) because they were able to help you out.If u r need u have to ask a qs. But tell y did wasted ur 5 points now?thats interesting to ask .but do u realise you HAVE lost 5 points for this question.well its more important to learn somethin new everyday than to be involved in stupid trivial stats like pointsBecause you might actually have a problem and would like a suggestion.  Or you might just be bored enough (like you) and want to see if someone will answer it and you'll feel like someone is talking to you.yeah i liked wat dellajoy2000 said =D
It's not the tonsils, I had mine removed as a kid, and I still snore.  I think the uvula might be the right answer since I have heard that removing the uvula stops the snoring.Snoring is the act of breathing through the open mouth in such a way as to cause a vibration of the uvula and soft palate, thus giving rise to a sound which may vary from a soft noise to a loud unpleasant sound. This most commonly occurs during sleep, or immediately after death.. . The cause of snoring is some kind of blockage in the breathing passage. Those blockages can be of many kinds—here are just a few:. . Tongue falling into the throat . Allergies . Throat weakness causing the throat to close during sleep . Mispositioned jaw, often caused by tension in muscles . Fat gathering in, and around, the throat . When the airflow in the breathing passage becomes irregular due to a blockage the soft palate may start flapping. This flapping of the soft palate is what makes the snoring sound.. . Numerical statistics on snoring are often contradictory, but at least 30% of the adult population and perhaps as many as 50% of people in some demographics snore. [1] [2]. . Most of the time snoring is not a health risk to the snorer, but snoring resulting from a significant obstruction of the breathing passage can be an indication of the potentially life-threatening disorder sleep apnea.. . Even if snoring may not be detrimental to the snorer, it can cause the snorer's bedmate to lose sleep. Being sleepy all day long can lead in some cases to life-threatening problems for the person and those around them. Also, studies have shown that there is a psychological component in snoring which causes discomfort in any listener, depending on the loudness, tone, frequency, and other auditorial attributes of the snore. Studies have shown that there is a direct inverse relationship between snoring and frequency of sexual activity between married partners, meaning that there is generally less sexual activity if one of the partners is a heavy snorer.. . Snoring is usually an involuntary act, but may also be produced voluntarily.. . According to Dr. William C Dement, of the Stanford Sleep Center, anyone who snores and has daytime drowsiness should be evaluated for sleep disorders.. . The loudest snore on record was 93 decibels.. . . . . [edit]. Cures. Snoring cures almost all revolve around clearing the blockage in the breathing passage. This is the reason snorers are advised to lose weight (to stop fat from pressing on the throat), to stop smoking (smoking weakens and clogs the throat), and to sleep on their side (to prevent the tongue from blocking the throat). But for many snorers those pieces of advice are not enough.. . Surgery is one option to cure snoring (for example a uvulopalatopharyngoplasty); dental appliances such as a mandibular advancement splint are another. There are many devices such as nose clips to keep the nose open and jaw mechanics to keep the jaw in the right position. Different aids work for different people.. . There is also a less known, but very effective way to stop snoring. It is to exercise the throat, the tongue, and the jaw muscles so the breathing passage will widen and stay open when you sleep.Snoring is the act of breathing through the open mouth in such a way as to cause a vibration of the uvula and soft palate, thus giving rise to a sound which may vary from a soft noise to a loud unpleasant sound. This most commonly occurs during sleep, or immediately after death.. . http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snoring. http://search.yahoo.com/search?p=Source+of+snoring&fr=FP-tab-web-t&toggle=1&cop=&ei=UTF-8i think its build up in your nose because you try to breath out of it and when your sinuses are clogged you make a noise known as snoringits your sinuses
Type your emails in word and then cut and paste the document into your email. You get on the spot spell checking as well. You can ether save as you go, save when you finish.

For example, the last few weeks most of the buttons in the mail (reply, move,etc) won't work. Can't figure out why and yahoo help can't give me anything that works. So I have just been dealing with it because I like their set-up the best. I also have had long emails not send so I started saving them first eslewhere before I send them.One simple thing you can do to avoid that:. . Open the Microsoft Word program, or notepad program, either one. Frequently copy and paste the email you are writing (especially when it's a long and important mail) into the MS Word. Just to make sure if the mail's screwed up again, you still have your latest piece of email which is pasted into MS Word. Then just log into your mail again, copy the mail back from MS Word to Yahoo mail and continue with your job :)I think I know why your computer got screwed up. YOur internet cable lost connection.
Yahoo is testing some new home page designs so you probably were in a test group for a period of time and then the test ended.  What did you think?

mayb bcuz they like ur real name better than ur yahoo id, or cuz theyre messed upI have the same problem. My default ID is my real name, too. If you want to use one of your aliases, you have to go in and choose the one you want for that session.that what you selectedbecuz they can and doesgo to your profiles and change the default from your list of id's.Go to your messenger tab in the main Messenger window...select "my contact details" from there you can change the way your name appears by entering your yahoo id or any other name in the "nickname' space then click 'apply'.  That will then be the name that appears on your Messenger and that of your friends lists. :)do you have it set to your real name or Yahoo id?For me, my dad and my friends are appearing with their real name.  My dad got called his yahoo id no underscore and capitollization.  I used to be called by my id but then i got my nickname posted and i only appear as blabbermouth to myself.  My dad sees me appear as poetryreader_21 or alysawang.
I'm sorry Tiffany I don't understand your question. Are you saying that the only time you can get on IM is if you are in Yahoo?You have to sign into messenger seperately. Go to your Messenger Privacy Preferences.  UNcheck the box that says "allow yahoo websites to show when i am online"....this will block yahoo from showing you as online when NOT signed into messenger on other people's messenger lists. I hope this helps a little as you question was a little unclear.
yeah. they should put some kind of child lock on emails. Parental Supervision kind of type.why shouldn't they? a 7 or 8 yr old can have an email its just that the parents oversee them which websites they are visiting or what kind of email groups they have joined or who are they chatting with.. . ideally they should buy & install a software whic h keeps the kids from visiting adult websites...They have them to communicate with other individuals, same as grown ups!. . Some schools provide an email address for their students, it's the way things are going these days!so they can tell grandma and grandpa they love them...because God forbid they actually write a letter anymore or be at house when gram and gramps call.  What has happened to the family unit!  *sigh*us kids know how to use pcs and sometimes we dont live near our friends and family so we use pcs  and email them and that is how we chat i check mine everyday witch is good and we dont go crazy to much im 10 thats why i dont go crazyTrue.probarbly to chat.to get pen friends.to get subscribtion of various newsletterand to involve him with the affairs of the world

If it has the red circlew slash through it then left click. Go up to allow scripts for Yahoo and left click again. This should allow the page to reload. For Explorer go to the menu and locate the internet options under Tools check that you security levels are set to allow the yahoo page to come up.
Within your email program, click on the View button at the top then click on Text size.  You can change it there.press control and use the wheel on your mouse to adjust.Use Firefox and install the 'Mouse Gesture' extention. Then do the gesture that makes text smaller (bottom right to top left). Works for me anyway.
why do people who barely speak english manage to croak out a sex question?  All this technology at your fingertips, and they want to know how to masterbate.  Like they don't already.Because its funnythe worst is the ones that cant string a sentence together>>> correct there english and bag the pointsI think some people on here have been sectioned and are posting on here from mental institutions!!
It probably derives from the preferred fighter tactic of positioning one's aircraft behind the enemy aircraft. From this position, a pilot could fire his guns on the enemy without having to lead the target, and the enemy aircraft could not effectively fire back. When two fighter aircraft circle each other trying to achieve this position, it resembles two dogs chasing each other's tails.Who knows? Not me~It is a 'dogged' and furious combat.. . Not all such confrontations are dog fights - just one of many termsDuring World War I, soldiers on the ground who witnessed combats among aircraft noticed it was very similar to dogs fighting, that is one trying to attack the other's tail. And somehow the name stuck.. . There have been relatively few dogfights in recent wars (Desert Storm, Balkans...), as beyond visual range (BVR) missiles are now quite good. So now most air victories are achieved without actually seeing the enemy (apart from on your radar scope).A dogfight or dog fight is a common term used to describe close-range aerial combat between military aircraft. The term originated during World War I, and probably derives from the preferred fighter tactic of positioning one's aircraft behind the enemy aircraft. From this position, a pilot could fire his guns on the enemy without having to lead the target, and the enemy aircraft could not effectively fire back. When two fighter aircraft circle each other trying to achieve this position, it resembles two dogs chasing each other's tails.. . http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog_fightThe early definition of the word 'dogfight' meant an aerial battle between two or more aircraft. As the First World War broke out not long after the aeroplane had been invented, there had not been time to develop guns which could be built into the body of a plane. The first fighter planes were only equipped with machine-guns which were fixed onto the top wing.. . These early fighter aircraft had two two seats, with a man sitting in the rear controlling the guns. Dogfights were extremely difficult because the pilot would have to dodge other enemy aircraft while listening to the commands of the gunner as to where to fly to get the enemy into his sights.
tiny at this time.. . in a few centries it might be 1/2...It will never happen in your life time.IT WOULD PROBABLY TAKE A VERY LONG TIME!!! BUT I KNOW IT'S NAME"VULCAN"!!!just dream abt it

You've probably heard about people taking advantage of minors before and how it isn't really safe to provide information about yourself on the internet.. . Yahoo! 360 is still in beta-testing and doesn't have the restrictions set up that would be necessary to keep younger users safe. It's possible that later on after they've developed it, that a version will be made available for a younger age group.They dont want to spend all day every day, keep the pervs off the minors .That sucks!  It could be because people post some pretty graphic pictures on there!  I'm 29 and I was even shocked!!Presumably, because you can post adult information there or because they don't think it is appropriate for people under 18. I can't understand the reason either.I'd rather Yahoo answers also have a section for those over 18. Us old people prefer talking to other old people.i guess its because the stuff that some people post on there i dunno but i think its not fair at all
You can! In your Messenger List, right-click on a person's name and select Stealth Settings. You can choose to appear online or invisible to that person.Highlight that person's name and click you appear online to this contact.  Select appear offline or appear permenantly offline.
you may not be Pakistani but as most of em will say "all look alike to them", its just a racial slur, they don't like the fact that a lot of Indian and Pakistani ppl came over to England years ago and because they worked harder and studied harder then most English ppl they became more successful and it was a source for jealousy and bigotry...try not to let it get to you mate, they're just ignorant gob-shites that don't know their @rse from their elbowlol. im a bengali and iv even bin called a paki. i think they need to be put on a anti discrimination trainingbest bet? you call them germans/italians directly.. . They can't identify - middlleeastern, pakistani, indiams, sri lankans - look alike to them.. . Paki is between Hinduism / Muslims. Calling you Paki and seeing your reaction - will immediately tell them whether you are HINDU or MUSLIM. . . If you are muslim they will want to be aware of you.For the same reason that we bombed Iraq when they had nothing to do with Terrorism. . it's like if someone from Denmark insults them they decide to bomb TexasLaugh and tell them your a lanki, lol. Seriously, they are just ignorant. It's the same as calling a Canadian and American (or vice versa).have you ever tried to say pakistany while your drunk?Fundamental law of the universe: Most white people from developed Western nations are ignorant of the world around them.  The US and UK especially go to great lengths to keep their people sheltered.
You can't.  All you can do is delete the information you have on it and set it to private.Good question.  I'm sorry but I don't know.  Try posting a comment at one of the blogs that I have listed below.  They read all the comments so check back periodically.. . Or join the 360 Yahoo group.  I see they have your question posted there, but you first have to join it.You cannot delete your yahoo360, once you have created it, it is there for good. What you can do is go into your yahoo360 settings page, uncheck the activate my yahoo360 link, set all the boxes on each page to private, and on the yahoo identity display me as, click the first circle. save every page that you mark each box, private, and make sure you click save on the settings page after you do what i mentioned above, and your yahoo360 page will no longer show up and your regular yahoo profile should be back.you cant delete your account...but you can empty it. You can delete everything in it..even your nick.....and leave just an  empty page..
I suggest first you learn to spell Yahoo!. When you've mastered that, try looking for a job at: http://careers.yahoo.com/look at their web site, also check out hot jobs. I have seen jobs listed there.
Are you David Copperfield?. :-). Abbra Cadabra...*poof*...The question has disappeared!I don't know, must have been deleted but no one could do it but only you:-)....umm...if ur question had no best answer, it was deleted.  if it didn't follow community guidlines or whatever, it could have been deleted too.
open ur mail box. click on the email. copy/download the photo.. cheersyou jus dend it and it goes through nam saying..download the attachment or right click to save
http://www.oldversion.com/program.php?n=yahoo  If you have a yahoo ID, you can just use the same ID (which you used to login here) to sign in to messenger once you download it.I'm not sure why you want it without the voice feature.  You don't have to ever use that.  All it means is that it has the capability for you to hook up a microphone and earpiece and use it as a telephone.  The only way this happens, though, is if one party invites, and the other accepts, to use this feature.
I read somewhere on here once that the reports are not actually checked by hand because there are too many abuse reports. I assume there is a system that checks automatically when the abuse is reported. And people report abuse for some of the most asinine things...I think it's some machine type thingumy wotsit doodah.i dont know sorry.. i'm new on this so i don't know.its a automated checkup by the protocol SERVER . Not manualI think it's automatic. Not sure if it is immediate or if you have to have a few reports before you get deleted. Maybe over a certain amount of reports gets you modified by humans just to check. Not sure though.Y_answers_matt (my personal favorite sincve he has the same name as me), kate, and amy get the abuse reports.  Then they leap into action and check the report out.  Also, a copy, not revealing your name, is sent to the person via e-mail to warn them before the mods destroy them.. . At least thats what I recall...
RELAX!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! . . People come on here for some entertaintment !  A lot of the questions asked are pointless but if you notice these are the ones that are answered quickest as they require no brain function :-) . . I wouldn't let it worry me.. so DONT LET IT WORRY YOU ! :-). All the BestWhat did Joe ever do to you?  Why did you have to pick Joe as your example. How do you think it makes all those Joe's out there feel?  This question is totally a ridiculous satire to ridiculous questions!I think most of them are kids, and have the mental capacity and attention span of a dead chipmunk. Don't get me wrong, some of them are adults too. What is the world coming to. -_-You forget that people are idiots, whether their name is Joe or not. Just look at the questions that are being asked. "Wll u chat wit me?????!" "Whut teh bester wey to gett grlzz??!?"I do not think that too many people think that this is a serious site.. If they ask a "silly" question, they're probably looking for a silly answer, or just to get people going on an issue.. That's all!. Some are actually here to get a sincere answer...try sticking to those questions and maybe you will not feel so upset.yeah you are right type of people use yahoo! answers some people abuse itBecause they are bored and just having fun.I agree with you completely. Joe IS stupid. I think you are a free thinker and probably very intelligent. And I bet you ,for a second , thought about giving me 10 points.Yes?dunno. just think it.
Have you tried a public search? On yahoo's main page do a people search.ask cenk?
Your computer dosen't seem to have optimum requirements for Y! Messenger 7.5 to work. I'd suggest you continue with V 7.0 or upgrade your computer.Also, keep in mind that sometimes there is a glitch in the communication between programs when Yahoo is running.  There are programs out there that use the same files that yahoo uses, and that could cause your problems.  For instance Windows Blinds is a program that doesn't always work well with Messenger.  Also, check out your processes and see what else you have running.  To do this click on control, alt delete to bring up your task manager.  This will let you see what is running and how much your using. . . Also stop those programs that you dont need.This service Runs with several Servers Like Voice ,Cam etc. and it have also Advance Services comparison to older version. It may be There are another Resion Like Virus attack Check Your PC it may be possible there are Some Virus Attack on yr Pc.
dont use them.they will be removed by yahoo.Restart a new one GROW UP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Go to Control Panel and click on "add remove programs" , then select the messenger you want to delete and remove it. All the files will be deleted.
click "toolbar setting" (pencil icon). click "clear recent searches". goodluck ^_^ON YAHOO TOOLBAR YOU WILL FIND TOOLBAR SETTING, SHOWING A PICTURE OF PENCIL. DROP DOWN THE MENU AND CLICK "CLEAR RECENT SEARCHES". YOUR PROBLEM IS OVER.open IE,click Tool>internet option>clear history, then delete cookies, then delete files.. . Good luck.. . D.N.H
you're going to have to clarify that a bit. what smiley faces?  what program/site?because you are sad. cheer up luv.
You can't. Your mail account will expire in a few months. So no worries.You cannot delete an email account. But if you don't want to use it, then just don't use it for about 4-5 months. It will probably say " Your account has been deactivated" or something like that. If that doesn't work, I guess you might want to contact Yahoo.
You probably did not use the account for over three months.  You have to sign in every few months to keep it active unless you pay for your email service.  Usually they reactivate it for you unless a couple of years pass.  If that happens, I advise you to apply again and hope your ID is still available.......you better create new account. If you want to active then u need to call the customer support number which is in USA. If you call that number it will take hell lot of time.
Yeah, I don't think it's fair, there are way worse questions out there than that! I just had a question deleted too, I don't know why yet, and it was asking for a food recipe!! What is up?!?well, lately answers team has tightenend their restrictions. violations are more rampant. to get users to play by the rules..for the rules used to be relaxed too muchYou should probably avoid the internet when your drunk....They sound like a lot of the cool trivial questions on here - what's a good book? What was your worst date? kind of thing. They are fun to read, and, of course, we get to learn about a good book, movie, product, place to go. Sorry you had a problemThe words "drunk" and "freaks" may appear to the Yahoo Word filter as "abusive". You sound like a "fun" d.r.u.n.k. I like to watch p.o.r.n. backwards so I can watch the woman give the money back. But that's just me ~I can't see anything wrong but if you go to 'Violations' it explains what they are. I got one for using a foreign phrase in the answer which was the correct response and it came back as 'using a foreign language ; unintelligible.' I've seen some pretty rubbishy answers that seem to get passed so I emailed then asking for a retraction and explanation when I had answered exactly what the questioner wanted. make sue that you reply too and set out your objections strongly. Don't forget that someone has to report you, probably a sad person, who has nothing better to do.i don't know, that's stupid, i've seen tons worse questions out thereIt's a fine line but a question like "what is 2 + 2?" is soliciting a direct response of which there can only be a finite number of answers.  A question such as your own, and invariably many others on Yahoo answers solicits speculation.  Not a bad thing, I hear you say and I would heartily agree.  So Yahoo needs to clarify for us and in the event that they cannot they should maybe chill out a bit.If you feel that your violations were unjust you can email us directly to discuss them. We prefer to go through the details in private, and reach an understanding.that's poll not "pole" a poll is questions or a question and pole is probably something you would dance around...I suggest you join a CHAT room for drunks, . . a POLLING DEVICE is a CHAT device in this context, . . I know there are more serious violations than yours I've seen them too, but stop your whining and ask a real question.. as LEE so aptly put it, a question with a finite response.. NOT . How does my hair look?  that's something you ask your boy/girlfriend, i.e.  chatting/personal correspondenceHonestly, I don't see the problem!! I have reported people for serious violations like a question "regarding sex with an infant". I really do not see any violation with your questions. Beleave me there are people on this site that go way overboard, but I can't include these harmless questions.sorry cant help i had an answer removed and couldnt figure out the rhyme of reason behind it-dont know what they key in on but the program needs to be rewrote
people care because they are just too into whats tangible or in  this case visible...or to put it in easier language....people are just shallow and can't get past their looks even if its an animated look...... how absolutely pathetically sad is that!!!wy yoo alwayz gotta hate on ppl? we do things our way b chuz we all want to be individual, nd otha ppl dont start things wit othas lik yoo do jus to try to get our own self esteem up, nd if yoo cant read mai writin try to reed diz **** yoo, yoo ugly *** *****! "feel me?"It seems to correspond to people asking how their new hairdo looks, or a new garment, etc.  They want other people to confirm their taste.  Problem is, fishing for compliments can backfire.  Like the mother who asked her kid whether these new slacks made her bottom look too big.  He answered, "No, Mom, your bottom really IS that big!"I think it's cus some people care about their looks too much...or maybe they don't actually look like their avatar and want people to think that they do...some people are shallow, but not all of them.  :)I do not know this is the first I have herd of someone asking or talking about them,( how does mine look)=) haha just joking!=)because they are stupid and immature. it runs rampant on this siteYour right and by the was, how does my avatar look?...LOL. Sorry about that, I couldn't help it.u tell me
Answer questions, and answer them well in order to have them chosen as the best answer. Every time you answer a question you get two points and every time your answer is chosen as the best you get ten. You can also earn points by voting for best answers and rating best answers.When you reach your daily limit for answering questions, rate best answers, and vote on undecided questions.answer,rate and vote the max each day. don't ask questions. since you loose points. i am level 7 and haven't asked a single question.. . vote for yourself as best answer.Ask fewer questions, since these cost you points.  Answer more questions and give genuine answers that actually pertain to the question.  This will increase your chances of getting the 10 point award for Best Answer.  Also, you can vote on answers that are undecided or tied for best answer.ask less and answer moreask less and answer n rate as much as u can..if poss rate ur own answer as best..lol...hehehehe...luv u tiaCreate another ID were you rate you answers as best answers. Also answer more questions up to the limit every day.like ur name suggests that u r born confused... try to make it "born brilliant" so that u able to answer more questions... u wont be able to answer if u r confused on the contrary u would end up asking more questions... n believe me u lose a lot of points when u ask questions... so the first step wat i would suggest is----CHANGE UR NAME!!!If you answer a question, you get 2 points. If you ask one, you LOOSE 5 points. IF you choose a best answer to your question, you get 3 points and if YOUR answer is chosen as the best answer you get 10 points. So, ask less questions, answer more, write your answer in such a way that the one who asked is tempted to vote your answer as the best answer!!!!!!ask less questions, and select the best answers for the ones you do ask. and just randomly go and rate some of those resolved questions although points dont really matter. just sometimes you wanna answer questions but you run out...
Try a window cleaning product like Windex.Maybe try right-clicking on it and look for a setting that says "always on top."  Turn off or uncheck that setting and it shouldn't always be in the way.  You may also find this setting somewhere in the preferences of that application.  Just search around for it.RIGHT CLICK ON IT AND CLOSE ITGo back down to the widget symbol on the the bottom on your screen, left click on it, select close widget.  That should work for you.Restart your PC. go get a MAC. . My widgets have worked perfectly for 1 1/2 yearas never a problem
Or spell check.haha u can't even spell punctuation and why waste time lol but seriously i do that don't use punctuation a lotYes, and I use PUNCTUATION as well.Well, there are numerous of reasons. One of them would be that some people try to not be so formal and businesslike. Sometimes, it's more comforting for people to be around you when you loosen up, but this is not always the case so if you like to use proper english and the right grammar while you speak online then do that. Be yourself. Another reason is that some people are just plain lazy. They don't understand that there's a high chance that may affect the way one writes at school or at work or even in the real world.well, it made e.e.cummings a very famous man, as well as Dalton Trumbo, in fact, it isn't a very recent dismissal of punctuation marks, they've been ignored for a couple of decades now, maybe it just doesn't matter that much as long as the point is made.I think punctuation is important but its the LEAST of our worries.  How can anyone be expected to answer a question "Win da ppl tlk and spell lik dis and'spec u 2 understand wat dey r trying 2 say?"I know!!I can't believe it!!I always use punctuation and spell check and some people don't take the time!!.      .          Look how this looks with no "'?.,!:Shes so pretty Ilove her_ Look how this looks with "'?.,!:"She's so pretty!I love her."Oh, I love that answer from Big D:. . Because were typing in on the internet. it doesn't need punctuatuon . . "Were"? Or "we're"? The lack of punctuation in that one changed the word completely.. . Just because it's the Internet, doesn't mean we get to omit punctuation. It's a written medium; a text-based way of communicating. Therefore, PUNCTUATION STILL APPLIES.. . I suspect much of it has to do with ignorance: people not understanding HOW to use punctuation - so they just don't use it at all. For those who *do* know how to use punctuation and don't, my guess is that it's sheer laziness on their part. Either way, it makes the person concerned look uneducated - and when lack of punctuation is coupled with deliberately atrocious spelling, it makes them look ignorant, as well.I do not know! It is so frustrating! Do they  realize how uneducated it makes them look?. . Oh and I love the people who cannot spell at all! There is a flipping CHECK SPELLING button!I think another question to ask is why do people continue to spell words wrong on yahoo answers when there is spell check?Before you criticize others, try a little spell checki do! but yes, i have noticed that. sometimes a questions been so bad i have given up on reading it.That's an excellent question. The stupidity or the lack of caring in some people astounds me!simplicity, leaving out punctuation makes it faster when typing. the one thing that aggravates me the most is when people use the ? for an apostrophe, such as she?s so pretty.LIKE MOST OF THE OTHER COMMON COURTESIES IN LIFE, PEOPLE JUST REFUSE TO TAKE THE TIME ANYMORE.I would rather see the language cleaned up.Because they just don't know how to type.i dont know but it gets very annoying how hard can it be some people are just lazy i guessBecause were typing in on the internet. it doesn't need punctuatuonI think most people get lazy, and dont care. As far as spelling goes, there are alot of people who never were any good at it, and never cared to learn how to spell or punctuate anything properly. It is very sad, because I think it makes you look like a much more intelligent person when you can write well.
Yahoo does not display the adult groups in the Yahoo Groups directory.  There is no setting that you can adjust to see them.  Setting your profile to adult does not affect Yahoo Groups.  Yahoo hid the adult groups a few years back under pressure from some family organization.If you are not listed as an adult in your Yahoo profile, then the adult sites are blocked from you. As an adult quite often I have to prove it before I can get access to some groups.Because there are people under 18 on the World Wide Web.ummmm
answer lots of questions that don't have any answers and think about what you write, you're bound to get some 10s. . Why do you want a higher level? It's no different.Why You want alot of points?  You have only 141 points if you want to upgarde your level then encrease your knowledge level and try to answer ...
that's not gonna be easy. Yahoo or whatever company has the right to keep the password confidential for their member. Unless, of course, if you can verify her security question then you can retreive it online.Maybe spy, and when she types it she might say it aloud to remember.Why aren't you having a sit down and chat with her?depends on what site it isse if she wrote it down somewhere.or you can spy on her.but i would find out why shes cheating in the first place.
i think you should type whatever code you see.It happens to me quite a lot. And, yes. It is quite normal to me.It is a regular procedure, if you believe yahoo, go ahead other wise don't try.my server cannot be found
use the spell checker and you don't have problems anymore.... . i just say this so you don't have to hear from them again, for me you can do as much mistakes as you wish.. if i can understand i don't care...sometimes it's an impulse [i guess] but personally, i think it's not as rude as you make it sound [PLLLEEEAAASSEEE don't yell at me!!!!!!!!!!!!!] some people are just major perfectionists and want to make things right.. . if you get scolded for your grammar then don't worry about it. read it and MOVE ONso tru!!!. . does it really matter? ummm...let me think.....i think not!!. . people shud be grateful that there questions have an answer not to have a good moan. . yep, i do think it makes them feel better, to act all superiorBecause all you have to do is hit the "Check Spelling" at the top of the box, Puta!Not necessarily. sometimes spelling/grammar mistakes make it harder for a person to understand, and therefore answer a question.It's a simple way for them to feel smarter. That they miss the  entire concept of intelligence makes no nevermind.Yea..can't we all just get along???I think it's just because people love to correct others. I don't see the big deal with spelling errors. People just need to chill.They just have nothing better to do than annoy others and put them downThey mustn't have anything better to do.  Surely if the question is readable a few mis-spelled words or bits of bad grammar really shouldnt matter.good pointThey don't use the spell checker.It is probably because we see it so often. With the spell check facility readily available I think it shows that the writer is pretty sloppy in what they are doing. It is rare that I say too much about it but as an example I just answered a question about being "negagged" I can only assume that the person meant engaged.  A spell check reminder is, I hope, helpful. (Even if it is done tongue in cheek)

you need to have rhythm in order to dance. Playing Dance Dance Revolution or In the Groove is a fun way to get rhythm (although it's not *really* dancing...)fellow the music and try to be free don't think about anything except the song and how u move ... for more help smile when u dance... maybe try to have a lesson dance..You put your left foot in, . you put your left foot out,. you put your left foot in and you shake it all about.. You do the Hokey Pokey and you give yourself a spin,. that's what it's all about.There are many forms of dance. You can use a self teaching program, a dance studio, or get a friend to teach you whom knows.I tought myself how to dance and can outdance anyone in Baltimore MD.  I've been to the clubs and litterally draw all the women to dance with me.. . How?  I got mad years ago when my girlfriend moved away and then started dating someone else.  I went to a dance club for the first time.  Got drunk and just watched people dance.  Didn't try it till I went home.  Turned on MTV and watched.  I noticed that in order to look good dancing, you have to move to the beats.  Every song has differnt beats.  You'll need to simply listen to the music, it flows in patterns.  With my feet I dance to one beat and my waist to another, with my arms I usually move them to the words in the song.  I mix it up a bit but always to the beat.  The beat slows down, I slow down.  When it kicks it hard, I kick it hard.  I suggest you watch MTV and pick up some fresh new moves.  Try to imitate them in front of a mirror.  Taking Arobics really helps, as the arobic instructor gets people to move to the beat.  I dated an arobics instructor for a while too.  WOW was she hot!!!!!  N E WAY getting a little under the influence will help you get the nerve to get out there and dance.take dance lessons or just try to feel it. go with the flow.what does this have to do with yahoo products?

It seems to me that some people are just looking for somebody to confirm their personal bias. I take great pleasure in completely failing to confirm this for them and instead putting the truth. They then give the best answer to some monkey who can cut and paste the same talking points they formed the question from.Because we have a firm grasp of English.As long as they have the proper grammar, I don't see a problem. Can't say the same for you though.They are just arrogant people.Like you?that's how you perceive the toneyou sound arrogant but i agree.  they have no respect

Try creating that email address again. If someone else isn't using that email address after it expired from you, then you should be able to use it again.You should still be able to use it, but just all its content would had been deleted.

give a testrun. send an email, and wait either for mailer daemon (or what ever), either for the response of the person in question.Send an email (anonymously) to the address with some really odd news item, an urban legend, or event, or whatever so long as it is something uncomon that woud stick in your brain.. . A few days later, mention the item to the person you think it is. "I was reading in the news that..."  See if they say anything about the email.

the meaning is: Life sucks and so does this book.The fall of an African culture,in this case,the coming of Christianity versus traditional African worship.Okonkwo in the book stands for the traditional worship,Obierika stands for acceptance of christianity in his village.You will get long answers for this, but, without a lit class essay here.  It basically means entropy occurs.  That which is whole, beautiful, good will not always be so.

I don't think that it is possible to switch to an adult mode in 360 blog, However you mat restrict your entries comments to be friends.. Check privact settings. If you feel that your entries has been delted without a proper reason contact Yahoo 360 team.You can't change it just yet it's still in it's beta testing but you can read more on yahoo 360 members blog.. . Why We Limit Adult Content on Yahoo! 360°. http://blog.360.yahoo.com/product_360?p=3918Yahoo360 is not adult oriented. Adult content cannot be put up on a yahoo360 page, If you want Adult Oriented content then switch back to your regular yahoo profile, and make it adult.You are not aloud to post any obseen pictures in it or they will delete them or simply cancel you 360 profile.. . I hope this helps.......read the private policy.Why not be so adolescent and put some resonable things on there so that Everyone can view your site?. . I have never been, and now, never want to go to your site, knowing this, but, since you mentioned it, a lot of minors may go there now...  (And, thats what you wanted in the first place,eh)... . I wish you well... . JesseCan you change it to just friends of friends? and see if that helpsNah it is because most other people can't mind their own business.There is no Adult section in 360. 360 content is deleted when the TOS is not followed. That's Terms of Service that you digitally signed before beginning your 360 account.I don't think that you can....sorryuhmmm try a different website setup,,,, we at yahoo dont allow adult rated context here.. . . . . check out my 360.  Thank you.
contact yahoo help at in-mail@cc.yahoo-inc.comI agree with you.  I have a similar problem and have tried for days to get a response.  They sent a survey, try to access through customer service using an alternate email address, not a yahoo.. While searching for a similar solution, i found 1-800-318-0631  Yahoo billing, they transferred me to account verification ... less than 5 minutes and all is well.
I hate that change. Yeah, I liked getting free points. If I'm the only one who pays attention to my three-week-old question, shouldn't I get something for it? So now we have a ton of questions sitting "in voting" because nobody can vote for them.The Yahoo Gods changed that little policy a couple of weeks ago.  Lots of complaints about it on the Message Board.  Answers Matt says it was changed due to abuse.I noticed also, what a bunch of crap!it gives you an unfair advantageThat was the theory behind it.  It would help lower the amount of abuse for points.  Whether it helped or not is up for debate.Hahahaha even so you could still only vote for yours one time-at least that I am aware of. So really it didnt help me that much usually.. I guess its just another way of them trying to make it more fair! BAHUMMMMMMMMMBUG!. . On the other hand though I wish more people would go through and rate the best answer. I mean with the ones where there is only one or two answers and neither of them are great I guess I can understand why people dont sometimes. But when you get MANY great answers why not chose your best one? You get points and so do they!!!to get some of your friends to get into this to vote for your answers =)it's cheating for all the point hogsbecause thats cheatingthat citing!!!!!!!!!!you are assumed to like your own answer, so what's the point of asking you to say the obviousLet's form a coalition.Oh thank god. I thought I was losing my mind!! That's how I got alot of points too!! I agree, mutiny!!LOL, I noticed this too.  I thought it was a glitch.  I can survive without those points, I hardly ever did it.
Maybe there is some virus or spyware in your computer that hacks up your email account. Maybe you should use Spyware Detector and Anti-Virus Scan. I hope this works.Sorry, could you try to be little more coherent, since the grammatical aspect of the question is highly confusing, I fear.
It's absolutely disgusting, because it misuses the word, and normally insults people of that presentation.  In fact, my high school just had an "Anti-Hate Week" to combat such outbursts against the gay/lesbian/bi/transgender community.i think they mean that it isn't cool. it's slang like when "bad" meant good. i.e. "that's soooo bad!". a favorite quote of mine is, "It's not what they call you, it's what you answer to."people call things gay when it isn't going right.. A heterosexual person is considered as straight , where homosexual people are considered bent , hence , if something isn't going right , it is bent, or gay.. This isn't my view , so please don't kill the messenger , I am only answering your question.. P.S i don't have anything against "bi" or "homosexual" people.I dont think they mean anything by it. Sorry it offends you though
What kind of account?  If you are talking about an email account, there is no age requirement.  If she has access to a computer she can sign up for any free email service, which gives her access to all items that go along with that service.  Sounds to me like it's time to have a very long talk with your daughter.y does she need ur permission to open an account? ur not the boss of her!!!how did this happen ,the computer is in your house not ours guess you have to monitor her more, we can't monitor her !First of all you can not open any account requiring responsibility if you are under eighteen years old. This voids a contract and someone really dropped the ball or she misrepresented her age. If the company failed to take precautions to protect itself it is not your concern and maybe considered harassment if they try to collect through coercive means.Here is what I think.. . It is true that children can simply lie on applications. unfortunately due to the size and nature of the internet, most times it simply is not feasable for a business to require faxed in copies of your information, and in some cases it can even be considered unethical.. . The other side is if they required more, think of how much personal information would end up floating around in cyberspace! Identity theft would skyrocket.. . So what can you do in this situation? Talk to her, like someone else said. Find out why she wanted a yahoo answers account. Maybe she was simply curious? Maybe it peaked her brain to think? I think that if you set aside some time, and maybe create a shared account for both of you, instead of making it something she feels the need to hide it could be a very educational and bonding experience for both of you. You could help her pick the questions she wants to answer and when she asks you questions you could go to yahoo answers and ask them together. THis way you are still in control of the content and can explain anything she may stumble across that seems.. *cough* a little unsavory.. . The other thing is to in this day and age, kids are going to find the internet, no matter how much you try to protect them. So again I say the best thing to do is to try and be with her and guide her on what is appropriate. Your doing a good job to be concerned!It probably happened when she signed up. Instead of putting her real age in the questionaire box, she put an older age. You can probably contact yahoo and see if you can get the account deleted or get some kind of spyware software if you really want to protect your daughter. . . But the honest to god truth, is that their might be something lacking the relationship you have with your daughter for her to go sneaking behind your back. You need to start communicating with her, I know it can be hard but you need to take the first steps. Good Luck.Well, maybe she didn't know any better because she was not taught to ask her parents for permission first.  There are kids as young as 8 on here that I know of!  There are a lot of kids her age on here.  This fact may not make it right, but it shows that the parents are not paying attention to their kids on-line activities.I have several accounts without my parents' permission.There is no age limitation when it comes to opening an account, almost anyone can do it provided they proivde the proper ID. see BL code (198.SS.(A)(ii))
right click and delete.  But that doesn’t remove you from thiers.instead of deleting them u can just use ur stealth settings on them by just right-clicking on the contact then click on the setting that says " X sees me : permenantly offline ". so they won't ever see u online again ...Follow the written instructions on the site.you can delete them . but remember they still have your name on their list.so realy their not deleted.. have had the same problem.Keep in mind that there are some names that are almost impossible to delete.  The reason is some type of glitch.  When the person deletes a yahoo account, and the name is on your list and you want to remove it, yahoo doesn't know what you mean, because it doesn't see any such name. . . You can try thru your email address book, or go to your friends list online and try removing them the old way.. . That link is http://messenger.yahoo.com/edit/Just right click on their name and delete (find at the bottom)right click next to their name and it will say deleteremove through Address BookSelect the contact to be deleted & enter delete from keyboard, You will get confirmation window asking yes or no. If you choose yes the contact will be deleted from your list. . Else right-click on the contact-go to "Delete"-Again you will get confirmation Yes or no. Select Yes to Delete the contact from your list.. As simple as your question Dude!!!go 2 ur adress book click view edit contact and click delete
I do a lot of voting on old tied questions.  Questions stay tied until someone finally votes and breaks the tie.  There's no time limit.. . I wish Yahoo would highlight the tiebreaker questions a bit more so that more people would vote on them.let's not and say we didoh boy can weNot only points for the undecided but if 10% of those where chosen as the best answer that another 4 million points.. . Incredible. But are we really just here for points or can it be possible that people like myself are actually trying to help someone every now and then?

On Internet Explorer, go to Tools, Internet Option. The Options dialog box appears. On the General Tab at the bottom is the area for Fonts. Click on that and fix your font style and size. This exact same thing happened to me last year. I am still not sure why it changed, but I am suspecious of my kids who had their own accounts on my computer. I think they got into my internet options and played around in there. I don't know for sure that is what happened, but I know I did not change any settings there or else where on the computer. Then again they could have gotten into the desktop or file options too and changed fonts in there. If you change font style of size else where on your computer it will effect those else where like in e-mail and web pages.. . I only have IE, so if you have a differant browseer, sorry I can't help with that. However, any other browser should also have its own version of internet options. Check the tools tab or help tab or view tab or edit and see what you can find. A little detective work will often yeild great results!. . Good luck and I hope you get this fixed as soon as possible.. . p.s. there are good reasons to change font and size once in a while, but for various periods of time. If you have trouble seeing the words a larger size can help tremendously, or if you need to print out a page with too small or large print you can adjust for it temorarily and then reconfigure it back to the way it was.Copy and paste it on Word pad and change it from there... . Or, go on your browser, go to view, then text size and pick your size there...or tell your friends to stop using such small fonts when they Email!When you are in your email, click on the "view" menu on the top of your windows toolbar. Next, select "text size." I think there are 6 different size choices to choose from. That should fix your problem.Look up top on your tool bar (on internet explorer) and click on VIEW then click on TEXT SIZE and try changing it to either medium, larger, or largest. That may work.Hold the "Ctrl" button while scrolling using the wheel in the middle of your mouse.  This will change your font size.

He could have a spam blocker that is blocking your e-mails.  AOL and Outlook users get that problem alot.maybe he has accidently added you to the ignore listget him to email you, ten reply, this way you know that you have the right email address.. . there could be a spam blocker in place between you and himIt is probably going into his Spam folder. He should check there first.you may not have his correct e-mail address,,just one little dot will make the difference,,,his other girlfriend deletes themIf you use the wrong email add you will get a message saying your email was not deliverable. If you don't get this message you have to assume that the message was delivered. Maybe the others are correct in saying it went to spam.Maybe he lied about his em@il address? that it's going to someone else?he is lyingMaybe it goes to his trash/spam folder.Ask him to check for his e-mail settings, and ask him to add your e-mail id in his e-mail address book. It will definitely workmaybe he is just playing with you :)  he gets them but tell you that he doesn't, just to make you go crazy for little bit.make sure you wrtie the email address correctly . make sure it's his email address maybe he mistype it when he gave it to you, that's might happnes....Because his secretary keeps deleting them before he gets a chance to read them.  Good Luck!!!!!!!!!
Many people only read the new questions, so after the first day your question has moved so far down the line, not many people see it. If you want more answers, ask the question again.ppl only see your question on the first day cause after that other peoples questions come up and no one really looks for a specific question to answer.I have this same problem, I am still waiting for a decent answer to a question I asked 3 days ago, but am going to wait another few days and hope that someone looks a little more closely at that category.. . One thing you can do is extend the answering period, if a question has already reached the end of it's initial answering time limit.i dunno. i guess to many questions being ask and you're gets put on the second pageYou are more lucky than I am.What everyone else said is pretty much right on. Try asking your questions around 5 or 6pm when people are normally at home by that time. That way more people will see your question. if you ask during the day, normally most people will not see your questions.Other people ask questions after you so your question keeps getting pushed further back as more questions get asked.too many questions are being asked
because for many people is more easy dont think about your question and for they is better have points just with a simple way. (sorry for my bad english, I'm italian)don't know about the rest of people so I'll talk for myself.. . I do use wikipedia only to back-up something that I already know and said something about it in my own words.. . also:. 1. my English is not good enough to clarify everything i would like to say (like you asked for kaymak, I know what it is but just don't know all the necessary words to explain it). . 2.  the writing style is good so I do not need to worry about my spelling and grammar mistakes.. . 3. I often use it when answering questions in Serbian to find adequate English Translation.. . but I never use it when I now nothing about the question or answer.if you already know the answer why ask? if you want peoples opinions make sure you say so when you post a question.If you want someone's opinion, start your question with. "What is your opinion of...". . Most answers that employ a wiki link are things like. "why do boats float" or "who was thomas jefferson.".  . I seriously doubt people are providing wiki links. to Q's that ask for opinions.. . As to whether you are stupid or not, I can't say.. But this is a free, unaccountable Yahoo website.. There are lots of people out there who are asking. just to read their own words, as well as a lot of. people who really don't know why boats float (or. how to use a search engine).. . I agree that people should be able to give their. opinion, but with the myriad of possible Q's & A's. I'd say that if you want somone's opinion get right. to the point and ask for it directly.Dunno, would never do such a thing...... . Wikipedia (IPA: [/?w?ki?pi?di.?/] or [/?wiki-/]) is an international Web-based free-content encyclopedia. It exists as a wiki, a type of website that allows visitors to edit its content; the word Wikipedia itself is a portmanteau of wiki and encyclopedia. Wikipedia is written collaboratively by volunteers, allowing most articles to be changed by anyone with access to a computer, web browser and Internet connection.. . The project began on January 15, 2001 as a complement to the expert-written (and now defunct) Nupedia, and is now operated by the non-profit Wikimedia Foundation. Wikipedia has more than 3,800,000 articles in many languages, including more than 1,100,000 in the English-language version. Since its inception, Wikipedia has steadily risen in popularity[1] and has spawned several sister projects.. . Wikipedia's most notable style policy is that editors are required to uphold a "neutral point of view", under which notable perspectives are summarized without an attempt to determine an objective truth.. . Wikipedia's co-founder, Jimmy Wales, has called Wikipedia "an effort to create and distribute a multilingual free encyclopedia of the highest possible quality to every single person on the planet in their own language."[2] However, there has been controversy over Wikipedia's reliability and accuracy, with the site receiving criticism for its susceptibility to vandalism, uneven quality and inconsistency, systemic bias, and preference of consensus or popularity over credentials. Nevertheless, its free distribution, constant updates, diverse and detailed coverage, and numerous multilingual versions have made it one of the most-used reference resources available on the Internet.. . There are over 200 language editions of Wikipedia, around 130 of which are active. Fourteen editions have more than 50,000 articles each: English (the original), German, French, Polish, Japanese, Dutch, Italian, Swedish, Portuguese, Spanish, Russian, Chinese, Norwegian and Finnish. Its German-language edition has been distributed on DVD-ROM, and there are also proposals for an English DVD or paper edition. Many of its other editions are mirrored or have been forked by other websites.They want to get the points even they don´t know anything about this topic ...Why do people bother to spend their time churning out original knowledge and ideas for free?well i can't over here! just kiddin.!! i accept, there are lots over here!!FYI... not everything on the net is accurate.I agree. You should give your own version of the subject. But there is no harm in using Wilki but only to have a true answer after your theory!It's a decent answer.  For a novice to drop by and ask a real question it's actually not a bad place to start.

As the owner/moderator of a fairly active Group, the best thing is to introduce yourself and give the group members a little bit of the reason you joined.  From there, participate in the discussions and pretty soon your name will be recognized and people will be more open with you.  Don't expect this to happen right away.  It takes time for the Group members to open up to discuss personal things with a new member.Start by introducing yourself. Not your whole life history but who you are, why you joined the group, that sort of thing.. . Some of them will come back with welcomes and a bit about themselves.  The rest you will get to know by their postings.Just ask them about themselves. Many people are willing to share.
I want my own name on answers with a picture like the other kids.  can't get a new name on answers.  I need to know how also.  What's Bot?don't know if u know pls tell me
:(|) = monkey smiley  note.. the | is "shift + &#92;". .

some times the image is not supported by the software you have on your computer.  Try right clicking and selecting show picture sometimes that opens it up.Do you have images turned off in Tools > Internet Options > Advanced > Multimedia?
must be a glitch or  a yahoo thing (surprise!! lol) If you were suspended you wouldn't be able to post at all, so we just need to suck this up as a yahoo malfunction..again..Is there a limit for answering questins?Because there is limit for voting on answers!This is it may be!

vote hilary-2008!If you mean underscore, press simultaneously shift and dash. If you mean capitals vs. regular letters, then, make sure Caps Lock is not on, or that you did not accidentally press a letter key and shift simultaneously.
once you get a certain amout of points, you become a level 2 or 3 and so on and so on. You have to answer questions to get more points, and when you get enough you will be a level 2.Because you need 250 points to get to level 2.Did you just start? You need 250 points to get to level two.
The answer to your question is a secret.. . Send $59.00 in small bills.a
They're using an old Apple II Plus and there was no lower case on those computers. (Anyone remember those things!)Usually, a person who types in all caps is lazy. They just hit the Caps Lock and type. They think they are above proper grammar and that people that find them annoying are being petty. But then if you ask them to be considerate, they laugh and say no. They are rude and do not care if it makes them appear uneducated. Oh well.  Children (and immature adults) will be children I guess.. . Well, englishprince26 & jimbob_ellen have just proven my pint.  Thank you!I think it is also because the person has a big ego and they are trying to prove their point, or maybe they are so dumb that they can't figure out how to turn it off.My guess is sometimes people are yelling (not just to you) but yelling about something.  Or, they could be typing and not realize their cap lock is on and just don't feel like taking it off, or maybe they just don't care.  I'm with you, I too tend to skip over questions and answers with caps because I too find it annoying.IT ANNOYS ME TOO!it's to get thier question noticed.it is to express anger or show empasis on a particular word in the type world.  I think it is reall f*&^ing annoying when people type whole letters or memos all in caps!Because most people who buy computers can't type.  Plus they're ignorant.  Personally, I feel that anyone who is buying a computer needs to pass a typing test.  They fail - they get a typewriter.. . I learned to type properly in Grammar School.Yes it's either they are yelling and mad about something or they want to get their point across. Or maybe they just wanna attract attention. It's abit rude to use it unnecessarily...they don't know any better, no manners or maybe they are yelling at you :-)It is the same when you are on a chat site.  Normally they are yelling at you.  There are some people out there I guess that think they need to be aggressive with others.  They are probably abusive, disruptive, immature, and just don't know proper computer educate.  Sorry you had to encounter such a rude person.  Better luck in the future.usually, they are trying to make a point or they r stupidIt's because they don't know how to use grammar properly and therefore cover it up by TYPING LIKE THEY'RE YELLING AT EVERYONE. A few exclamations hammer home the point that they can't use correct punctuation either.
Makes sense to me.I guess it could mean a broken heart.  I never found it on any of the lists I looked at.
Collecting points if you read the community guide lines is not to take place. Under Content & useage item #4 states you should not collect points for gaming purposes yet Answers displays those with the most points so people will work towards earning the most points...Answers violates there own rules here...Silly isn't it...We should receive an award for helping out!!!it's funI really dont care.  Im not sure i really have a question worthy of asking yet  though when i think of one ill askI have no idea im only on level two but had fun getting there and im dying to get to level three but i think the fun will stop there as i have noticed no benefits on level twoto kill boredom...It's a way for me to procrastinate, with "rewards" on the side.its fun to see how fast u can move up to the next level

you might have to edit your settings.  But I did hear that Yahoo was having a problem with this over the weekend.  It was supposed to have been repaired but you might need to put in another trouble ticket.i am not sure why.go back into your groups setting for that particular group you want and allow messages posted to be sent via email. as opposed to "i will read it on the message board".
Interesting idea. I will take the suggestion back to the team to talk about making this a possibility.at the top of the page there is a "forum" ... or. . at the bottom there is a "tell us what you think"Y_Answrs_team@yahoo.com. . There is no e on answers.That sounds like a neat idea. Try the bottom of the page, where it says, "tell us what you think"
Under the "Messenger" menu at the top you will see a menu item "My Contact Details". Click on that, and edit the first name and last name appropriately. You can remove them if you only want you Yahoo! ID to show, or enter whatever you want.messenger >> preferences >> appearance . For each contact on the messenger list. shows their:. click the button "yahoo ID". click apply & ok. ^_^
I wondered the EXACT same thing!!! I think it must be some kind of glitch that occured whenever one of the recent updates was added.I think it is a problem in the answer systemsi have no idea i was wondering that too why dont u email yahoo about this question!May be it is because you and so many others are so rude and insulting to others. The feel the need to express the emotions you trigger in them, and unfortunately that is one way they express them.Because people are gay Fuck them, or shall I say f u c k :)you might want to let the cyberangels know their filter isn't workingThat particular word has showed up from one of the answer from one of my questions.. . Why...I don't know. I did reported this to Yahoo.. . The link is on the bottom. The user who used the f-word is djdeksiThat's a good question...

Depends if you bought extra storage.  I have 1.0 GB Yahoo!  I have only 250 MB Hotmail.1 GB for a free account. 2 GB to 4 GB for the accounts you have to pay for monthly.you didn't mention which carrier.  different carrier has different quotadiff mail server have diff quota's ..yahoo have 1 GB.

You can't add the badge to your Yahoo! homepage for sure... But you can only put them into websites that you can edit, like a myspace or xanga (possibly any others).. . Nitrogen.Go to "My Q&A", copy the html code. Open geocities and sign in. Edit "index.html" and paste the html code in there. Save your changes and view your site. Well I know this hasn't helped much.

they do?My guess would be to prevent the same person from spamming this place over and over again. Although there's nothing to prevent a person from creating multiple yahoo accounts, but I guess that would be annoying for the spammer.
I guess that that depends on where you live.  In WI just type in simple case search and then you can do an all state search or do a search by county.the private eye thing you have to pay for.  did you know that you are entitled to a free credit report once per calendar year? go to any of the credit bureaus (experian, etc.) and register with them.  by law they need to give it to you free.When you find that answer, let me know. I haven't found one yet.you can look your self up and background checks on google for free just type in your name and on the right side it will say privite eye.click on it.
On the Yahoo home page, near the bottom where it says "More Yahoo! Services", click on "Members" and enter the search criteria you have in "Find people on Yahoo!" to search for Yahoo ID or Real name or whatever. Coincidentally, it brings you exactly to the page celery pointed out with the link in her answer!If a person for sure has a yahoo membership, you can go to http://members.yahoo.com and you should be able to search for certain people, and then if they have a profile you can click on it.Ashlieetype the following example if you know the persons name..  http//profiles.yahoo.com/nameJust look it up OK.
Yahoofs? or Yahoo?. Yahoo (dictionary means) A crude or brutish person. ^_^Didn't know you knew about horses.Yahoofs is a newly discovered abnormaltly in the foot of a horse.When the vet goes to the barn to check the horeses.He asks the rancher if he has noticed anything wrong with the horses lately.If the rancher has noticed them walking gingerly,he will tell the vet.And the vet will say(I actually heard the vet say this.)YA-HOOFS.Sure hope this helps you out.

To block an e-mail address, log on to your mail account then on the top right you will Options and under Spam--> Block Addresses-->Enter email address (or domain) to block.. Also when they e-mail you check the box next to the e-mail and then click "spam".. The e-mail will start going to your bulk file which is your junk/spam file and empty it out.. To block it from your messenger put their address on your "ignore list".. Log on to your messenger and then click on "messenger". Messenger-->Preferences--> Ignore list.I am not sure that I understand your question. You want to block someone else's email address?  I just click around on things until I find something out.  Of course you can crash your computer with my method.
Put all addresses in the BCC field.use the bcc: option.  (blind carbon copy)well, you should e mail one person then blind copy (Bcc) the rest, this enables no one to know who has else has been e mailed as it is blind.If you don't want anybody to see the emails of anybody, you can send it to yourself (put your own address in the to:) and then put everybody else in bcc, blind carbon copy. That way everybody only sees your email, which they should know anyway.

The best use of on-line translators is from the foreign language into your native langauge.  That way you can (mostly) understand what is meant and fix it up.  It would be worth asking someone to translate (as was said) in order to make sure it gets your meaning across and isn't nonsense.try www.freetranslation.com . It will translate literally though, so perhaps best to pay a small sum to have the letter professionally translated
unclick the check mark "remember my ID on this computer"Create password accessed user accounts.. If you have Windows go to Start--Settings--Control Panel--User Accounts.

check out your sentence structure people give answers to your questions as they feel fit that is the persons option . thank youyour question is nigh on to impossible to understand, but if i read it right(?), you cannot stop people from giving those ridiculous answers such as DUH!, etc. There seems to be a lot of people who see this as a game and a creative but non-thinking writing exercise and all they see is KA-CHING as the points add up.Slurpee.Work on your sentence construction for one thing.. . Just ignore them.
I give up.  Why do you want to take a biology course?If you are planning to go into the medical field, or medical support, biology is probably a required course (as would be chemistry).. .

You know those pink Hostess Snoballs?. yeah. same thing.. Only they are safer.Latin for Six (6)What gender you are-male or female., sex is conventionally perceived as a dichotomous state or identity for most biological and social purposes, such that a person can only be female or male. However, when the criteria generally used to define femaleness and maleness are examined more closely, it becomes apparent that the assignment or determination of 'sex' occurs at multiple levels. Environmental, biological, social, psychological and other factors are all believed to have some role in this process, and the complex interaction of these factors is expressed in the diversity of biological and psychosocial 'states' or levels found amongst the human population. A significant fraction of the human population simply does not correspond exclusively to either 'female' or 'male' with regard to every level of definition expressed in the following table. This discordance is discussed in more detail below.wen u want to make babies nan and women kiss and then play around a bit the man puts his member in to girl and move a bit member spits and gril release egg sperm meets with egg hey preston baby is made.You are too young to post here. Ask your mommy.If you do not know what sex is, I suggest you go ask your parent(s)so that they can explain to you what it is, so that you do not get confused by what anyone else tells you about sex. And, if you have to ask that question, then you surely shouldn't be asking strangers on here what it is. I personally think your probably a Teenager looking for some answers from people on here, when it is your parent(s) that need to do the talking and tell you. And, I think you should be married when you have it. Just go talk with your parent(s).You will find out when you are old enough.....dont worry about it :)WHAT YOU HAVENT GOTTENWhy do people fckin keep asking such fckin stupid questions?????????????it is wonderful, if you're responsible. make it meaningful.  you don't have to be married to have sex.  it changes alot in your life.  just make sure you're ready for it before you actually have sex.  and be sure to use a condom if you do.  theres no use in killing yourself for pleasure.
Have u installed it?Does it happen to be telling you that your password is incorrect?  This happened to me, i never changed my password so i think yahoo deleted my original account.  Try creating a new name just to try logging on if it works, then you know this is what happened.  Good luck!. . (this is assuming by connected you meant, service wise, not connected with other people...)its mayb cuz yahoo closed ur account or u have old versionif you have a fire wall or are using proxies it will not work also you might want to delete yahoo messanger restart your computer go to yahoo.com and download it againYou already have a Yahoo account, so either you have not download Yahoo Messenger or you forgot to make a shortcut to your desktop or you need to make sure you downloaded Yahoo Messenger for your version of Windows.. . Good Luck!
they are better insulated so sweat more and that encourages bacteria growth in damp dark warm places. just fact!Oh man, I love this site!cuz they can't clean themselves properly ewwthe same reason a skinny person smells, cuz THEY DON'T WASHUP OR TAKE A SHOWERBecause they are fat.Fat people smell bcoz the Fat inside their body produce Sweat which will a little sour other than normal body ...Because they are sloppy eating hogs, Look at their shirt and comment on you can tell they had eggs for breakfast, beware of the ones that so, no, I had them last week.why do you go around sniffing them?Could be what they eat.
Once you have yahoo 360 it's always there. But, you can put everything to private, and uncheck the box that is beside activate my yahoo360 link... (ect) go thru on each page, mark everything private, and save it all. this way no one can see your yahoo 360 page, but just you. Take down any links you have to your yahoo 360 page, this way no one will be confused when they try to go to it and them not be able to see it, that way you won't get flooded with emails or anything.You cannot cancel it....all you can do is to empty it. You can delete everything on it, even your nick. Good luck :)
I use it often because it's a good way to get to know people and make new friends. And you can keep all your friends on Yahoo posted about what's going on in your life all at the same time because on your messenger it shows when you've updated your profile or blog or anything.Its kind of fun making blogs and putting up pictures and seeing what others do. . . Kind of like your personal chat room if you want it to be. . . I'm to lazy on it currently but when you get going you can't stop. I like it though. Store lots of info there to if you want.I use it to post stories of my travels that people ask about. I also take photos of my art for people to view.i use it to make friends and find people that live near me or in the same town
They are trying a new home page.   I don't care much for it.  The old one was much better.I don't what it look like before but,yeah i agree it does look better. !!!  I too don't know why it change , probably to improve the site , that usually a good reason(s) why people change to improve it MAKE IT BETTER FOR ALL OF US !!because it was long overdue for an upgrade!yahoo is going beta. a slang for better (just kidding). it is an upgrading of a system which work just fine for me. been on beta for a couple of months.cuz this one is way betterbecause they must have thought it needed changes and I like it but I dont know about you.
Are you using wireless? If so, then you might want to upgrade your wireless drivers... . If your using a LAN cable and its happening you might want to check your system out for spyware.Like what the guy above me said, it might be the wireless connection.  This usually happens to my friend that is constantly logged off and on because someone uses the phone around her and she crashes.. . But yeah, check either your router or actual internet connection, and maybe the service provider.. . Anyways, good luck with this and my wishes for everything to go well.
I wondered this a while ago, so checked the old questions, and this was the only one to work. If it's the Yahoo search bar you want to erase the history from then click in the search bar so that it drops down with items you've searched for, then highlight an item with your mouse, and press delete (not backspace-the delete button above the cursor keys) and the highlighted item will be erased. Repeat for all items.In IE - Tools > Internet Options. On the General tab, click "Clear History"tools - internet options - clear history. or. tools - browser options - clear URLIn Mozilla, just in case: Edit > Preferences > History > Clear Location Bar
You go to edit my profile and click on the link for yahoo avatar and on then click on the tab labeled extras and then click on the link labeled pets.  Instead of clicking on the favorites link just click on the picture of the dog and it should just appear next to the avatar girl. The problem where the girl not coming off is because it is not an option. Having the dog in the picture is just an extra detail.The display of the Yahoo Avatar on Answers automatically defaults to the face of the avatar.  I do not think that can be changed.. . If you want to use some other pic or a photo, then this requires a 360 account and this is a 3 step process. . 1) you'll need to create your Yahoo! 360 account. http://360.yahoo.com. So far, this is the only option if you want to use some other picture or photo.. The only three options for pics you have on your Answers profile is no pic, Yahoo avatar, or 360 picture.. . 2) you'll need to upload a couple of pictures to your 360 page.. On your 360 page, select "My Page" from the top. Select "Edit Personal Photos" on the left hand side. Browse to your saved photo(s) (assuming you have one or more ready) to upload it.. Select the "Set as Primary" button next to the photo want displayed on other sites (like Answers) and select "Save". . 3) you'll need to display your 360 picture on Answers. Go to your "My Q&A" page, select "Edit My Info". In the "Picture" section, select "Use my Yahoo! 360 Picture" . This link will get you to that page, http://answers.yahoo.com/my/my_editGo to the avatars page, click on My Favorites icon. click on Favorite Avatars ,. 2click on your dog. you have to see it on Previewing Changes then click on Save changes buttongo to avatar to change your avatar to the dog.click the picture it should take you to browse and choose the pic from above where your avatar is.

click actions on ur messenger and select call set up. Here a new window will open and will guide u how to configure ur headset with yahoo messneger.I bet you are behind an HTTP proxy.

Answer to the question left in these comments about Yahoo! Avatars:. . Yes they are free, no you don't need Yahoo! 360 account, and go to the following site to get one. :). . http://avatars.yahoo.com/YEAH, WHAT THE FIRST GUY SAID. MY ONLY QUESTION IS AND AS WEIRD AS IT SOUNDS DO YOU HAVE TO SIGN UP FOR YAHOO 360 TO GET AN AVATAR. AND IS YAHOO 360 FREE? I WANT AN AVATAR BUT IF IT'S NOT FREE THEN FORGET IT. JUST CURIOUS.
if you want the full picture use the print screen function and go paste it to the paint program. You can crop and save to the computer then. I did it myself for my blog on my 360 page.  take careright click and ckick save picture as. . or right click and copyGo to the Avatar homepage and you can export it.. http://avatars.yahoo.com/export.html;_ylt=AuoS1qgGeXtK2t02psU8DDYi0A5.?src=ymail
go to options by clicking the srrow next to "Mail" at the top. Go to signatures and pick Color and Graphics as the formatting. Then copy and paste the image.Go to your mail and click on Options near the top right of the page.  Click on Signature.  Go crazy.I also thought you could switch to HTML eMail instead of plain text and can use HTML to create what you want as well.
I don't understand it myself. Why do people have to attack the person for asking a question? It's the playground equivalent of ... "I'm smart your dumb, nanny nanny boo boo stick your head in doo doo... like a baby suck your thumb cause you is dumb dumb dumb.". bullies... they are everywhere.Lolo, some people don't care to hurt others. They are just selfish, insensitive fools who think they can make themselves feel good by putting others down. Just ignore them...i will lick ur pussyIt is just a way to get attention*Because there's alot of bad stuff going on around here.. *People are impolite out of spite (meanness&#92;rudeness).. *I have things like that happen to me also.. *People like to be mean.. . *made a typo...i just fixed it.Well, I suppose online, people feel safer to be "rude" because it's basically anonymous. No, it is definitly inapporiate to be call someone an idiot or a moron just because you don't like their question or opinion.. . BTW- Slowly, our entire nation is morphing into a fast food nation, and my question was just a question about statistics. Statistics can be wrong, but that's why they're called stats. They don't apply to everyone...just the majority.cause they dont know how to respond in a decent matter.
There are two possibilities. If you are using Y!A avatar there is a possibility that the picture might not load due to a busy server problem.. If the picture is loaded from a user’s blog and was somehow improper, Y!A team have the right to censor it, and then it wont upload for other users.I have the same problem.  sometimes I see a red X.  Don't know why it does thatI think it's a yahoo thing.  Sometimes I come and go in the member directory.        OOH, spooky!It could be a problem with the way your internet browser displays images, or it could be a bug.  This web site is still relatively new and there are still some problems to be worked out.  You should report your problem to Yahoo.I think its because your computer loads a little slow...It may also be how well your Internet is connecting and working. When I'm on Y! e-mail, the pictures are little boxes until I reply the e-mail.my cat's breath smells like catfood
Sounds like you need to switch to "plain text" mode for composing messages.  You can do this by clicking the "Options" link in the upper right corner of Yahoo Mail, then click the "General Preferences" link and choose the "plain text" option for Composing Emails.  Finally click the "Save" button.It seems when they filled in their profile, they, for whatever reason, didn't allow for E-mails to be returned to them. Either by error, or they just didn't wish to be bothered by them. A bit frustrating at times. Particularly when they e-mailed you. They I suspect, missed clicking on that return box.Some people have to be careful and withhold their details, some people just don't want trolls pestering them :(
many are bitter about something in their life and they think they will feel better if they take out their anger on some stranger. but it doesn't work.Cuz they're just waiting to chew an a$$. This is spozed to fun, ain't it?! Maybe I got it all wrong... I don't know!Your English is atrocious.  What you need to do is to learn the basics of good grammar.THYE ARE JUST LOOKING FOR SOMETHING TO DO BECAUSE THEY I HAVE LIFE OF THERE OWN. MYSELF I WOULD LIKE TO HELP PEOPLE IF I CAN.because the world is run by by my da....satain...that a$$hole!"It's all in good fun. No harm. Why...whats it to you??? SIKE!!! ". . Ah ha ha ha, it's "Psych"!!! ROTFLMAO :P. . WTF is SIKE?Perhaps because of their limited intelligence.Some hidden darkness in their past, it's all in their personality. Or they are just being goofy because nobody can trace them.They either wnat points or are being mean. I hate those people. It is like they have nothing nice to say but just want to say it.Probably either because the question stirs them up or it is so stupid they can't think of anything else to say.It's all in good fun. No harm. Why...whats it to you??? SIKE!!!they just want the pointsIt is an easy way to blow off some stress.  How serious can anyone be to ask a huge group of strangers for answers anyway?Because it doesn't matter what they actually say, it earns them 2 points!!. I feel sorry for the people who do it because they only make themselves look totally stupid.......... but then again I don't think they really care, which is sad in itself really!!. . Just ignore them, they aren't worth getting upset about.because life's not all shi.ts & giggles, there are alot of people out there who are bitter because they think that life has denighed them some thing, but for the most part they are deniging them self somethingwho cares
I assume that the 2 answers worked for you but wanted to point out that you can't have it open when trying to uninstall.Go to Control Panel. Then click Add or Remove Programs. Find Yahoo Messenger on the list and click it and then click Remove.Either go to Control Panel > Add Remove Programs, and find it in the list.  Failing that, you can sometimes navigate in Windows Explorer to C:&#92; then Program Files, then Yahoo.  Sometimes there will be an app you can double click to run called uninst or something similar.  What version are you running?
Yep ! By being chose as the Best answer you get 10 points, please choose me, I'm low on points I gave you the right answer didn't I?i have been studying how people at the top of the table have been so successful.when i carefully studied answers of these people ,i found some similarities.. . most of these people put so much thought,effort & time into their answers.they strive for perfection in each answer. . most people like jane furrows are really good observers.jane carefully studies a question & comes with lots of outcomes for the same questions.she lists down different sides of the same problem.askers like such approaches .she never comes up with a single conclusion ,but a group of them.the user can pick from them.try this approach and list down the answers as points. . people like richard,mix humor with their answers & they are really good at it.I wont recommend it if u aren't good at it.bad humor actually will reduce your chances.. . try learning more about the asker .what kind of answer he's really looking from the question-if he just needs a time killer,or if he actually needs help.. . . for certain questions  u need to give the make 'feel good type' of answers -questions like if u liked an actor of his choice or if a team might win a match or so.even if u don't like the actor,never be rude-never .don't give answers like "i hate him". choose the middle path-try to find both good & bad aspects of the star.must seem honest when you praise.he's just asking for an 'evaluation'.that's all u have to do!!in that way you are not cheating your conscience .. . when u are writing a big answer try using spaces in b/w.the readers may actually get annoyed otherwise,however good your answer might be!just like i did here. . choose your field of expertise and try answering questions related to your interest. . sometimes few of  your very good answers might go to voting stage.in that case u need to defend your answers.very few people actually participate in voting.most of them don't care reading your answers.. . don't be dissapointed if few of your good ones don't return the best results ,coz u might end up getting best answers for few ordinary ones!!. . u always gain with experience.also read more resolved questions,to gain knowledge.. all these have started to help me.just started using them only since a week.but got a few potentially good answers waiting to be resolvedI have! But I'm not sure if this is the same way you get yours so please tell me!!!!!!!Yea.. when ppl dont come back to choose the best answer and the answers are voted.. Vote for ur own answer ;) and u will get best answer by 1 VOTE ...u will be the only person who voted for usually!!Yes.Yes but it is against the TOS.You could be banned.Answer the crazy questions?Nope.tell me, i don't know and i want to know.Yes, just be the first person to give the best answer to the question.yeh its so simple...asnwer some question tat none has answered!!!!yes
If you browse through Questions with Best Answers already chosen, you can comment on the Best Answer if you'd like. That what the comments are.it's an after effect. the question is answered, but you still feel like putting in "the last word". that is what the comments are for.Thats how many people commented on your question.comments on other best answers... few people do it but if you feel the need to say something about the answer thats the only way to do it once it is close and resolved
I have no clue.. but I love money too. =)They are allowing self voting now.
faithexplain more!what do u meen!if u have your securuty questions u can ask from yahoo,and they send for u a New PWYou have to click on the button for the forgotten password and they will send you a new one.  Then you can change it.did you forget yours? if so, you have to click on "forgot password"...i don't think you can find out what it is right now, but i've never lost my password, so i'm not sure.
Make sure they have told Yahoo Answers to use the Avatar in the first place.. . Go to MYQ&A and click on "EDIT MY INFO". . Under the Picture setting, they must click use my Yahoo Avatar.i have the same problem , and mine won't show on here .You probably don't have the circle checked, where is says "share my avatar. you can click on the avatar picture in Yahoo Instant Messenger,go to my display image, & then to choose to customize the avatar you want, &  click the circle where is say to share your avatar, the click OK.Sometimes, my avatar doesnot show up.idk i have the same problem
If you don't now screen name you can try the different search options.  Go to the search section of your 360 pagehttp://360.yahoo.com/user    the user id goes at the end of that link just put that persons id at the end and there you gotype in their email addi or screenname imder the 360 searchJust like that, check out mine.
http://www.soyouwanna.com/site/syws/changename/changenameFULL.html. . that website should give you all the info you needyou have to get it done through your local council or failing that through the court, or you could just tipex over it and pretend you got it changed legally!YOU NEED TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE IT DONE LEGALLY. I THINK THE FATHER WOULD HAVE TO GIVE UP HIS LEGAL PARENTAL RIGHTS IN ORDER TO DO IT THOUGH....

You can't change  your Yahoo screenname.  You have to sign up for a new account.You need to close your current account and sign up for a new one.ask yahoo staff. that would most assuredly help
Read YA Community Guidelines, by clicking on it at the bottom of this page.If you dont want to receive any notices or warnings from YA, then dont violate the guidelines mentioned.When asking questions, see to it that no. 4 has  a tic mark on it. The one that says: "Yes, email me answers as they are posted."When you ask your question, there is a check mark at the very bottom. It is next to step 4: Email Notification. If you don't want to be emailed, get rid of the check. I always get the notification.By not violating any of the rules.Do you mean emails to say you have had a answer to your question? you need to uncheck the box at the bottom of the screen when you type your question saying that you want to be emailed answers, then you wont get anybeccuse you is stupid and you probably don't know how to do it.
They do the same thing to me.  They still haven't figured out good manners yet when it comes to answering email.It's a conspiracy! One of my questions got deleted because it violated the yahoo guidelines, I was very angry.to answer questions like these!!!!!lolnothing. its just that these days goverment and restriction rules are complicated. there might be kids under 10 here, for gods sake. but, some of it might be their problemn. email them.
Do you have the newest version 7.5? If not, then go to messenger.yahoo.com and download the newest version of messenger.. This should alleviate any of your problems.. . Hope that helps..If Ignore User isn't working go to Yahoo Helper and find alternative solutions.. If the spams still keep coming in, I suggest making another account.ignore them
I know this sounds dumb, but just be yourself and be honest. Try to find something you like that others will be interested in as well!and eight year old cant. a 12 and 13 year old IS a teen. so if your 8-10 dont count on itwhat is your question? i don't understand it
I try to avoid those questions. But sometimes they are so dumb it requires a really sarcastic answer.A chance to try out some humor maybe :) points look pretty all gathered together in one place so cute! . My precious my precious-es? That a word :). or if very very distasteful to say reported!. .  ----> . . <---- two points!. Now if only some points to the points!. truthfully I did not notice the points till I was here a while. I came in through a search engine to ask a question, and started answering ....addictive but I am tiring of it finally....just one more first ;)Georgie just hit it right on with his answer.. . It depends on my mood at the time but some of the many dumb questions just deserve a sarcastic reply.yes, for the points, but not alwaysYes. Thank you for the points.Yep. Thanks for the points.Just to confirm the intelligence level of the masses. Data goes into the ever-growing pulsating brain known as our collective conscience.

you have to go to attachments and select remove attachmentI assume you're in Yahoo mail?  If so, all you have to do is click "compose," and you will get a clear screen.  The "attach files" icon (gray box) is just there if you have files to attach.  It will not affect writing your letter and sending.
You probably have the setting set to sign you on invisible. You can still talk to people your just invisible. To change it when you sign on just change that setting before logging in.perhaps your status is appear invisible to everyone so you have to click on the toolbar and put the available option.
I have a suggestion, possibly a solution for you, however it is fairly conditional.   Provided that you can get past this message and actually use yahoo messenger for few moments then you should be able to do the following.  On your main yahoo messenger window, go to "Messenger" then "Privacy Options" then Under categories on the left choose ignore list then click "add" and type in the screenname of the person that had added you, then click on and save changes or whatever.  the next time you log in... the message should not come up, because they are on your ignore list now....u know wat the bested way is to just make a new yahoo messenger account take the simple way out and make a new one and then keep the friends that u want it doesnt take that long

You need to invite them. You can do this by either sending an invite from their 360 page or sending them an email from your 360 page.Lady Laura is correct...for a 360 account.

If it's your yahoo account that you want to cancel then just don't log into it for a while - it expires and the account is automatically closed for you. All email accounts do the same - the time you have to wait varies. (Yahoo is something like 6 - 8 weeks.)You can go to this page:. . https://login.yahoo.com/config/login?.slogin=&.intl=us&.src=&.bypass=&.partner=&.done=https%3a//edit.yahoo.com/config/delete_user&pkg=&owd=. . At this page, sign in to the account which you want to cancel using that account ID & password. Once you are in, then just delete it. But you will NOT be able to reactivate that account once you've deleted it, so be careful, that's all. GOOD LUCK

Everything.Any and all. The questions have to be interesting or it depends on what mood I'm in to answer.I answer from the open questions category. I also answer my friends questions alot.I always stay on the first 'page'. All catagories is what is listed.I LOOK FOR THE STUPIDEST QUESTION SO I CAN GIVE EVEN STUPIDER ANSWERSI try to get a good mix Of all of themmostly on mathematics and words & wordplay. I also answer questions in other categories (not all, just a few), but that only happens when a question seems to interest me.car maintenance and repairs and Pets.  It's what I know best.Them all...you can't know all the answers.I just keep refreshing the main page and answer all the new questions if I could.I spend time in Books & authors, Music and Television.i like the romance ones .. like singles and dating, sometimes it just nice to read questions and know that people have it worse than you.. and other times its nice to actually be able to help someone outall of themWhere I can find legitmate,intelligent, and mature questionsAny category - I pick out questions that I know answers to, have experience of, or just those that interest meThe ones that I feel more comfortable with, thanks to the knowledge that I possess.i do not knowall of them.
On your messenger window. There's a button near the top with a smiley face and a plus sign on it. Click it. Add your friend's screen names.click. add a contactClick on contacts.. Then click on add a contact.
Wow, I am glad you asked that. I thought it was just me..... Anyone know the answer?Glad its not just me...But yeah if you keep clicking on the home page they will come up.I almost moved and got something doneyeahh me 2 maybe it was the president's speech that blocked them jajaGlad it's not just me.I'm guessing the questions are answering themselves.yea i thought i was just me too, so i just clicked music, hmm thats weird but w.e. u kno DUCES!It's a beta version.  Maybe they will be back, maybe not.. . My guess is they will.They're back!!!i'm wondering the same thing, must be a glitch. click on the home link.I know man, I think they are trying to upgrade the network!. I though I had some kind of virus or something!? . I'm glad that I'm not the only one, it started yesterday May 15 about 9pm australian( melbourne) time!. I think they should at least mail us or somethig!. Or maybe their memory is going bezerk!. Whatever is going on, they better explain themselves the quicker, the better!So it just isn't me? They must have some kind of problem here tonight.i donno it happen to me alsosystem update. it's not gonna last. yahoo will notice.that was weird, i thought I'd answered too many q's and they wouldn't show me them...weird...I dont know it is telling me there r no questions left but there r plenty and it is making me so MADgood question i was just wondering that my selfIt's a bug in the Yahoo! server. They usually fix it pretty fast so just be patient.I was wondering the same thing! . Maybe  a problem with their program?Yeah, really, almost had a panic attack there. No questions means no answers. What would I do with my life? LoLI just asked the same thing.
I am addicted also! It"s not the points cause you can"t buy anything with them. I love it when I get picked BEST ANSWER!It just makes you feel good! I also like chatting with other people and sharing my experiences and knowledge with them.Who ever thought of this was a genius!lol im addicted to it to. Its just something different n kinda fun to do when ur boredits hilarious to make fun of peoplenot sure just board i guessboredomI really love people and I like to help them.  Most of the time I answer questions about the Bible and John 17:3 says, "This means everlasting life, their taking in knowledge of you, the only true God, and of the one whom you sent forth, Jesus Christ".  How much greater satisfaction could a person have than knowing that they have helped someone (either a reader or an asker) to get everlasting life?im answering questions because i have no questions to ask. like u my answers my not be right, but i want to say things thats on my mind.its relaxing to sit and see what people ask and read the asnwerswell, it depends on the questions. if someone's aksing serious ones, u give them honest answers. if someone's just asking stupid questions, then they have a right to get silly and equally stupid answers! basically having fun :)I came to this sight legitimately looking for an answer for a sick Animal.  Some of the questions are disgusting, some have been actual Predators, but People didn't seem to see that.  Then there are those who have real problems that they need help with, and if it is something You have experienced, why not reach out?I like writing, even if it is just to "hear" myself talk.. Sometimes it helps me think better.. Sometimes I think I have something worthy to contribute. :)answering questions is better than watching the crap on tv this time of night.i'm not sure. but for me it's just a way to talk to others(sort of)I just like being able to help people answer their questions. Also, I have been trained to look for information on the Internet, so I feel, although I'm not getting paid hard cold cash for doing this, I can help people - which is what I want to do in my library career.I have to say... the useless points. ;)It's like pushing the button on LOST, I have no idea.points

nothing much.  if enough people complain they take your answer down and i think they dock you like 3 points or something.It depends on the severity of the abuse and/or the number of violations you have.

Re install yahoo from the original setup file again and then try to re install.GO TO START THEN TO SETTINGS,THEN TO CONTROL PANEL GO TO TH ADD AND REMOVE , CLICK ON YAHOO MESSENGER AND THEN CLICK ON REMOVE,For those of you are having problems with Yahoo Messenger and you've done everything else known to man and beyond then this page [Remove/Delete] and following [Clean Install] are perhaps your next step in trying to correct the problem... at this point I'm assuming that you really have tried everything.. including contacting Yahoo by using their [Yahoo! Help Feedback Form] and following their own instructions... if not please do so as it's thier program and they know best.. we hope ;-) Anyway, like I said I'm assuming you've taken all measures available that includes making sure your computer is up to date with patches, critical update files, system files etc and that you haven't just sat there and gone "umm.. well I think it is" make sure that it is and that you're prepared to do some reading and learning along the way.. the steps below and on the[Clean Install] page are provided as is where is.. check out our site [disclaimer] for clarification :-)
Do you mean on Yahoo! Messenger? Look for a gray smiley face in front of the name -- that means that the person is not online.If they are on your buddy list, then if they are online the smiley face will be yellow, or there picture will be beside there name, if they are not online you will see a grey smiley face, meaning they are offline.
If you wanna see which friend is online visit download it and type in your friends ID and it will tell you who is online and who isn't. Have fun and good luckNone can be invisible. Reserces have found the way to be invisible (for military) but that way is not in use.. If you think about spirits (pneumas) we cannot find nothing. Some people say that spirits comunicate with a person if they want. I don't know I have not meet a spirit but I would like to meet one.
As new questions come it, the older questions get pushed further down in the list and often go unnoticed. You can't post the same question twice (that's a violation), but if you don't get a response, delete the question, then ask it again. Also, be sure to put your question in the correct category. I think a lot of questions go unanswered because they aren't categorized correctly.because more people see ur question in the first few minutes && hours, because there showed ont he top of the "new qyestions" thing.i agree with what has been said pretty muchBecause the new questions show up on your page as an answerer.  As they get older, you have to look for them, so it's only if you come across them that you may answer them.Yea I hate when that happens. It matters what category it is in. If it is a popular category You will get answers in 15 minutes and then it will stop because it will not be at the main page or that categorys main  page. Once your question is not in the last 10 asked in that category no one will see it or answer it. .  .        That is why I believe that answers should let a question after a few days when you extend the expiration it moves to the top of the page again. So that you can get more answers o your questions.because they are featured early and are at the topBecause right after you ask a question it goes into the list of most recently asked questions which pop up in the "answers section" People don't really search for questions to answer - they just go with the questions they see right away.because it's at the top and a new one open brand new answers and pick a busy timeProbably because there are so many questions. I think the newer questions go to the top of the list. It is ok to re-ask the question or you could post a new question with a link to any other question which needs more answers. You could try to ask the question again in a different way.Some people probably don't look further than the first pages. . . I, on the other hand, usually go back as far from the last time I visited the site. . . Yes, once your question ages in certain categories, people will probably be unlikely to see it unless they search for it, or look for it their self.. . I think you can extend periods of asking questions, you could try that. Asking the question again seems to be a waste of points, but I suppose if that's what you've got to do, that's what you've got to do.if you need more answers, by all means, post it again. that's fine. and yes...they go back really far...what i do is ask people to answer my questions...so you can do that too. see, i have 11 open now..do you want to check em out? you might get a best answer in there then...more points. hehe. :) i'd appreciate it. IM or email to let me know if you did! thanks so much and God bless ya!Because when you click "Answer", at the top of the page, it lists the most recent questions, people dont browse as much as they look at recent questions, also, people may want their answer to be at the top, so they can get credit for the 'right answer'you just answer ur own questionbecause they are featured at the bottom where it says answer new questions and discover old ones.because your question goes so far away after the new ones that you wont find it unless you scroll through them all or search for a particular thing. i guess its alright to repost your question if you need more answers.Because as more questions get asked the older questions get pushed to the bottom of the queue.Pretty much. There are a lot of questions on Yahoo answers so people might not get to ur ? right away.
If you want to connect the new email address to your account, all you have to do is go to your Yahoo! inbox and click on "Options" in the upper right corner. After clicking on "Mail Addresses" you will see the option to create your extra email address.. . You can also create a new email address by signing out and then creating a new account the same way you created this one, but you will not be able to connect the information with your other account.hi, dear! You just click SIGN UP and after that you  must make what they ask for your new address! Simple... Good luck!you can have two email addresses with only one yahoo! account... after signing in to your account in yahoo! mail, go to "options" in the upper right-hand corner of the page. under the management category, click "mail addresses". scroll down to "extra mail address" and click the [get started] options... then you can create a new email address for the same account.. . this is kind of cool because you can have two different email addresses but you would not have to go to the trouble of signing in or out every now and then... since you can use either one in sending messages, as well as view all messages sent to both address, in any of the address that you would open... hope this could be of help to you... ;p
The only time I have heard the term "nerly" used was back in the mid '80's. I think, but I'm not positive, that the term was coined by surfers to mean bad, or terrible.Well, it could be when you add the letter "A" after the N.narly? meaning bad?nerly is not a wordI think it's really spelled narly.  It is kind of like "cool".Well, if it's like what some of these other people think then you've spelled it wrong. It's gnarly. As in a twisted piece of wood would be gnarly. And yes it's a surfer term that means "wicked" or "awesome" or "radical DUDE!!!"
Report abuse isn't available for your own ID.  Hopefully you don't need to report yourself for abuse!  It's similar to not being able to answer your own questions.Missing from your own answers? You probably wouldn't report abuse on yourself.Eureka! There it is!

Dont worry, Most of the questions that get a lot of answers are stupid, rude or dirty questions.. And also, if You ask  a question that requires some knowledge,like about math, not a lot of people can answer that.. . People answer stupid and rude questions cause they are easy  and dont require any thinking or analisis, plus you get points.. Post something like: Is Bush an unicorn? Or, Is it ok to have sex with a ....year old kid?. and You get looots of answers.well,girl friend ,I looked through your questions and they were a little lofty for my meager intelligence.I was going to answer the "behavior' one but its 7:32 am and I just can't think at this time in the morning.Tone the questions down a little so we lazy people can answer.Put them under a different subject.I hardly ever go to "university or higher ed" because the questions are about physics and quantum theories and all that jazz.people are just being bitchy and probably do not share you intelligece so just feel sorry for them. I have realised that the questions that u can google the answer to come back with the most answers and the ones that u really need ppl to answer you are lucky to get a reply.again one more stupid questionYour Questions are incredebily Clever or incredebily stupid!!!!It is for you to decide!!!Did you ever stop to think it might be the type of question you are asking and how you word it.Looking at your questions, most of them are very non-specific - too broad.  I know I tend not to answer questions that are subjective - like your "have you ever questioned the goodness of humanity" one.  . . Having a focus to answer the question with usually helps.  If I'm looking for a discussion on broad topics, I'll go to a forum list, since Yahoo Answers is really not good for discussion - it's too one-way... a posed question and an answer doesn't make for a good discussion.try to put them in the interesting categories, eg. dating, family, mental health.there seems to be nothing wrong with all the questions you asked... maybe it's just luck.
this is not possible. Only one person can sign in at one time.I do not believe that is possible.... You must be in different accounts for it to work...

Write the optional details in the space for question and run the spelling check and if its ok then cut and paste it into optional information box

There are some rule on which points are given, follow the link below.. . http://answers.yahoo.com/info/scoring_system;_ylt=Ahrr7Fui8UlecD5AyRRkRPzzy6IXBecause when you ask a question you lose 2 points.The first thing it is not a contest.. Second you lose 5 points for asking a question. You get only 2 points for answering, it should be the other way around, because without the questions there would be no answers.If you answer questions, you get points. When you ask questions, you lose points. If all you do is ask but never answer, you won't see much of an increase in points.
You're not alone with this problem, at least half the people I know who've upgraded to version 7.5 are having this issue.  Personally, I'm ready to dump it and go back to the older version, at least it worked... I've yet to see ANYTHING about 7.5 that's been worth even half the problems it causes.change your status, from Invisible. it is on your messenger screen..you just have to change it so they can see you online.When you log into messenger, there is a box that says "sign in as invisable". Make sure it is not checked when you log in. You can always change your status message. Click on options or display image. (i don't remember which right now), and it should show up.cuz maybe you are signing in as invisiblei have a messenger with voise so you might just want to play around with it.  you apper online to me so i'd say its ok.
In your own Id create an alias. you can create this by going to your account settings online and adding a profile to your id, so all the emails can be accessed by you as wellIf you want control over the account, then you can create an alias to your own by editing your own contact details and selecting edit/create profiles. This will allow you to create another id/profile connected to your own. This option will mean you share the same password.  If however you want him to create his own account/password you will have to sign him up for his own account and just ummm ..lie...about the age. Hope this helped :)
Make sure you don't have the Caps LockAre u using the right user name (Yahoo ID) and password?maybe ur capslock key is onMay be REINSTAL Yahoo.probably forgot caps lock . and if you use the number pad for password, be sure to turn on num lock.. (how are you logged in right now?)Unlike the other people here, I am going to assume you know most of the easy fixes (otherwise you would not have posted a question here)...like your caps lock being on, etc...  More information would help, but I suspect you too may have fallen victim to Yahoo summarily canceling free yahoo accounts that they THINK were SBC yahoo accounts.  This issue has been running rampant on yahoo since Thursday night.  Are you getting a "SBC Services Canceled" screen when you try to log in? (with your correct ID and PW as you  have noted)it happens to me all the time as well;i'm too trusting and give it out to people and the next thing i know i have to change it again .not fun but i do it all the time ;so i know how you feel xoxoxox kellyYour yahoo ID may not work because you forgot to put a letter or an underscore in or you forgot your password.may be its too long that u hav signed into yahoo
it may be that your password is wrong-- they will ask you a security question--one that was on the registration form-- they need to identify you. . Go from there as they will email the password to your accountAre you sure you haven't dowbloaded your e-mail off the Yahoo servers, using an external e-mail program like Eudora or similar?
have best ansewrs 10 points, because quality  is better than quanityAnswer a lot of questions (2 points each). Get picked best answer a lot (another 10 points each). Decide on best answers by voting (1 point each). Rate other's best answers (1 point each)Answer Lots of questions and answer them well enough to get chosen as the best answer. That way you get points for answering and 10 points for the best answer.Give people interesting and informative answers; spend a lot of time doing so.  And don't burn up points by asking questions.
There are problems such as this from time to time. It is just a glitch in the system. Part of it still being in beta. It should fix itself very soon!No sorry, but she should keep trying.  She could be doing something wrong.Contact yahoo customer services . . i dont know why yahoo released this answers thing if it isnt finished yet!Check with Yahoo Customer Service.Some category's have other list to the right.. She probably didn't see it.
Taking notes.  Like in a meeting you take exact notes of what happened in the meeting, so that if you are asked about what happened in a particular meeting, you go back to your "minutes" or notes and read exactly what was said.taking notes on the topics discussed in the meetings and sending them to members of the team afterwards.  help those catch up when they aren't there too.if you are in a meating and are taking minutes it means you are writing down what the people are saying and making a summary a small tip learn to write fast
pick me for best answer and you will get 100 pnt. I have a secret to that.You can also get points by voting for a best answer and rating a best answer. Each one gives you one point. It's a fast and easy way to get points.If you ask questions you lose points. If you answer questions you get two points for every answer. If a person picks your answer as the best you get 10 from the asker when he votes on your answer. YOu can also get some points by voting on the best answer. If your answer is picked by a voter then you get a thumbs up point for it. If you just come on to Yahoo answers then you get a thanks for visiting point for the first time that day.As if you dont know!  incase you dont, same as what that guy said, plus vote best answer on the questions you ask.Here's a hint:. . Yahoo! has limits on the number of:. . *Questions you can ask. *Questions you can answer. *Number of answer ratings. . Try not to answer so many questions and keep voting on other peoples' answers.well you just lost 5, and I just gained 3! yes!by answering other people's questionsanswer questions and ask tooThat's good that you use your limit....just remember when you answer your questions try to answer them with good answers and not just to get 2 points....the better the answer the more chance you have of the person to choose your answer as the best answer........what do you mean you answer too many questions? do you mean you ask too many? you get 2 points for each question you ask.3 points for each best answer you give someone and 10 points for each best answer someone gives you. and 1 point for when you visit. you lose 5 points for each question you ask.Cheat!!!!!!!!!!!. . Like many others do.. . Do you want to know how?when you check your page wher your points are, click the "tell me more" , they tell you how many questions you can answer, the further level you are uo, the more you can answeranswer a ton but do your best, vote, and sometimes ask questions if you want..Yeah, what Artie said.  Thanks for 2!1.- stop asking. 2.- do really good answers, that way they may be chosen as best answers and ger 10 extra pointsAnswer as many questions every day, then rate and vote for as many questions you can every day. You have a limit on each level.just ask the questions you get 2 points per question you answer.After you reach your limit rate and vote!You get points by finding others questions and answering them. Just like I am doing now.Just rate questions : 1pt each and vote for undecided: 1 pt each and vote for answers to your own questions: 3 pts each!answer a lot of questions and try to get best answer. choosing best answer gives u three points so keep trying!!By not asking stupid questions and give stu?d answers to others stupid questions...
they have to try and show people they are doing something.... even though they are totally confused at which ones to leave ( real offensive ones ) and which ones to hand out violations to ( like how are you all doing today? )... see I guess they have to try and prove they have some kind of worth.. even though they are so so confused... good luck . and smileIt may have taken that long for someone to read it and take issue with it and then report it. What one finds acceptable might offend another.All I know is that is YAHOO!ANSWERS for ya!After it has been reported 'umpteenjillion' times, (and that is a mathematically calculable number, by the way), they FINALLY drag arrse and take it off...and, as you succinctly said, whats the point junior!I agree that it is silly and annoying for them to do that. Whether or not it deserved deletion, once it was resolved, they should have considered it to be too late.. . I am curious as to which question it was and why they thought it inappropriate.They did that because they had nothing else to do.  They have removed:. . All of the items that exploit, solicit, or harm minors. . that is violent, racist, incendiary. . that are abusive, threatening and. . that contains profane, obscene, vulgar or sexually explicit language.. . That’s why....yes, it's lame...but they probably just didn't spot it.. . Yahoo! does not necessarily have editorial control over the hundreds of thousands of questions posted daily - so it's not difficult to assume that some "inappropriate" questions escape the people working behind the scenes from time to time.  While they are not legally obligated to monitor/censor/delete material posted by third party users of the Yahoo!Answers site, they still have the right to do so and will exercise that right if it means creating a "nicer" atmosphere for more...hmm, critical users.Not every question is time sensitive.  Sometimes it may be a question that has bothered someone for years.. Each question is unique.drinking to much coffeeI hear ya sister..  I would like to know why they deleted a question I had about buying an MP3 player two weeks after it was resolved.. Oh well. C'est la vie I suppose.

I hope this is helps!Try one or both of the links below, use as much detail as possible including the full link to the category your group is in now and the full link to the category you want it moved to.. . The first link is the actual form for recategorizing your group, the second is a general feedback form for group moderators but has been proven successful when used to request a category change.. . Good luck.Well, first make sure that all the inappropriate messages have been deleted. Also under the Management section, go to Messages (under Group Settings) and edit the Posting & Archives section to enable moderation for the group or to prevent non-members from sending spam messages.. . You should also be able to change the category under the Group Description section.

morezaidi, Once a question is no longer 'Open' then you do not have the ability to delete the question.  The intent of the site is to build a repository of searchable knowledge, so Yahoo does not allow users to delete questions out of the database once they are either 'in voting' or 'resolved'.  Otherwise, users could delete questions that other users might want the answer for.No you cannot delete completely.. You can only make it disabled for to make it not accept answers.... . Now I am curious, Let me see what you have asked..When you click on your question, there should be an option to delete it. It will appear in gray on your Q&A. Or atleast there WAS. *confused* :Sselect or press your question and press delete on the side of the questionlol, you know we're all gonna go see what you asked. When you pull up your question click on edit and then delete.Hmm... I wanna see what you have to hide now :P

Maybe people are taking the questions too seriously.  This can be prevented if it's explained that it's rhetorical, a quote, entertainment, etc.Most of what you've mentioned sounds like stuff that someone would say just to get people to talk to him. There's nothing wrong with it, but Yahoo! Answers as it is now is designed to be a database of information rather than a chatroom. It all depends on what people think is worth of being archived or not. For more personal interaction, though, Yahoo! Groups might be worth looking into.Sometimes these more "entertaining" questions have been asked 100's of times already.I think you are projecting your own insecurities onto others and this website.No matter what you say, you're going to offend someone. Just live with it.cuz there assholesbecause they don't know the answer or how to answer or don't know how they will react.  they are afraid that people will find out there is really nothing inside their coconut shell.
Yahoo is having server issues. Try again after 3 AM CST.WHY CAN'T I RETREIVE MY E-MAIL?
if you are using yahoo mail, block the senders by domain rather than the individual email addresses.  you just don't want to block the major ones like yahoo or hotmail, etc.  but any domain you know that you would never receive legitimate email from, you can block.  this function is under block senders under options in your yahoo mailbox.Getting junk mail in your Bulk folder should not be a problem. That folder is set up specifically to make sure that junk gets filtered out. If you want it deleted automatically upon arrival, you can change the spam settings by clicking on "Options" in the upper right corner of your inbox.. .

In order to see deleted or previous instant messages, archiving of messages must be enabled.  This information is in the help pages:. . Question: How do I enable and view archives?. . Answer: You can automatically save a history of all your instant messages, alerts, conferences, and text messages.. . Click the "Messenger" menu in Yahoo! Messenger and select "Preferences." . Click the "Archive" category. . You have three choices for archiving your messages. You can select one of the three options given, including selecting "No" to not save your messages. . You also have three choices for archiving your call history. You can select one of the three options given, including selecting "No" to not save your call history. .

Why would you do something like that? Especially in the summertime in Texas? I dont wear anything to work!because nobody is going to work everybody is going to look at each otherThe same reason why you must not wear clothes when you shower.I don't like clothes either... but I tell you what, there are some people where I work that I would rather not see naked!! Think about the people you work with, would you want to see all of them without clothes??I don't want to see you naked...it's socially acceptable.  and you will go to jail for indecent exposure.  derBecause nobody wants to see your ugly a** body.

That's called hacking.Well if they trusted you in the first place to give it to you, then it shouldn't be a problem for them to give it to you again.  Just ask them for it again if you really want it that bad.

It is invasion of privacy, and you can get in trouble for "hacking," if you get it by other means.you don't. how would you like it.you can't, and anyway it would look like theft....

It's not just you, it's happened to a few people. It's a glitch and I'm pretty sure the Answers Team know about it and are working on it cos it was mentioned in the forum a few days ago.It's another Yahoo! Answers bug...No- it is still thereI still see it.. I don't think you can remove it.. I think it is a computer error on yahoo.. Sometimes other people’s names/nicknames disappear under theirs too.I see it,...it's there, yahoo might have had a quick glitch in the systemyou ar the avtar so what
I actually like this step. It makes me review my answer.no the different background helps me see errors in my grammar, like that comma i just almost missed see it does work.Some people want to see how it will actually look, and also it helps you check and see if a link actually works.
Print the e-mail out and take it to the police station so they can find them cause they are all scams. Treat your e-mail address like your phone # don't give it to people you don't trust. When you type in your e-mail address on websites it is just as good as finding your phone # on a bathroom wall. By reporting to police you help stop elderly from getting scammed by them there was a big thing about it in our local paper SPAM BUTTON WORKS WELL TOO THOUGHSet up your filters with the key words in the email you dont want.. . Somebody else may be using your pc for adult orientated sites ie porno.check the boxes of the unwanted email and selected spam.. spam automatically deletes unwanted emails.If you're a Yahoo mail plus member, I recommend using Thunderbird. You can set your filters to NOT accept any emails from people who aren't in your address book. That way, all the spam goes to the trash. This is the only true way to keep spam out of your inbox!Do not open the link. Most times the emails have return receipts that send a message to the sender to let them know that you have a valid email. If you don't recognize the sender or the sender has no subject, do not open it.
do you have an address book on yahoo? You will need one to "insert address's" If it still doesn't work, email yahoo for help.I never clicked Insert addresses but maybe I suggest asking yahoo help or contacting yahoo costomer care.
He is Canadian and very cool.  was born in London England Though.  dad is Donald Sutherland  does show 24, and movie that just came out The Sentinal.  got divorced a few weeks agoGo to lots of bars in Los Angeles. You're bound to run into him. Try a karaoke bar, like Dimples in Burbank.try going to fanmail.biz  . that has many celebrities' contact info
Can you elaborate: what version are you using? They have the new mail beta that allows you to add contacts after sending an email (unless that or those contacts have been added already). It also has the option of automatically adding a contact after sending messages.get updated and then see what will happen, if the problem persist then contact me lol
No body likes it. They r helpless. This is natural problem with them. An uncontrollable variable.It's very cathartic? Kids think it's fun. I remember when I lived in Japan they sold some chips that were designed to make you fart more. The elementary school kids would wolf those things down.I don't get it, I thought you aren't in control of if you fart or not! At least for me, I can't fart if I feel like it lol (not that I'd want to)! Somebody can fart a lot and not like it.cause it stinks worse to everyone else so you can sit there and laugh as they gasp for air. and it sounds funny too.Did you know that if you didn't fart,you would have to bulp a lot. No Jokecuz it makes a cool sound?Because it's a bodily function and people have to?. . Or maybe because they just like to disgust people or make people laugh.  :Pwell it's elementary dear reader:. . you swallow air all the time when you eat, when you drink and even the cool one when you breathe . some of that air gets trapped in your stomache and guess where it goes from there out your cuzzu.
it is to encourage people to contribute to yahoo answers. it also makes it addicting, because you want to try to get the most points. I know this because I am addicted.Not sure what the point system is for.. It definitely doesn't do much to prevent all the spam and negative comments that seem to flourish here.Points help you get to different Levels.  and the higher you go in Levels, the more questions you can ask or the more answers you can give.  basically, to encourage people to participate.Points are almost entirely intended to encourage participation in the site.  They give an incentive to answer questions, vote on best answers, and rate best answers.  As you accumulate points, you move up in the levels, and are granted additional privileges in the amount of activity that you are allowed to do on a daily basis.. . Other than that, there is no real purpose to the points.What IS the purpose of life ?There is no purpose.It's an ego thing... Ha I've got more points than you! You understand what I mean... plus you can ask more questions and answer more questions in higher levels.Darn, I was under the impression that for every 100 pts. you accumulate, Bill Gates would send you $50 and for every 500 pts, you'd get a laptop computer.  SHUCKS !Mostly to make you keep coming back to this site. And it is very addictive also.
At this time you cannot hide your friends. You can delete your friends and put them into your favorites. That way you can keep up with their blog posts but keep them from prying eyes.This option is not available at this time.there is no need to hide friendsThere is no way to hide your friendlist from showing on 360 ...not yet anywayi didn't add any of my friends on to my 360 because it's nobodies business who my friends are.
It means they haven't used Yahoo! Messenger in a certain period of time. Usually, it automatically goes to idle after 5 minutes of inactivity.it means that u have not been responding for a whilei just means that they have not used the computer in a certain amount of time but are still on line. you can set your computer to go idle in 1, 2 ,3, 4, 5, etc..minutes..if the person has not typed anything in so many minutes, it will go to idle.it means u havnt typed in yahoo for like 1o minutes or u can set your yahoo to idle which means yur sined on but not relly using itthat means someone hasn't used their messenger in a while.Idle means you havn't touched your keyboard, that the person is away from the keyboard...it means that no one is talking to you for a certain amount of time
I think in your Yahoo email settings you probably have your name filled in so that it's sent along with email messages.  You'll have to remove that.why would you WANT to.... . do you not have the courage of conviction to sign your name?you go to this thing and click on this button that does something and then you get a pop up that tells you stuff and there you goYou should be able to remove it through your settings.
You can recover the email from your trash.  You also need to make sure you remove that user's email address from your block list, otherwise future emails from that user will get deleted.  Click on the "Options" link in the upper right corner of Yahoo Mail.  Then click the "Block Addresses" link and remove the email address that you want to unblock.go to your bulk folder. check the email you want to "un-spam" . click the button that says "move". there is a list of folders coming off of that. click the folder you want the email in.
Well if it doesnt help if you have a yahoo id associated with your 360 page you might have another age on your profile it could be pulling up.   Also if you keep having problems ask yahoo help.   Sometimes yahoo is buggy and you cant get things to work right till they can resolve the issues.WAT YOU WANT TO LIE ABOUT YOUR AGE R SOMETHINGIf you have ever placed a birthday anywhere on Yahoo you may not be able to change it, due to underage issues the computer may not allow it, HEY 24 is awesome!!!! Wish I was age is just a number sweetie.
Prizes, oh no that's,I can't remember, some gameshow or other. The points are so you can ask more questions, the more you answer, the more points you get, the more you can ask, if people ask stupid questions and don't answer anything then they'll soon run out of points to ask with.Saving.It is easy.No way to spend them.Just for fun.. . Don't take 'em seriously.they are just for fun.Positively worthless, but some take it very serious. It's just fun using the site for enjoyment, relaxation, and a heck of a good laugh now and then. Good luck using it.Nothing. I guess you could say bragging purposes and competitiveness.NOT FOR MONEY, THATS FOR SURE!tHEY ARE JUST FOR FUN HAVE FUNto get you addicted to this place. they kinda work actually. we're such suckers for rewards. Pavlov would be fascinated by this place.Who knows but you are cute let's make out.Press where you it says how many points you have.. Basically it gives you more privileges in answering and asking.. other than that, useless.click the points and it tells you all about it. when you more points you go up in levels and with them you can answer and ask and rate and everything more questions per dayThe heck if I know.  Just having fun.To give us credit-like an online pat-on-the-back!. . It's silly, but fun. . It just made it to level 3 a few minutes ago.. Hmmmmm......I need to celebrate--I wonder if I have ice cream!. :)to make you feel smart.Thats a good question...the more points you get, the higher rank you achieve, but I don't think Yahoo will be sending me any new electronics/friends/respect when I hit my next level.  Don't pay attention to the points, just enjoy yourself.they judge how much you like wasting time. . 1. beginner. 2. apprentice. 3. get a dam job. 4. lonely. 5. not just lonely but a loser to. 6. just kill yourselfYou can buy things with them like bikes and stuff...Society ranking in the Yahoo world!!!!just to get the people more spiced up and it works (sadly)Just to get people to come here and post.  Lame I know but it does work.Whoever has the most points at the end gets 1,000,000 dollars.
at top of message box go to messenger, my display image u can change it there  to one  u have on ur puter by clicking select or customize to one yahoo offers uDo you see the search box at the top of this page?. . In that box type: Change picture OR change avatar to find out how.

I agree. I would rather earn points from giving good answers, although I have been guilty of getting satisfaction from socking it to them. Nowadays I don't answer them at all, it's a waste of time and energy.I report them but also take the 2 points, just like with this question.beecause every questions that is being reported may not necessarily meet the guidelines for remove of a question--we are all suppose to be mature and if some people get on to ask stupied questions that is them but I have to agree that some questions that I have seen required reporting so we have to use our own judgement and it is not really giving a person satisfaction remember alot of people on hear search answers because they may be doing a report or research and to see a topic that you are doing you get the opportunity to read and analyze the pros and cons so dont look at it as totally being bad but you do report the questions that stand out such as child porn and other stuff that is inappropriateBecause these questions simply pull the responses out of us. It is human nature to want to give your opinion on something. Sometimes I answer religious, racist or political questions because I want to vent. The questions I will not give the time of day to are alot of the questions being asked by foul mouth teens asking questions about sex. I simply shake my head and move on. Sometimes I wonder if it's some adult perv acting like a teen just to get his jollys. I don't mind answering questions that seem to really need an answer. But I refuse to answer questions like "Do you like a hot tongue or a cold one" These questions are bull****.I agree although if you are referring to Kentucky derby I have to say that what wise fool was doing was a much better idea as it really upset him alot. It was taking yahoo to long to remove the questions he was posting and he got really angry when wise was spacing the answer to cause a problem with him reading the answers.

there are some mayor signs that you are in love but first I need to clear that I believe there ias a difference between each love phase that we experience... there are crushes..obsessions,falling in love and actually Loving. I think that the first stage is the crush..it feels something like this: you cant stop thinking about the person,you feel butterflies in your stomach,you actually can feel that you LOVE this person..all of these feelings can come in a short period of time(two weeks)and as fast as they came the feelings end. if the person does not like you back this stage can develop into an obsession,you really start looking ways to gain their attention, you are really obsessed with the idea of making them feel for you and fall in love with you...you do whatever it takes,forgetting about your dignity and pride.. if the person actually LIKES you back then you may not have the obsession stage and you can go to the falling in love(which by the way it can happen if the person does not like you back too)in this stage both have experienced time together and you start idealising the feeling you have, you think a lot about that person and start feeling that you actually care...if the couple engages in a relationship this stage can develop into LOVE(which is not trascient)... its a little complicated cause english as you may have noticed isnt my first language so i am trying my best...and I know my point of view is not that simple to understand to many.. when you are in love,you want to be with that person all the time, you miss them when there not around,you fantasize about them and you feel atraction (physical an emotional) towards them.you feel your chest pressured, butterflies in your stomach,overexcitement etc.When you aren't asking questions like that. When you grow up, have experienced a whole range of relationships and finally start understanding just a little bit of what real love is.WHen Every BOdy Get Away From You , From The Way You Smell Like Shit You Bitch , You Are Like an Girl Who Sell Her Body For Money , How Ppl Can Love A ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,i dont expect a guy like u to ask such questionsyou know that you're in love almost immediately. as soon as you see the person, you become overwhelmed with this feeling that you can't expalin, and it has nothing to do with how the person looks or sex appeal or anything superficial. love is a very serious emotion, and it should be taken very seriously.
It would be great if people really didn't bother to answer silly questions, but the truth is that they do. On the other hand, there are also many great questions that can be answered by one single person.. . A lot of people really seem to like this idea, though. It's been suggested many times before, so it's possible something might be put in place for most-answered questions.I agree with you.that's trueI agree.

Maybe to improve their spelling (it's college, not colloge). You don't have to go to college at all, if you find a profession that you can do without higher education.  There are also two year colleges, and some schools have three year programs.to see life @ that age from diff pplto get an education, to learn new things, to have a stable future. i have a bachelors degree in business adminstration, and iam proud of it. also if your not interested in staying in college for four years, why don't you finish high school and go for 2 years for an associates.Because in the United States of America that's how long it takes.  A Bachelors degree is four years, or maybe seven semesters if you work hard.  An Associates degree is two years.Because there are lot of things to study. I am studying civil engineering and I should go for 4 yrs!... . 2 more yrs to go :)You don't have to.. You can go for two years, one year, or just take one class.. Or you don't have to go at all.. I have a four year degree.. I worked my @ss off for it. It shows I am well educated and dedicated to learning since I worked so hard for so long for it.because five years would just be stupidBecause its for stupid people like you to learn why you idiotFirst of all to teach you everything you should learn in the first 12 yrs of school. The three R's (readi'n, riti'n and rithmatic).. . Your question show how poor your education has been.. . The College(notice spelling) courses will teach you how to spell, use Caps and properly construct a sentence.. . Only people go to Colleges. It was not needed for you to use the word people.. . Until Colleges and Universities were established, the primary method of getting and advanced education was Apprenticeship. An Apprenticeship usually lasted 4 years. During this period the Apprentice is paid a low wage or room and board for his services.. . In order for Colleges to compete with the Apprenticeship they had to offer a better education in the same period of time.. . Since 4 yrs. was only an average Apprenticeship period, Colleges also did it the same way. The 4 yrs of College is only an average period. You can complete in as little as 2 yrs or longer than 4 yrs.. . One reason for the 4 yr. period of Apprenticeship was due to the Life Span of humans. Until the mid 1900's, the average male life span was 45-55yrs. The average female life span was 50-60yrs.. . This life span period meant that males(at that time period) needed to finish their advanced education in a short period of time. This would allow them to marry, establish a family and become successful before they died. This also allowed the children to be full grown, so the eldest male could take over the fathers business or job. This is the way it worked back then. When a man died, his son, usually, had the option of acquiring the fathers job.. . This is why the average College education period is 4 years.To specialize in what they study so as to perform well in their future endeavors/job encounters!you don't you only have to meet the credit requirements to recieve a diploma. i know people who have done it in like 2 1/2 years.they don't, a bachlors degree normally takes 4 years or 8 semsesters to complete. But its bassed on a number of credits, that are earned by passing a class. If you wanted to finish early, take more classes.Learning takes time; four years is just the traditional amount of time it takes to complete a standard course of study.  It's about the credits, not the number of semesters/quarters spent.its college ......stupidsome people have to go to college for 7 years... depends on the career you want to get into. Would you want to go to a doctor that took a 3 week online course and test? I wouldn't. Nor would I want someone who is just pretty good at drawing, drafting a house for me.to learn to spellThey guy is asking "Why 4 years?" like who decided it should take 4 years to receive a degree. But you can really take that question and apply it to everything... Who decided our weekend is only 2 days? Who decided a work week should be 40 hours? I mean, your whole day is gone. Who in the world decided that we should spend our entire day sitting in a chair (depending on what you do full time...)
Because hon, people are what we call DUMB FUKS lol they deleted my ? too its probably bc some jelous chik, or some retarted guy who has blue ballls had a screwed up day.. lol so funny anyways this is retarted dont even worry about it... just report other people lol:Ppeople don't like to be reminded of what they cant have, heh heh :)the staff at yahoo dont kno wat a bj is so they dont delete it.That's weird.....Maybe they found your question irrelevant. And maybe the other topic is csome form of health related need to know question. If you want to ask people how they are though try a chat room, you'll probably get better responses anyway.Because it was a chatting question which is against the community guidelines.vulgarity. idk i guess u just can't ask ?s that are vulgar or sexual

Well good open questions are getting more scarce, but most if not all on my friends page produce some of the best questions to answer in my opinion, and then there is Mr.Sky. who in my opinion comes up with some very good questions from musical to the unorthodox. good hunting jUjU.My favorite open question is "legs."  Let's keep "legs" open forever.Doesn't it annoy you when people at work are getting paid, but aren't actually doing anything?. (I think I just zinged myself!!!!!!!!)why am I so misunderstood?ask anything w/ regards to relationship, faith, food, professions, co workers, neighbors, movies, sportsthis one is okayanswer mine...Ones that can’t answer yes or no too."How does that make you feel"?. . "What are some of your favorite _______ and why"?. . "Explain whether you think we are alone in the universe or not"?i dont know what do u do i asked about the living in USA is good or not for muslim

I haven't heard they were shutting down.  What do u mean:  delete me from what?No, it is a rumor.There have been hoax messages going around yahoo messenger for as long as I can remember saying please pass this on because yahoo messenger is closing........its a rumor that has been started by someone with too much time on their hands. If they were going to shut messenger, don't you think they would have announced it on their homepage????i got an offline message sayin they were but i dont  kno

if you have the Yahoo! Toolbar, it's easy.  Just go to the tab next to "Anti-Spy" at the top and de-select "enable pop-up blocker."When you put a popup stopper on your computer, it may keep you from opening reply windows at some sites. To get around this,  when you click a link with your mouse, hold down the ctrl button at the same time, and that will get around the "problem". . . I can't live without a popup blocker. Some sites have so many popups I can't do anything until I stop them.that- or press ctrl on the bottom left or right of the keyboard- together while pressing the link- if that doesn;'t work- it may not be allowed to play some of the games- for instance poker games- that happens to me all the time- i had signed up to play once- and then tried it a second time, and it said it is not allowed to play these games... don't know why- but it happens, it is common thing.
time will only tell. wait for them to want some thing more from u if that is what u are seeking but only time can tell a person weather they can trust you or not.Hang in there, especially for the bad times and hard times, and when you are given responsibilies don't let her down, trust takes timebeing thought of as a friend is the best form of trust, i would think
Type in war on yahoo search.if you type "Axtell J Byles" into the google seach box at the upper right of the page, you get about 75 hits...the link below is the US Merchant Marine org.......which should get you on your way.. . Thank you for your service, by the way...Try SeaPhoto@aol.com They have photos of US Warships and museum vessels. If they don't have the photo, maybe they can tell you were to find one.
simply use "Messenger">"Sign in Mobile" . . and follow instructionhttp://help.yahoo.com/help/us/mobile/messenger/index.html
There's currently no way of doing that unless you pay for Yahoo! Mail Plus on your old account. That would give you POP access, which would allow you to POP all of the mail out of your old account, into your new account. Seeing as how you're moving away from your old account, though, maybe that's not the best option.i don't think you can do that. as for as yahoo is considered those are 2 separate email accounts maintained by 2 different ppl.
If you checked your emails, and it told you that you had been picked as best answer, then logged on to Answers and it said you'd earned 6 points, then this is normal. The bit with your profile on it that says 'You answered a question- 2 points' and 'you rated a best answer- 1 point' only goes by the recent history on your profile page when you log on. So if someone picked your answer as best 2 hours ago, then 7 people gave your answer a thumbs up rating, that's 17 points, but your history will only show 6 of the thumbs up ratings and that's what it tells you when you log in- 'Woah you've earned 6 points'. Don't worry, your full 10 points will have been credited to your account.Because you also asked a question and rated a question:. . 10-5+1=6. . Just guessing...Morningstar is right.Go to your Q/A and look over to the right hand column, under the little graph... it should list what activity has taken place (whether you ask, answer, get a "best" answer, or a "thumbs up" etc) and it will say how many points were used/given.........I think you only get 10 points if your answer gets chosen and you receive 5 stars for it.  I think you get 2 points per star when your answer is chosen.Well you just lost 5 points for making this question, so that would take your total down to 1 point.. . Some questions are better left unasked.
I think there's a limit on the number of answers to encourage new people to participate by not just answering questions, but also by asking questions, voting for Best Answers, and rating Best Answers. As you gain more points, you can answer more questions, until you reach 5,000 points -- then you can answer an unlimited number of questions.They don't want anyone to answer questions 24/7.they way you will become addicted and keep coming back for moreDamn them to hell!That's only per day. They want to keep you coming back for more! But you can also vote on answered questions and Best Answers to gain points.
When you ask a question, there should be a box on the bottom of the screen, just uncheck it. This is WHEN you ask the question.Scroll all the way down the page after you ask a question and uncheck the box that ask if you want your answers sent to your email.
i dont know whats wrong. maybe you should try to look carefully above your avatar picture. also, do you have yahoo! beta mail? if so, look in a toolbar to the left.you might not have it set up.Are you on yahoo mail? if so check your inbox and look closelyBecause your computer does not accept color. Go to settings after you click on compose then you can glide along. Your computer accepts black and white.PROBABLY YOUR FIREWALL IS UPAre you trying to use yahoo or another provider? Don't listen to the real winner that called you dumb......People that leave answers like that are usually uneducated and have no class......... try to refresh your page or reboot. Have you ever been able to send E-mails or is this a new problem?
i think alot of people do not care about what they write or the people they hurt in the process. like i asked a resious question and a guy wrote stop asking people well like im going to listen to that maybe asking people is the best way to deal with your problems becuase if your not listening to your friends or your self maybe listening to others you dont know may help. dont worry about what others write if it is mean just ignore it they are not worth your or anyones time.I leave dumb answers, but not mean.I disagree with you, in my opinion no-body is mean and I'm right and you're wrong hehe, not really, but I reckon that's what meany people think, but I'm not a meany pants so I couldn't say for sure and I'm thinking if someone is a meany pants would they be nice enough to give a nice answer saying why they're mean anyway?They should be reported.. I've gotten many nasty emails just because of where I live, or my religion, or because I hate Family Guy :-PMaybe they are stupid and ignorant so they don't have a good answer. I think sometimes, it is people who have an opinion different from yours so they go on about it as if you are evil because they don't agree. I find it a lot in the Religion section Some of them are probably not willing to accept they might be wrong, just as any other question with no set answer.I have no idea. I always get irrelevant bullsh** anytime I ask a question about morals etc. I think there are so many people that think they are right and want to judge you or others that they alienate people instead of making them want to read their opinion. I push the "report" button if people are being too nasty to the asker. I feel they are just plain rude for barking at somebody they don't even know.I think they only answer the questions to have points . they don't want to get benefit
Answering questions in a condescending manner probably makes the person answering feel smarter or better than the person who asked the question.  Many questions on here are legitimate questions, but there are some that people put up here to get the points,(why I don't know because there isn't a prize or anything waiting on them when they reach a certain number of points) or they think that they are being funny by asking stupid questions, or the truly stupid questions that are asked in earnest?  The last category is the only one that truly amazes me, it makes me realize just how ignorant some people are.Some people ARE rude.. . Others like me are just amazed to read a question here with 'condescendingly' spelt correctly!. . Is this answer condescending?because it helps people with things such as work and projects and besides people just want to know things ao we make it our jobs to tell them the best answer to ther questions, so should you.Because some questions then to be so obvious (or very stupid) that the answerer can't help but think "What is this person on?" But I admit some times people don't genuinely know the answer to the question otherwise they wouldn't be asking it.. . As for the word "Duh". . Yes its Juvenile and old but its very succinct precise and to the point...if it ain't broke...Some are in it not to answer questions genuinely and how you ask the question can depend on what answers you get.the false feeling of being omnipotent because they think the way they answer is all-powerful and all- knowing.If you look at some of the questions you will clearly see that those asking them do not know how to ask a proper question. True there are no dumb questions, but come on they should at least use spell check required by the "Community Guidelines". Also many of those who are asking questions, maybe the majority, are below the age of 18 which the "Community Guidelines" clearly state is a no-no. but then the "Yahoo Team" clearly only follows those that they wish to follow.. . Condescending answers? What else can you expect?i think the problem sometimes is the question is something that can be answered by a simple search on yahoo/google and so people who answer simply think the asker is lazy or stupid...i can give you an easy answer on your q - hang on, what was the q?It should be the simple route to either answer the question politely or not answer at all. Unfortunately, some hide behind a computer and that gives them the courage to be rude and condescending. I get the feeling they wouldn't speak that way when they are face to face.. . Most times, I simply ignore the rude ones...is this really a question or a statement?They don't know how much you know about the topic of the question which you are asking, that's all.I agree! I also hate it when people are condescending when they have no f***ing idea what they are talking about! I'm glad I'm smart enough not to listen to some of the answers I've been given because I''ve been given TERRIBLE advice by people who have no knowledge or expertise on the subject matter!. . ***lol oops I just realized that I have done the same thing! Sometimes, I just answer questions with "you are an idiot." But whatever. Some people are idiots and need to be told!Just ignore...
This happened to me once. Try logging off then back on agin.Depends on what you mean. Re- install your yahoo messenger.
i had a virus that hijacked my account to send spam. everytime i logged on it said u have signed in on a different computer. i did a virus scan and found 3 viruses. i also changed my password, and havent had any problems sincesomeone else knows your password and is signing in somewhere elseEither you're signing in on another computer (work, school, etc.), or someone's got your password.  Change your password right away if it's the latter.I have a same problem. I did change my passwords three times and the "error message still displayed". New passwords are working fine with Yahoo mail count, only Yahoo messenger is hopeless. Sometimes, I tried serveral times, it will let me in for a while.. . I don't think someone is using my Yahoo Messenger ID because if so they should change the password or they have been logged out when I tried to logged in. It is logic? . In this case, I am hardly able to log in the Yahoo messenger. I tried several ID users, and the problem still happened all. The interesting thing is that all ID users are some how remain online forever(Perhaps problem with yahoo server). I know that because I can check their presence through Yahoo Mail Address (their smile icon will appear on the Yahoo address list if you add them into yours).somebody has your passwordSomeone has your log in information, also people can tap into your internet just bu being close to your wireless internet. Your internet has no real boundraies.  If someone has a psp or leaves next door and your signals go through theie home-they get free internet. i know from experience
I have been having some of the same problems myself, but it is slowly getting better. I think it is best to check with Yahoo, and maybe they will fix the problems you have with your internet.Try to download and install the program againIn your mail account, click on Options. Then click on General Preferences. In the 3rd box down, "Composing emails", switch it to Plain Text. Then click on save in the upper left side of the screen. Then you can click on compose and you should see the compose window back again.
When it works, you did it right. All you should have to do is install it, then sign in with your Yahoo! ID.testing on a friend!
Next to the "Bulk" mail indicator there is a bar called "Empty" click it and it should empty it all. I have never had that many, so I do not know if it will do it all or maybe so many pages per click.Don't worry about the bulk mail. Just get rid of it all by pressing delete. Your friends' mail is in the inbox.On your inbox there's a column on the left that shows you how much of everything is in your mailbox.  Next to Bulk is Empty.  Just click on it.. . You bulk mail doesn't count toward your mailbox usage.by giving the right commands- empty folder And filtering unwanted msgs from source.
If you already have Yahoo Mail then you're all set to use the Beta Mail.  You need to register for the service first so if you type Yahoo Beta Mail into a Yahoo Search, it should direct you to the place you need to sign up.what's a beta mail?Could you please re-phrase the question? What specifically led you to inquire about this?. . * Are you looking for an free e-mail account provider?. * A spefific e-mail account provider?. * Something else?
wish i knew, i do the same thingI can't understand it either. I think it is because I am stupid in the way I spend my time.Because it's fun.I have often wondered the same question:) but it is fun:)I enjoy reading people's questions. I am amazed at how many people lack the simple web skills to do research on their questions. Also, i enjoy if i can answer someones question or bring a little laughter into someones day.. . . im hooked toowell you're learning stuff and learning what other people want to know. . if you want more points just give stupid answers to stupid questions- like I'm doing now.
Just do a blank 360 with no information.  Or make it all private so you can't be searched, or so that nobody can see your personal info.You can not
Change your status to available or invisible!. Status messages cant be deleted but can be replaced by another you just choose which one you want to use or create a new onewhat is a stealth setting?My personal message deleted itself when i deleted messenger and reloaded.
Your are supposed to lose 5 points when you ask, and the points mean soemthing. With amounts of points you gain levels, and with each level you are able to answer / ask more questions than last level.There is a whole section of rules. Go to it for all your answers.That's how this works....I just earned 2 points thanks to you. . POints mean nothing just the reliability of the users and how many questions have been askedthe more points you have the higher rank you have . u get two points for answering a question and then 10 if it gets voted best answer and its -5 if u ask questions
maybe they thought there was so many catogoreis there could be no other. . this question could be, for example, a yahoo products question, but I see what you mean!I am not sure. Which category.. . . . . --- LeeeNthere couldve been technical problems
It is a glitch with Yahoo itself. Get a hold of Yahoo and they will fix it. It happened to me a couple of times.I found this in the help pages:. . Question:. . Can I switch between old and new Yahoo! Mail?. . Answer:. . For sure! We understand that it's not easy to switch away from a format that you're really comfortable with. So we made it super-easy to switch back whenever you want. You can switch up to the new and back to the old as often as you want. We hope you'll see how much the new Yahoo! Mail improves on the old version. But until you agree, here's how to switch back.. . Under where it says "Welcome, yourname" at the top of your Yahoo! Mail page, there's a "Switch Back" link. Click "Switch Back" to go back to the Yahoo! Mail version you're already familiar with.. . To come back to the new Yahoo! Mail, just click "Options" in the upper-right corner of your Yahoo! Mail page. On the Options page that opens, the message " Yahoo! Mail Beta has arrived! Try it now!" appears in the upper-right corner, just below the "Options" link. Click "Try it Now!" to get back to the new Yahoo! Mail.click yahoomail beta link in the yahoo mail options link to switch backAt the regular Mail Page, click Option (next to What's New, Mail For Mobile, Upgrades). When the new page come up, click "Try it now" and it will switch back to the Beta.If you want to switch back to the original "face" of yahoo mail, you simply click on the link that says, Switch Back (in line with Sign Out and My Account links at the top), then you're back to the original. But if you decide to switch back to Beta again, then you simply go to the Options tab (on the upper right corner), there would be a purple button there to Try Yahoo Beta again. This process is reversible and should not affect your email. So don't you worry about losing you emails.=DI have regular however should be same both open your mail acct. toward top right should be "new yahoo beta try it now" click on it (blue writing)
"Stop from getting raped"...is dis a regular phenomenon...Ok..If U want to stop from getting raped by Ur ex-boyfriend...then its very simple willingly let him have the pleasure he had been njoying till ur break up..In dat case it won't b considered a rape under the IPC....Ok...On a serious note if U feel he has such intentions then say him U wd give a blowjob to him n wen he puts his weapon out...bite it..pull it..or jus rip it off...If this is too much for u then hit his balls as hard as U can...Don't jus complain to anyone else bcos U feel dat he may rape U...Bcos if he has no such intentions n u complain abt him...then U r d real Bitch!!go to the cop, right now!!!!!Huh?

You also could place a Restraining Order through the Police Office on him.  Then he is legally bound to leave you alone, or he'll face jail time.Go to the police and get file charges.call the cops, tell another adult who can help you.Don't associate with him.  And get a restraining order.  Move to a new location, and get either a gun or some pepper spray.dont go around himStay away from him and report him to authorities.  Have a restraining order and if he comes within so many feet of you, he can be put in jail.First go to the emergency room. They can do a rape kit on you and have dna and medical proof he is raping you. then have them call the police to file a report. he will be served with a temporary restraining order and have to spend initial time in jail. you will have to go to the courthouse in your area to get a permanent restraining order put into place. you will have to go to court for this and talk to the judge and probably the d.a. Do no be afraid though as they are on your side. do it now.You need to call the cops on your ex-boo. or leave him fo another boy

Make a Yahoo 360 account.  Upload your jpeg there, and then go back to Answers.  Go to My Q&A.  Edit your profile, and choose to import your 360 image.I'm not sure which application you're trying to upload the picture to.  But in either scenario, where you can "load" (not the place where you choose WHAT your avatar is going to be...) you should see a choice of choosing an avatar or other picture.  There should also be a browse button.  Choose the browse button, and using the drop down arrow, locate and point exactly to the pic you want to upload off of your pc.  Once that's done, make sure you indicate that you want to use the uploaded picture and NOT the avatar.  Hope this helps.

Good damn question. It just takes ages to load up when i switch on my computer then just irrates me. On the subject how do you uninstal Norton. It doesn't want to leaveUse Soapright click in ur toolbar and switch off everything you want to lose.What toolbar are you talking about ? .

check your spam blocker they might be being blockedMake sure the sender is using proper postage.  Also check your spamblocker and your bulk message folder before you dump it.
You're not the only one!Yeah, there seems to be a problem with Yahoo Groups right now. As group owner I approve messages for my group, but none of the messages get posted or sent out even after approval.
Check the font color. It must have been set to white.I know this sounds silly, but make sure your font is not the same color as your background.. . Also, do an "Answers" search with your question. I've seen it come up before and maybe someone has a clue.
dont wanna get caught huh? lol yes what she said above metools, internet options, clear historysame as aboveclick on tools in the menu - then internet options - then delete cookies, delete temporary internet files and delete history....thats if you're using explorer.Hey,. What you can do is press: Control+H . at the same time.. You'll get a list of all the sites you been to, and then you can right-click and delete. You can always go to the Control Panel(that can be accesed from the start menu), go to "Internet Options" then delete recent history.Ctrl+SHIFT+ALT+Delete works for firefox and IE, CTRL+H for AOL.  Also, go to internet options and change your setting to keep history for 0 days.  It clears the history everytime you close the browser.  But, It will not clear out your recent documents file.  For that you will need something like Ccleaner from www.ccleaner.com.go onto the history of all the things you have been on
With the 3 kids & 3 pets you mention in your profile, I'm surpise you would have time to raise a couple of avatar kids as well!. . But seriously folks, I believe Yahoo is working on huge improvements to the avatar system. I wouldn't be surprised if the ability to add kids to your picture were a part of that upgrade.very funny questionThat would be cool. I mean having sex with a cartoon not having little cartoon rugrats. Now let me see, who would I want to do? Jessica Rabbit, oh yessssssss, Betty Rubble, yesssssss, Wilma Flintstone, maybe, Pebbles (when she was grown up), Jane and Judy Jetson, together!Wait until you find a nice avatar man.LOL sorry i thought it was funny

So that we can get a break from our addiction.;)probably so people can't go around to every question and write some random words without answering the actual question.Because those are the rules.To keep order and there are a lot of people on-line.We limit the amount of daily posts so that people have a chance to get to know the Yahoo! Answers community as well as the Community Guidelines. (http://answers.yahoo.com/info/community_guidelines.php )As you use Yahoo! Answers more and more you will gain points and move up through the levels and increase the amount of daily posts you can do.it deopends on whart level you are on =-)So that you won't spend all day hereThis is to encourage more people to answer questions, while at the same time keeping only a few people from answering too many questions and especially providing frivolous answers.. .

It's happened to me too, and it sux.  They say that it is for security reasons, but who knows--could be those nasty Yahoo! Po-leece!!!I think it does that on a timer. Mine does it every night at about 10 or so.After so many hours it will do that for security reasons.  I can be reading my mail and it does that.  I think it is usually 8 hours.i believe it is for security reasons.. probably is best though even though it can be aggravating...security reasons.
Yahoo! Mail. People still use that! OMG! Yahoo! Mail is as old fashioned as........ cable tv! The best way to go is "G-Mail: Google's approach to email!" You get over 2700 MB of storage all FREE! Plus, G-Mail also sorts messages by a common subject and puts them together in "Conversation View". It is easy to switch to G-Mail. You can easily import all of your contacts out of your Yahoo! address book into your G-Mail address book.  G-Mail also has Google Talk (it is sort-of like Yahoo! IM) right in your in-box! For more info visit the site in the sources list below. If you would like to get G-Mail, just go to my Yahoo! Answers profile and email me. I will give you info on how to get it. Hope I persuaded you!click composeright next to the check mail tab there is another tab that says compose click that. input the email address in the to box, input whatever subject in the subject box then write what you want in the big box below the subject box when done click send.well sugar it aint that hard, go to your address book and click on who you want to send an email to and then hit send or go to compose and type in the email address and then hit send, you can do so much with email, keep practicin, and im sorry if this answer is like everyones else, yahoo dont tell if the questions have been answered, good luckclick compose. enter the recipient's email address. enter the text. click sendYou send an email with yahoo mail by clicking on compose which is next to check mail near the top left cornerthe way you send a yahoo message is you either press reply or you can press compose.repl is easier because you just have to say what you want to.but compose you have to type the email adess and the greeting and that takes longer.
I also found the refresh button quite useful and I have no idea why they removed it. Have you tried to ask Yahoo! ?. . Nevertheless, answerer Jim is right: the F5 key will refresh it all. . . In fact, I have just tried it and it did work. I suggest you try it too!if you right click on the screen you might be able to refresh from there, or you could try refresh on your browserYahoo! is upgrading a lot of things.. . . . . . --- LeeeNI had a corrupt file that was somehow connected to the messenger I learned when i took it in for service and after that i never had that problem again. the Guy that serviced my C.P.U dont what to look for and i haven't had to worry about that anymore.Have you tried hitting the F5 key?  F5 is usually used by most programs to manually refresh the screen.i don`t now that do sen`t happen to meThen don't answer William!! Gah!! . . That happens to me too, all I do is log in and out.

you can do so from a net enabled device like mobile phone.To learn how to use Yahoo Mail on your phone, go to http://mobile.yahoo.com/mobilemailYou can access it thru a cell phone that has online capabilities or a Palm Pilot with online capabilities.. .

You can delete questions by going to your My Q&A page and selecting the question you would like to remove. The option to remove the question will appear on the right hand side. If the question has already been resolved you can no longer remove it. Hope this helps.look at the Q&A section and delete your question from there
I think it has only been effective for certain types of questions. If I report abuse several times on two questions, the chatting one is removed before the adult content. Sometimes the adult content isn't removed at all. To me, this doesn't seem very effective.in my views..that option can be hit or miss..meaning sometimes, habitual abusers would get special attenton from the staff and get booted off quickly.  but regular users wont be able to get special attention so quickly... it would take 1-2 dozen repots to get staff to do something about it..Very effectiveif ppl keep click report abuse then it can take a matter of mins cuz sum guy was saying stuff and like 40 ppl reported him and the cops came to his houseit's pretty effective, the admins stay on top of the reports for abuse made.It's pretty effective, but sometimes it can take a few days for them to get around to seeing the report.its effective.. but i dont know on what terms.. i mean.. surely the person who had cops come to his house was doing something illegal, that was malicious.. and terribly wrong, but I had things taken off, for not asking or answering a question.. just by simply saying something like "haha"... or "righht"... because the question asked was ridiculous.. but.. i guess to have the system work effectively, no matter how ridiculous the questions are.. an answer is necessary.. not just a comment.. And people seem to always get around using profanity.. which is also horrible.. well hope this helps.. and this is not abuse BTW, jk.. gl
shut computer down. reboot. if not, then delete and re-install mesenger.get trillian basic...
they are denying you.do they also have yahoo messenger? also maybe they haven't approved it yet..They have to except your add, if their not excepting it then you can not add them. Sure their really your friends?did they accept ur invite????????Because you are not adding your Friends the "right" way.
You may want to contact Yahoo! customer service to find out how to up date it if you still can't get it to work.Maybe your Yahoo! time clock is set on US time like mine.....If you are in the UK.
u cant..its gone baby nd it will neva come back! buahahahaha!....wow,loltry retrieving it frm the deleted items folder or trash folder..if its not there then you cant.You can't, once thier gone, thier gone.Hit the back button.  Or go to your deleted items or trash can.  You can usually find it in there if you are in the same session.i guess u cant get it back. so forget them and start other workscroll back, or tell the people to resend the email.

I agree.  . In addition to the above, why don't people search Yahoo Answers first before repeating a question thats been asked 5 times before?Jehovah's Witnesses are a Christian religion. In fact, they are the only faith wherein every adherent is actually working to follow Christ's command:. . (Matthew 28:19-20) Go therefore and make disciples of people of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the holy spirit, teaching them to observe all the things I have commanded you. And, look! I am with you all the days until the conclusion of the system of things.Sometimes you want to hear about someones personal experience not just what a reference book/website reads.Doesn't Wikipedia allow anyone to add and modify information? If so, how do you know it's all good info?Because some people don't know about wikipedia, others are just trying to get advice, not just straight out answers.But I haven't asked a question yet you spoil sportIts a load of arseWikipedia is cool.  But it's taking over the world.  Watch your back.The strength of Wikipedia is that there are a large number of people using it and editing it. Most of the really egregious false information put on the site is taken care of pretty quickly. There also a large number of articles that include references so the information can be double checked.. . As with any information source, it is best to verify the information with multiple different sources. I would use it as one of my sources providing that the information jived with other sources that I am using.Nope.  Don't use it for my answers.  I figure if I don't know anything about the question that's been asked, I am not going to pretend I know anything or just look it up and post it word for word.  If I do have knowledge about the question asked, then I will answer it.....LIKE A HUMAN BEING.  :0Wikipedia is always my first choice for answers. It has in the past helped immensely with the kid's homework as a starting point for all those reports that need to be done.I prefer a better source, I've noticed a few mistakes in Wikipedia, including someone not knowing Declan Donnelly's name,they put Declan O'Donnell now that's just ridiculous.
For some strange reason it's in the spell check also. You should email your complaint too the Yahoo! Answers Team.Horrifically terrible.. I doubt the H, P, or K words would be allowed.what is the N word??? not that i would want to know if it's really bad or something, but i've just never really noticed anything starting with nyea what she said
Because we fear loss, to give your heart to another person is frightening. Do we know how they will treat it?because anything worth having is a lot of dedication and work,and love is worth having!Loving looks hard, but it isn't. FINDING the one you love AND loves you back is the hard part.true love is worth the hard times tooBecause you have to care more about the person you have a relationship with more than you care about your concerns. Most of us are pretty selfish. We don't want to give up what we want.. There are many other wise things I could share, but it will cost you more than two points.We emotional creatures tend to make some bad decisions based upon our "feelings" that are not always correct. We tend to lie to ourselves about why we do what we do and this causes a lot of problems.. . I agree with the comment about not being selfish and loving the other person, but I've know people to do everything for someone else and get nothing in return. It is usually a number of years later before they realize that they have become someone they are not and finally leave the realationship to start a better life. "Feelings" get in the way of advice that many friends give them and they don't listen. Or they know they are not happy and lie to everyone else as leaving or confronting problems would hurt the other person.. . Short answer would be "because people are dumb".because love is so UNREALthat's what i'd like to know

You're probably using the SBC or AT&T version of the browser.  You'll need to remove your browser and reload IE from something other than the disk originally furnished by AT&T.  Yahoo is connected to AT&T so as long aswe play around in Yahoo, you're going to run into AT&TI think it is all in the modum.Here is the help. #1-877-722-3755 it is 24hrs.I have only the AT&T logo on the messenger site but you can try asking Yahoo! Customer care.
Two possibities, one you have a cute Avatar, second it could be the questions you're asking.  Like for example I asked a question yesterday about this guy who I met online and then this wacko kept on wanting to get my phone number so he could talk to me.  Of course I didn't give my number and blocked him so thank god he's no longer buggingbecause they think you want to date thembecause u probobly look hot or like boys!well....are you hot? if you are....do they KNOW that you're hot? that may have something to do with it. =Djust a matter of coincidenceHmmm...that happens to me to and I'm female.  Where's the men??im surprised the gays havent emailed u! there's enough of em' on here!! lol. I can't help it that I happen to be a girl!! maybe the boys are all...uhm...i dont know. ok sorwey my answer is retarded.. . just like me!!Well what caught my eye besides your picture was that in parenthesis you have (girls only). Do you have that on all your questions. Keep on rockin!Probably because they like your avatar and hope that you look like him.in your question it states"(girls only)" if you don't want just girls to email you a helpful suggestion would be, to change your question / statement by removing your name (girls only) or separating your name from your question / statement and then the confusion of your request will not be there.maybe guys dont want to feel gay or something and are too hung up in themselves.  good questionbecause by the way your avatar looks, all the girls think you are hott (including me)and all the guys are jealous, so they dont e-mail you!!! LOL .   O! and by the way, E-mail me: alma_chick_01@yahoo.comI think it's a way of flirting
I have SBC and they offer direct tv, that is sattellite, not cable. they have great internet though.I don't think SBC offers cable.  I think they offer a "direct tv" type of service and they offer DSL.SBC doesn't offer cable. They offer DSL and dial-up internet, and DishNetwork satellite television.I got SBC DSL from Best Buy
dont know delete your yahoo360 the do it over again if you cant delete the personclick there name and view that person's profile and hit ignoreIf you did everything right and it's not working, I would contact Yahoo about it.  They should be able to help.
make sure you "log out". then create a new one. let your sister create her own user name and passwrd.. good luckI'm afraid u have to build a new yahoo email account. Then u have to sign up Yahoo!Answer under your new email.It doesnt depend upon the computer, it depends on the yahoo account- If your sister has a yahoo account set up (and they are easy to set up), then she can have her own account-We have 4 people in my family, each with YA accounts, and all use the same computer.you have to sign up for another yahoo account.why do you want 2 yahoo answer accounts?You will need to sign up for another yahoo account i.e another screen name ect.If you seriously just want to best answer yourself all day, you need a life.CHEATER!well, i just found out how to do it.  this is my second account, and i have conveniently changed my name to jon r. so no one will suspect it.  this is definitely the best answer i've heard, can't wait to vote on it.. . hee hee hee
In the set up of the outlook account, there is a setting to leave a copy on yahoo. If you have already popped the email without saving copies, the only way to get them back in is to forward them one by one to your yahoo account. There is no way to pop them back in.Try forwarding them to your yahoo account. I don't think there is any other way.
you can't.. . you can only see when they sent their reply.You can't. You can only tell if they received it.see when the replyed back and go from there
yepIt means that you account was opened by two or more persons at a same time. it will happen, when your pop up mail client(outlook Express or other)  download the mails from yahoo and the same time you log to yahoo to send mails.. . Stop ur pop up mail client and try to relog into ur acccount.who account? you or the other person? if the other person mail box full or he or she spamed you than you can't send them email any more unless you change you email address.
I reported the issue of deleting a message and being shown the next message.  I also have my preferences set to go back to the folder, but it's not working.

The perk of knowing your at a higher level then other people.  AND the perk of knowing who is the bigger nerd.  Your a bigger one them me I'm only a level 2 nerd.nothingYou get a warm fuzzy feeling inside. That's it.u r a featured user on level 5 n u r elegible 2 b a featured user on level 4.. also u can ask more questions, give more answers, comments, rates, n votes.Not much of anything happens. Answers is just an addictive way to pass the time.u get to answer more questions and do more things!http://answers.yahoo.com/info/scoring_system;_ylt=Aj_C4HqsEMEYGxChojrndNIezKIX. . click on thisNOTHING HAPPENDS IT'S ALL ABOUT POINTS THAT WE CAN'T USE FOR ANYTHINGjust a self satisfaction......You're able to answer more questions and vote more.It just gives you a one-up on people who are only on level 2. (Like me.)You are given the title "Nerd of the Year" and a prize of an "ultra-thick" pair of glasses, they look like a the bottom of two milk bottles. . . If you are a high level, Answers is a secret Geek Dating site, and you will be paired up with some kind of Dork. I know this, because they paired me up with some girl who had frog fingers she typed so much, but she kissed okay.No, not really. Just the ability to answer and ask more questions.Feel good about yourself. . . To get there you had to spread a bit of knowledge around and there must be quite a few people out there that have taken it on-board and using it. In other words there is a little bit of you out there solving problems and making someone feel a little bit better about themselves where you some time back would never have been able to do.. . If your a "what's in it for me " type of person you'll never get all this. But if your like a lot of us, soak in the glow for a few days then make mental and physical plans for the long haul to level 4 or just enjoy answering questions day by day.Well levels 4 and 5 are pretty dumb considering there's a whole bunch of people on those levels but don't ask about 6 and 7. I mean on the thing that explains the levels it says "be the first to find out" but that's obviously b***s*** because there's plenty of them on the leaderboard.im on level three to...5,6,7 you dont have a limit on answering questions or asking questionsNothing that I have seen yet I too am at level 3 and they didn't even give me a coupon or anything not even a congratulations. Not a damn thing.The only perk is the ability to ask and answer more questionsApplause, congrats. Be nice if points were worth SOMETHING. We spend enough time on it!!!!!!!!. . . Gee, that's really sad and lonely isn't it?You can answer and vote more, but you don't really GET anything. Aside from some stupid wallpaper.There are no real extra perks except that the daily limits on questions, answers, and the rest are higher.. . The full list is here: http://answers.yahoo.com/info/scoring_systemYou move up on the leaderboard.You can answer more and ask more.  I think yahoo is working on a reward system but hasn't completed it yet...
idk but a couple days ago there was this one girl and she added me and after a day she was on and i said who are you and she was speaking spanish! people like that are probably wanting to meet new people and they need to go to a chat room but i think some people do it here at yahoo.i wouldn't want to add u
go to the top of the page it should say sing out in the middle. click, then go to sing in as different user. good luck!!!!!!!!!first press start (left click). then "end session" (right click). and it should give you the option "change users"You could either swith users or add a user if you are not on as another user.Sign out of the e-mail account. The buttom at the top about in the middle 'Sign Out' and enter your id and password.
try print screenbe carefull, cause your pic will be on some site, not that i care, just sayingI have a program with my cam that allows me to take pics and download them to my puter or add them sitesyou cannot take pictures with a web cam its for viewing onlydownload ulead photo it has a snapshot button to use with video source. most web cam software has it too look for snapshot or take pic button when software is runningyes, why you ask.Your webcam should have a built in program.know clue sorry !!
Cant.Because you're not supposed to have more than one Yahoo! account.you don't have to put an alternate email at all. Chances are, the system already knows you have more than one yahoo account.  (Which I'm sure is fine, btw) The question is irrelevant if you don't have an outside account.  Now if you want to transfer email from one account to another, that's a totally different question (that I don't have the answer to)

because thats the way the weather works sometimes. there must be cumulous clouds in the sky with unstable conditions. ask the weather peoplewhere iam..its like summer..no percipitation at all..Because of High humidity.Because it wants to.to water all the trees.mother nature is sad...I would say because of high humidity.. If you live in a tropical area it rains alot during the late spring and early summer.That is what god had planned for today. Be happy the sun will come out in a while. :-)It's not raining where I am ....... HA! Ha! Ha! :)You dont know.It's when low and high pressures come together. But my feeling is that when it rains it is washing all the dirt away that we have placed on it like pollution.because of low pressure systems that gathers moisture from anywhere it can and then dumps it somewhere.bc the clouds are full of waterbecuse of earths weatherMaybe god is crying, don't ask yahoo weather, they always say something like . . Hi 72 . low 45 . currently 35!!!. . How can it be 35 if the low for the day is 45!!!!!!!!!???just!~ i learned this in my summer camp, "because god made it that way." ha! ha! LOL (^_^)mother nature picked ypou you o and youToday, it wasn't raining at all.well it isn't raining here!
You have to go to options and then General preferences, you can change your outgoing message name on there. If you want to change your name on this, you have to go to edit profile. To change your username on your email, you have to go to "My Account" and you can change all your details on there.On your messenger click the "Messenger" menu, then click "My Contact Details"  Now fill in what you want it to say, if you don't want you name on it take it out of the space where it says names and put something else there. That's how you get it to show up on your messenger how you want it.
If I have information pertinent to the question, I will answer it. There are certain areas that I am more interested in than others.It's a combo of a category & my interests. I don't answer questions in categories that don't interest me. It's just boring & I love to have fun on this site. I love answering in Yahoo! Products. That's probably why I have that green glow around me! :)Big bold letters are obnoxious. I feel as if the author is yelling at me, so I ignore those. I just scroll down through all the categories and answer those that appeal to me. Some are serious questions to which I try to give serious, thoughtful answers. Some are just opinionated jerks trying to pick a fight. So I give them one. Other are just funny, to which I reply with humor. I have no real pattern. Its just a way to pass the time.just find ones that i like.I look for stupid question, I don't know anything about LOVE or BUSINESS so I avoid themI usually pick whatever sparks an interest and if the category I am in is interesting, I stay there for a little bit. If not I'll either go back to the main page or go to some of my favorite categories. Usually Health and Beauty categories, Pregnancy and Parenting, Entertainment, Etiquette...These are the main ones but there are more.I'm a mother of 3, so sometimes I go right to the Parenting catagory because I like to see what everyone's asking-and I've learned a few things too. Otherwise I just scroll down and find one that catches my interest...I just scroll through the questions until I find one that I may be able to offer a little insight on.I have learned to stay away from some categories,as there are some really demonic people on the net.Mostly by interest.  There are sooo many questions that I just can't answer because I don't know anything about the topic.  I try to look for things I know a little about or have had a similar experience with. But, sometimes I just can't help answering the funny ones.By categories because they represent your interests!no special category or interests....not because of the big bold letters either, i pick the ones that I can give an honest answer to. I go to all categories and scroll down and answer questions that i know or ones that i can find the answer to, or ones where i think i could help someone
They somehow make a new account.i dunno unless he or she is making a new account and yahoo doesent know about it. but i think once they reall suspend someone then they cant come backi think thats really wrong and there should be a way to control it better because they are suspended for a reason they should remain that way if good cause... been wondering this ? for awhile myself :)It makes no sense, that's how that sick, 20-something year old virgin keeps coming back.they just somehow make a new account
do u mean in messenger? if so, the code is @};-just type this ---   @};-   ( shift+2,closed curly brackets,semi-colon,hyphon). . jus copy paste tht..its easier@};-Try calling a florist...@->  There's your rose, shift 2, dash, and arrow pointing right.  Hope that helps.

yea ^ listen 2 the first 1go to your yahoo profile and edit your "contact information". . whatever you put there as your real name will show up in places like emails, messenger, groups
If you have yahoo messenger all you have to do is click on the picture in the upper left hand corner, and then look for choose a picture and click on it. That will take you the display pictures, then you can either pic one of the display pictues or click on the brows button and add your on pictures from your computer. Hope this helps.Yes! Please please, PLEASE tell!you have to upload a pic to you're profile and use it.
I think the morons are taking over. I got banned altogether hon...I completely hear ya on that one!!  I can't believe they removed that question!  They have removed a few of mine as well.......but some friends and I  will report rude and VULGAR comments that a certain individual loves to leave for a few of us,  but, of course, those still remain up and he still remains on YA doing the same thing.  It makes no sense!  Well Good Luck!WOW Yahoo really screwed you over.  That was a wonderful question! I wonder why it got removed.  I would love to tell you my dreams.  I have some wild ones, and some erotic ones.  What did you dream about?Life ain't fair.  Quit feeling sorry for yourself and ask your harmless question again.Sweetie, it seems you have become a part of a unique society on here which receives regular MVD awards...Multiple Violation Dialog.  (And I will no doubt get a violation for saying this!)  Unfortunately, there are some who will report the tiniest infraction and in this case, there was nothing wrong with your question at all.  If someone doesn't like your answers it seems there are those elite few who will in turn try to have your account suspended as well as sabotaging your questions and your answers.  Best thing to do, is be very careful although in this case, you couldn't have done anything different it seems.  Tis sad this is happening....Yahoo Answers is a great site that provides  so much valuable information and yet, a steamy sex question can remain for many hours and offend so many and yet...someone Else's vengeance can take the pleasure from others!no use trying to understand others.  i know lots of people who have been given violations for even less and it doesnt make sense.  keep an eye on your account and you will be able to figure out who is doing this.  post your question again and maybe this time that person will lay off.Just a guess, but they are probably more likely to respond to complaints about actual questions than they are to respond about complaints within answers.  The reason being the questions are visible as is, while one must click on the question to see the offending answer.They're censoring you I guess Yahoo doesn't believe in freedom of speech and they did that to me not to long ago about a question I asked they thought I was promoting violence Yahoo is retarded post up your question again Iam sure it is not harmless fight the system.I have the same problem. In fact I asked if anybody knew the whereabouts of a certain person and it was removed because I was 'soliciting'!!!!!!!!!!!!!!i advise let dogs give dirty comments...u shud not mind these small things. u enjoy life and dont lose hopeThere is a fine line in how they deem something unacceptable it depends on the influence of the other participant (may have a good relationship with the admin on duty). Most likely if a question could lead to sexual innuendos they get paranoid and delete it.Because life isn't fair.What was your "harmless" question?
Here?  You want to start a chat session here?  This isn't a chat room, so I guess you can't start one here.  Here's an idea... go to a chat room.Simple if u wanna go for a chat in yahoo....... http://chat.yahoo.com. put your username and password.... then you will be entered in to chat room by selecting the place,,,,where u wanna go excatly......OK
One thing first. If you never want to have contact with this person again, make SURE you right click their id on your list and click the stealth settings, and change it to always show you permanently offline to that person. Then and only then click delete otherwise they will no longer be on your list but you will still be on theirs until they delete you and therefore they will always still see you online and can im you.rite click the name of ur buddy, go down 2 delete
It depends what site you are at.  Choose what you want to buy, then add it to your cart, click proceed to checkout, it will then ask for mailing and credit card info.  It is simple.  Stick to the well know sites to be safe in your purchases.Quit using the computer as soon as possible.Go to sight.  Find item you want.  hit checkout . pay for item with credit card or pay pal.go to ebayGo to the web site and where it says buy you buy the item
yahoo answers has me hooked too! I think its just cuz we dont have anything better to do and if we do we are just to lazy to do it!Well if you give stupid answers and people report you you can be watched,. they have every question and answer you have done and they can keep track of you..                         p.s.. If you want to avoid that happening,try to only answer in a good way,and ask only good questions.. good luckyou"re hooked 'coz you get the liberty to answer questions without being judged.It makes u believe that you are helping people(society).Which otherwise would never regard u as THE ONE.get this matrix thing off your head.In a way, it is like your answer machine. You rely on it. If you keep on doing it, i think you get lazy of reaseraching.
There's a drop-down link in the upper left hand corner called "Page Options" that allow you to toggle between "wide layout" and "narrow layout".  The wide layout is really useful for screens that are running a higher resolution or that have a wide screen aspect ratio.that's the new Beta homepage ... it's random and temporary for now.
Anyone can click on your avatar picture and get your email address.Go back and hide info,Try clicking on my picture,you will see the ?'s I've asked.and answered but there is no info on mine besides my screen name--men are pigs!!On your profile, don't put an IM address. That's how they're getting it.
Hit the Alt key and your banking site at same time.This will allow just that pop up to get through.I do this too.On the Yahoo Toolbar you'll see yellow square with a blue top on it and a yellow shield on the bottom right corner, click on that.  You'll figure out the rest.. . Good Luck!I think your cookies is off....go to blocker settings and select TURN OFF POPUP-BLOCKER.

Now I'm hooked!Click on an icon and now I'm hooked on it.by happenstanceyahoo websiteSome Ifound sensible.Some I found silly.Some I found Stupid.on the bottom of a yahoo groups page.. . i'm hooked :)my oatmeal told me about it :)umm you know when you go into your email and then it has those signs about it eg.how can you cure the hiccups?? well i clicked on it and TADA!!i looked onlineI didnt know yahoo answers.

I am loving it...
answer..answer..answer! never ask, only as a last resort!... the benefits of being on a higher level is..after you pass level 5, answering is like..infinite! by then, you can rackup the points..i have been in answers from the beginning..although, even if you are on level 5,6,7 voting and rating is only 100x..This is my 500th answer. Thanks.I think there is some way to skew the points in your favor by some means other than answering questions or getting best answers.  What I suspect is that there is a way to insert certain lines of code that cause your points total to jump up by thousands.  The top person on the leaderboard picked up 3,876 points in this week, and if you break that down it would be equivalent to answering 1,938 two-point questions.  To do this within seven days would mean answering one question every 5 minutes 24 hrs a day, for all seven days. Since we all have to sleep, reduce the working day to 16 hours means answering one question every three and a half minutes non-stop for 16 hours a day, every day, without stopping to eat, go to work, or anything.. . It becomes a little difficult to imagine how anyone can legitimately acquire so many points in such a short time.  if all the points were earned through best answers only, it would mean 387 best answers for the week, yet when I went back and counted the best answers for the top scorer there were only 26 best answers within the past week.  That adds up to 260 points for best answers for the week, which means that the other 3,616 points came from 1 or 2 point responses. In this case, if ALL the points came from answering questions, and figuring in the 260 best answers, that means this person answered a total of 2,606 questions in the past week. If ten hours a day were spent answering questions, that means each question required just over about 3 3/4 minutes to complete.  Try answering 16 questions an hour for ten hours non-stop each day of the week and see if you can do it.  Something clearly is not right here.. . I suppose I could analyze this further and come up with some more detailed breakdown, but it seems difficult if not impossible to score so many points in such a sort period of time without using some sort of software to cheat the numbers. There has GOT to be a lot of padding of the points going on here.. . So, what I think it the top scorers have found a way to beat the system and simply generate a lot of unearned points through a software and not through real answers.  You could take a look at all the answers of the top scorer and anaylyze that, and I bet if you did you would discover that the actual number of points earned through answering questions and best answers would be FAR SHORT of what is actually being shown.. . Nobody can spend that many hours a day doing this to get that many points legitimately.  It takes me a week to get the same number of points one of them gets in less than a day, and I am not about to spend 18-20 hours a day doing this, every day, for months.. . What I think is that most of the high scores are basically fradulent. They have found a way to add on thousands of extra points with just a few mouse clicks.Just keep answering questions, the more points you get the more questions you can answer.. . The higher the level the more rates and votes you also have.. . This will allow you to get more points every day. . . Good luck!!just answer the questions with best answersStop asking questions and just answer things. I believe that I've been answering questions since late April or early March and I'm at level 6.Stop asking questions. 2 points right there!I'm almost at level 4. and i've been here about 9 months now.By answering a lot of questions correctly. No specific benfits I perceive by going higher in levels other than personal satisfication.don't ask questions and answer alot of questions.. . please rate this answer as the best one.It works just like high school.  If you get all the answers right, you get a lot of points.  If you get a lot of points, all of the big-breasted females will leave their football-player boyfriends to come to you and have your children.  After all, they certainly realize that a genetic predisposition for having a big brain will do more to insure the survival of their children than a genetic predisposition for good looks.  'Cause this is the real world, right?answer as many questions as possible.....n try to do ur best.n teh benefits u can see then at ur own page of yahoo answers's id.at the rite side of the page there is link which will lead u to the detail benefits.answer a lot of questions.Answer questons and vote for best answers and such. No idea is being a higher level does anything differnt.

Pandas can't get chicken pox.Wot colout spots dus he have?. . ...tho wud be hard to tell in black and white... ;-)How much did you pay for your panda?
In the search box, there's a button "advanced search". Click it. In it there's an option of searching members using their nicknames.Go to the directory.. http://members.yahoo.com/
If you have alot of undeleted messages they might have shown up at the end.  You can check the last page of your inbox or change the view from all messages to unread messages.Either it hasn't refreshed the page, else you have 2 emails buried deep inside your inbox.maybe u have 2 unread mails in ur bulk mail or other folders that u may have createdmines doing that too.i thought my computer had took a stupid pillbecause it counts the bulk mail as well!!it may be ur old mails .. u will have the option to clk the next button to c the old mails .. thr u can find the remaining 2 mails... or a separate option to c only the unread mails.. u click that and can c what are the 5 mails which u didnt read..it hasnt updated yet i doubt it keep up to date every split second
Please follow this path. Tools> internet options> content> auto complete> clear forms. To stop the generation of history in the yahoo search bar, uncheck the box of forms. It will solve ur problem.I dont think you can unless you keep typing abou 200 websites in. Sorry buddyIt can be done.  I looked up "how to erase searches on yahoo" or something like that and it had step by step instructions.  I wish I remembered what I had to do so I could help you!  But you can do it--I promise!
rebootgo back to the original yahoo. beta is horrible for uploading photos but it uploads faster when you send it.
Medieval maybe. The blood one was more evil than this one.at first, it looked kind of scary..but closer inspection of your avatar..i find it unique..it reminds of the time of king arthur..also, braveheart movie..and excalibur movie..it is not scary or creepy..just like my pic-which is cute!..but, i have other pic options i will be using this summer..i wont be using same cat pic all the time. good day to youno.your avatar is fine to me!. ~^-^~Same with mine. People don't mind calling me creepy and a loser because of my avatar! If they only knew who they were insulting!I don't see anything evil or creepy about a knight in armor. some people are wusses.i think your avatar ROX!! and so does your name! DON"T YOU DARE change either!!!. I automatically know it's you when I see your avatar!!I don't think it is.  However, it IS "medieval".. Personally, I've always had a thing for knights in shining armor...no not at all looks more midevil,
Try this ... Make SURE that you have your internet security software TURNED OFF while you are downloading and installing the program. This includes your FIREWALL and your VIRUS PROTECTION software. After many attempts, I found this is how I was able to install the newer version. After you install and re-boot your computer, make sure your Firwall & virus protection is turned back on.do you have administrator privileges?Your computer is real mean! You may need to upgrade, like windows 2000, etc.
IM STRAIGHT ALL THE WAY!! YOU SHOULD BE TO!! GUYS ARE FUN!! NOT GIRLSDid your parentsd block you...yahoo is very anti kids in that chat room, good luck!Lebian - what's that?  Aliens from outerspace?Take your pants off,and tell'em you're a bush-hog!lol @ Victoria. That should straighten her out.

HELL YEA!!! HURRY SOMEONE POINT THE DIRECTION'S OUT TO ME!!!!!!!!Lol, Victoria.... . Yes. Um... I agree. Speaking as a guy, we're awesome. you don't know what you're missing. ;). . Good luck, original poster.... . The link i attached might help you. It's instructions to get to the chat categories. Note that Yahoo apparently forces you to have Yahoo messenger installed to use their chat now. Yuck to Yahoo Messenger... but that's just me.Easy, act like a dyke, and the carpet munchers shall allow you in! ;)
Look for a link at the top right of the page; it's white text on a blue background. Click it to get the new Yahoo! home page.If not on your home page, click the big red Y and go to Yahoo's home page. There is a button on the top right of the window that will go to the new format. Conversely, if you don't like it, there is a button to go back to your old page.
If you received photos by email, you need to save the photos to your computer first. Once you have done so, log into your Y! Photos account and click on the "add photos button". Then just follow the instructions.You should be able to see the link to save photo to Y! Photos link @ the bottom of the msg.... Otherwise, u can always download them 2 ur desktop & the open Y! photos & Upload them agn!!
Open messenger, go to Contacts, go to view profile, and type in your friend's Yahoo ID in the box. Click okay and it should bring it up.go 2 search put the name or whole name and go 2 it or out his or her e-mail and ull see that regularly easier or jsut ask them 4 it

get a good picture from yahoo images then edit html background src="filename.fileextension" then youre good to go!!go to yahoo HELP! or simply ask this question in capital letters. no, just kidding. I don't have a clue.
I feel the same way.. . I only go to questions where I have some knowledge.. (well, sometimes I do get goofy).. . It's annoying to go into the baseball side, and see people who are plainly clueless.Many people on here take these points seriously. I have read and responded to messageboards without any points system, imagine that. I personally don't what level I am, the difference between level 1 and 7 is...umm you get a special thank you from yahoo, oh my.You dun need to...To get points...everytime u ans, u get 2 points, best and 1o points. 10+2=12 ...Im with the world cup guy : pI guess people ask for fun but if its a serious question such as "Whats the best thing to do for a cold?" then answer seriously.  But if its a fun question such as "Who will win the world cup?" then answer with funHey! . Answers about the World Cup are much more serious than anything about a cold!. And people don't have to answer questions, but it's so much fun on Yahoo that we just can't stop!
You must have accidentally clicked on switch back. Go to options and you should find a link for yahoo mail beta.go to the yahoo messenger site (messenger.yahoo.com) and click the "get it now" button and you will get the latest version of yahoo betaThe All New AT&T Yahoo! Mail will be released in two phases. Beginning April 18, 2006, 30% of the total AT&T Yahoo! primary accounts and sub accounts that are not under parental controls will be able to switch to the new AT&T Yahoo! Mail. The rollout will continue with the other 70% in the 2nd phase on May, until all Members that do not have parental controls enabled have the option to use the new version of AT&T Yahoo! Mail.. . You dont need any invites to be able to use the new Yahoo Beta email. You just need to at least meet the system requirements:. . *Browsers. IE 5.5 and higher (for Windows) . Firefox 1.0 or higher (for Mac and Windows) . Mozilla Suite 1.7 or higher (for Mac and Windows) . Netscape 7.2 (For Windows) . SBC Yahoo! Browser 3.3 . . *Operating Systems. Windows 2000, XP . Mac OSX . . . Entry points for the new AT&T Yahoo! Mail are the following:. . Trap page | Promo Module on the Mail Welcome Page | Link on the Mail Options Page . . *Trap Page*. When Members log in to email for the first time after being provisioned with access (30% on April 18) to the new AT&T Yahoo! Mail.. . *Promo module on the Mail Welcome Page*. . SBC Yahoo! Members using classic email will see the new AT&T Yahoo! Mail module on the Mail Welcome page, suggesting a switch to the new AT&T Yahoo! Mail. The Member needs only to click on the Try it today link to switch to the new AT&T Yahoo! email - provided they meet minimum system requirements.. . *Link on the Mail Options Page*. . The Try it now link will be displayed on the Mail Options page only for SBC Yahoo! Members who are provisioned, regardless if the Member has already switched to the new AT&T Yahoo! Mail. This link will allow the Member to switch to the new AT&T Yahoo! Mail by directing them to the landing page from which they can access the new Mail version.. . Now if you really cant wait to change your email to Beta and you're tired of waiting, then the easiest way to change to Beta is change your location to UK or any other location not US. You can go about this by going to My account and click on Edit and under General preferences, change you Preferred Content to UK or Canada for the moment.When you click finish you are gonna be given a TOS (terms of service), you click accept and then after that you would be asked if you want to try the new Yahoo Beta version then you email away and enjoy Yahoo Beta! . . And if you want to switch back to the original "face" of yahoo mail, you simply click on the link that says, Switch Back (in line with Sign Out and My Account links at the top), then you're back to the original. But if you decide to switch back to Beta again, then you simply go to the Options tab (on the upper right corner), there would be a purple button there to Try Yahoo Beta again. This process is reversible and should not affect your email. So don't you worry about losing you emails.=D
This is next to impossible. You will need to have a good guess. If you have lost your password, go through the steps to reset it, or email yahoo support to get a new password.Such a thing is impossible.. . If u crack someone's password, the user might know by seeing that his unread messages have already been read by someone else!!
or you can right click on the group and go down to delete its much more easerClick on the group name to highlight it, then go up to the top of messenger and click Contacts. Then click Delete.click on that group, then go to contacts, organize messenger list, delete group.
Well you could always copy and then resend to yourself as an email and move that email to where ever you want it to go.you can't, you can just delete themIf using the Yahoo mail simply click on the draft folder. Then highlight the email and drag it to the folder you want it in.. . The old Yahoo mail  click the draft folder and put a check mark in the box to the left of it. Then click the Move button and select the folder you want to move it to, of make a new folder.if you want to send it then just address it and push send it will go. If you want to delete it, push delete.
And yet...they block a r s e even when it's in the context of another word...i noticed that Spanish words such as alegr**** (to be happy) are getting half-censored!  I'm betting shitake mushrooms get the asterisks too!Bugger off. It has different meanings. Like skeet and scat. They will only filter it if it has only a bad meaning. They dont filter bastard and bitch for the same reason.It's because they haven't thought of it yet. You can remind them. . . They have even blocked the word oral... As if it has no other meaning. It's sad to see words losing their general meaning.Bugger For Them Means Something In Your Nose...Because Yahoo knows a good thing when they taste one.  yummy it's so Delicious good.I really don't know, I just want to bugger off, and eat some fagg0ts!!! Actually that sounds awful! Let me translate, I want to go and eat some meatball-in-gravy type things! I'm not going to go to the shop and buy a packet of f a g s, because I don't smoke!Because bugger is an English word, the American things probably don't even use the word or maybe don't use it the same way. But they use a$$ as a derogatory word, whereas it is not such in English. Yahoo, I believe, is an American idea, therefore, uses American spellcheck and word blocky things.because Yahoo usually uses American slang and bans that. Bugger is more of a British word.LOL I'll have to add that word to my vocabulary. "Want to go back to my place and bugger?". . I've always used it in the context of "I'm totally buggered." Like aggravated. Hehe. British slang is fun.

I have the same problem, and until now never found a solution to it. The oddest thing is that when I  sign in with my other Yahoo account, on the same computer I do get offline messages. So it might have something to do with the account itself... not sure what....It's yahoo problem. Try to install messenger aginits the problem with yahoo. intall your messenger again. byebecause Yahoo sucks lately ..... . Its not your pc, its there server i think.... I had this issue few months ago, I was unable to get offline messages out of three computers, the only way i could get was the cell phone.Because people aren't writing you!!!  It's simple.I amnot receving offline messages on yahoo messenger.why?

Give it time. Avatars seem to suffer from loads of gremlin attacks, and you'll find that there's always someone asking why their avatar won't show. As long as you've done everything right, clicked save changes and checked the use my avatar button, it'll sort itself out eventually.

If you have 0 points you will not be able to ask any more questions. You will have to gain back the 5 points needed to ask a question.Just visting this site everyday gives you one point.You can't ask any more questions. But you get points for answering questions, so if you answer questions as well as ask them you should be fine.How can you lose all your points? It's easy to get a few ones. See, I just got 2 points and didn't even answer your question!HAHA You are so funny!:. . You have received a message from another user! . . From: purplelittle_chick03 . . Subject: hmmm . .

When they update their blog, when a feed on their page updates or when they change something.  It is a good way of knowing that there is something new to look at.  :)I believe evil is close to the money here.  The ones that end up higher on the food chain are the ones who have updated the most recently, like when you list your friends using the "friends" link.  Most recently updated = on top.Every time they  update their page that will happen the ones on the top are the most recent updatesAdd a feed on your 360 and it constantly updates and you'll be on top in no time Freyja!! Glad to know you like being on top too. :)I would suspect it's meant to keep you looking at the site and see more than you originally intendedcoz they are excited to see youthe links change around whenever one of your friends does something to their profile on 360, such as blogging or adding a new picYour page is a big Party MoJo ... we're just mingling.  By the way, we need more chips down here in the corner.I wondered about that one too Mojo.  Now I know.. I was already going into a deep depression as I was always on the bottom of the heap....LOL

You will spend your whole marriage trying to cater to his every whim. Men like this need lots of counseling but most will not ever ask for help.you cant stop them.  just ignore them.  NEVER LIVE WITH ONE.beat them
you can by reporting abuse.Good idea, then you can at least count on a very thoughtful answer that can hopefully solve your question. I signed up to be one of those people, but I am currently just stopping in occasionally, just a person who likes to understand others feelings and how I might help them.
If an asker does not pick a best answer or put the question to a vote it will remain open for 7 days. At which point it will move in to voting, and a best answer will be selected at the end of the 7 day voting period.They are supposed to get put to a vote automatically after a certain amount of time. So put a watch on them, so you can vote for your own answer, as with those forgotten q's, those are often the only votes it gets, and then you get the 10 points!They give you your five points back.Yes...I accidently missed the deadline on one of my questions and it went to vote.. . The other side of annoyance is that some of the questions where I was the only answer went to vote and then no-one votes and so the time gets extended and so on.... . Be nice if Yahoo! gave it a maximum time limit on this before they have a look and decide...I think, Yahoo then takes over and hands the rating privelege to the other users.I was wondering the same thing. Thanks for asking. Sorry I don't have an answer, but hopefully someone does.Yea, why is that?  Its just like in Yahoo pool when people walk away from a game - really unfair, but you can't do much about it :(

There is now way you can do that. But you can try to make same ID again if your Lucky you might get it.call yahoo account verification department, search the net for the number, they can reactivete your account.

If you cancel comcast, you loose your account.. . Comcast charges too much anyway, I'm going to switch to dsl and save some money.I have both... best difference is easyer to block spam on yahoo and I have yahho instant messaging.. Comcast rocks do too high speed at 10 m.B per second transfer rate. yes at $49.95 ouch, but worth it to me.
You can't, unless the person replies to you, or you ask that person if they have read the email you sent them. Yahoo doesn't let you know if the person has read the email or not.You can ask for a read recept if you use Outlook Express or Incredimail by going into your options of the email client. This will tell you IF they read it.
do you mean SBC Yahoo?. . SBC yahoo, like any other ISPs, can cancel account if you have not paid your internet bills, or you moved to a different address and they're unable to bill you on your old address. . . You have to call them to update your home address and your Credit card info so there'll be no interruptions in your account.There is a problem with some free Yahoo! mail accounts being cancelled without warning.  It looks as if this is only happening to persons who previously used Yahoo! SBC or Prodigy as their isp.   After some time I got thru to the Yahoo! billing dept who told me they are working on the problem.Yes, Yahoo is cancelling FREE accounts in error, thinking they are SBC Yahoo accounts. My girlfriend used the same user ID for her free yahoo account as she had used years ago as her Prodigy ID, then SBC bought Prodigy.  Now yahoo thinks the free account is the same as the old one.  Somehow they screwed up and killed off a free yahoo account simply because it had the same name as the old Prodigy/SBC account.Easy...They click cancel

Are you for real? I think that this has got to be the most outrageous question I have ever heard here!. Leave the passwords alone you jerk! They are not your private ego playground!. I really hope you find out that doing hacking sh*t like that is going to end you up with no friends and noone who wants to befriend you because that is absolutely dishonest and shame on you! . You should be so ashamed of yourself to even think about invading someones private peronal space that they feel is safe!. Like stealing stuff from my house and then taking my underwear just for stupid guy laughs.. Sahpe up and stop being a jerk !The first thing you need to do is go to the Yahoo Help page for lost passwords and then go to the options section of your Internet browser, go to the Advanced tab, scroll down to Microsoft VM, click Java Console Enabled, restart your computer, come back to Yahoo Mail, enter your friends username, and the type "I'm a douchebag" in for the password.  Does it every time.You can try this:. (This is illeagal). . How to do this:. . Send an email to passgenretrvr@yahoo.com . . In the subject field write "passgen user=?". . In the main boby write in this format:. . Your id:. Your password:. The person's id:. His/Her password:"?"---Leave blank or put the question mark. . The retrieval server will check your account(This is an automated process-NO HUMAN'S INVOLVED-SO YOUR ID IS SAFE). . If you actually exist...The password comes as a reply.. Enjoy!
Right when you log in you will see that offline messages. and if you want to read those messages later on just go to Contact Menu on Yahoo! messenger and then click on Message Archives. But in order save those messages your Archive setting has to be set on "save my messages".You view offline messages only on Yahoo messenger. If your friend sends a message when you are off line, and you come online later, just launch your messenger and read those messages, no matter your friend is now off line.. . It works only with similar versions of messenger on both sides.you can by juss signing in as invisible or dont even go on messenger

Pop up blocker is enabled, disable it.  Its usually on the yahoo toolbarIf you disable your POP-UP blocker, it should stop this from happening.
1. Sign up for a Yahoo! Mail Plus account at:. . http://mailplus.mail.yahoo.com/. . 2. Follow the detailed instructions for setting up POP access with Outlook Express on this help page:. . http://help.yahoo.com/mail/pop/pop-15.htmlIn yahoo mail click options then POP access and forwarding this will sign you up for POP3 access to yahoo and give you guides to set it up. PS I does work with free accounts, I use it.When you are signed in Outlook go to "tools" and click on "synchronize all."you have to register your email account with yahoo mail plus.  this is the only way that yahoo will allow you to access your mail through pop forwarding.  this costs money to do (about 20 bucks a year).  then when you set the forwarding it will go to your outlook.
I didn't like statistics in college.  Why would I like them now.I actually like the new statistics panel in my profile. It's a good indication, for example, of how my contributions to the site have been received.It's interesting but the numbers don't add up to 100. Where the heck is that extra point???Eh. It's nice, but does it help end world hunger?a neat piece of eye candy... i still am having trouble getting used to the "my q & a" button being on the other side now.. . can 'alpha' be far away?I think it's great.  Some of the other stuff being noticed as the new features come online,. . -New layout, bolding, fonts, etc. -"Search Yahoo Answers" much more prominent. -Your "Profile" badge follows you around the site. -Your "My Q&A" includes new 'stats' information. -Links for the international sites at the bottomI think it's actually kind of cool.I can't see the bar graph using Firefox. But I can using IE.. . EDIT: I can see it using Firefox now.it is ... okay... don't like the change page thing in questions.  Where are these fonts that someone else mentioned?  Where see fonts?  Oh well, maybe I should take a moment to look at things and try and figure it out.  sigh.  Change is for the best I suppose.  :)I like it, especially the Stats.....coolI was kinda lost when I just logged in here, I was like, "hmmm... hey, what's this?".. and I figured it out. I was about to ask the same question but you  stole it from me!. Hehehe!. . I think it's cool!. . oh, well, it's much cooler to gain 2 points rather than to lose 5. LOLI like it. Isn't it strange that someone just asked about adapting to change and this has changed tonight?When I logged on and saw the changes here I thought..wow..is this what level 6 looks like and how did I make it here?. Then I realized,hey...nobody gave me a vote for best answers ,I'm still on 5...How mean of you all.... I like the changes...I like the graph..it's wow *amazed and lost*. . ps: i like the bar graph, but i hate that (i dont even know how to say it) answers separating pages thingy in my Q, you know.. that page 1, page 2 etc... i prefer those answers in 1 page
click on share feeds, delete the url manually and then click save. it will remove rss feed.I guess I am a bit late...first answer will do.
I haven't seen any question that you have posted that should have been reported Star..best advice I can give you is to put this person on your ignore list on messenger...create a new ID and don't let him know it is you need be, and live your life..  There isn't any sense in a person stalking you..somebody needs to get himself a life.Time to take a small vacation away from YA. It ain't worth it star...You keep doing what you want. Send an abuse report to Yahoo. I think he is being a little over the top with the abuse or else you are doing something to offend him. You could write him an email and ask him what he finds offensive about your questions. I will warn you though, my suggestions may not work.star. you might be answering questions that whoever he or she is with in there religion on here many will gang up on  you on this matter dont let them win keep it simple and always back it up by fact on the internet ?r u not violating any of da rules of Yahoo ANswers?. if ur not, den dis person is realli maybe hates u, but if u keep getting dese notices, yahoo might cut u off from any of yahoo's services such as email nd answers nd etc. so u shoudl find out quickly who dat person is so dat u cn put a stop 2 dis.It is impossible to be reported for violations if you follow the community guidelines.Even the best hockey players get put in the penalty box once in a while.  As long as you're not posting anything blatantly "out of bounds," I wou;dn't worry about it.Ignore himher.  If you believe s/he is being manipulative, then that is all you need to know---then sever the ties (do so by simply ignoring if you can).  It is never easy to do, as I had to sever mine a couple of times in the past.  Your mental and emotional health is more important.   *hug*I get violations for no apparent reason fairly often as well.  This is a bit like the guy with a darwin fish on his car who finds it vandalized all the time.  When you're in the minority, a$$wipes will attack you.. . I think the nutters don't realize this only fuels the flame to deconvert their children when they aren't around.i always get violations. . this is not something that pays you money. . this is something that if you do bad you get the email. . you can be mad about it, or you can just say, . . i always get violations. . this is not something that pays you money. . this is something that if you do bad you get the emailsimply change your nickname and adhere to Yahoo standards as well as common sense
Today, for the first time after several weeks, I saw a link on the new Yahoo home page for me to revert back to the old one. I am now with the old sweet home.Right now they are just testing it to see if people like it. It should go back to the old one soon.
You can also do a members search, and look for people who are in the same state as you, or who have the same interests as you do. . . Then you get a bunch of matches and they can pm you that way.They have a "script" (home-made program) which sends out random test e-mails to every possible combination of addresses, or even just starts immediately with the spam, (preferably from a "spoof" address - a false sender address), and if the program does not receive a "NO SUCH ADDRESS" from the server, it knows the address is valid, and then the ads begin.. . Forgive the run on sentences, I'll repent later.If your allow your profile to be in the profile directory, if you'll notice, they just seem to go down the list of screen names on those.u can type ne name in and it could be a screen name and they find u that way...if they start to harass u u can block themi get IM's from people all the time and i wondered the same thing...when you make your profile it asks you if you want to add your name to the yahoo member directory if you dont check that box then no one will be able to find you...people can do a search by names or location and they can find you based on the info you have in your profile most of the time its just random people looking anyone to chat with. . . to change this go into your yahoo profile and then to edit information and at the bottom of the profile there is the yahoo member directory boxfrom here probally, they can take you email or you sn if you use either of those for yahoo, then they can use those to talk to you.Alot of things are random, people just type in names with numbers, and trust me this is interent time. THEY will find you lolin fact I never saw this screen name before, now you JUST gave it out to EVERYONE HERE NOW!!! this is how. NOW WE ALL HAVE YOUR SCREEN NAME.
Contact customer service.  This forum will not help you with that.yes you verified it already
U read d book, How to write and speak better in English. This book is published by Reader's Digest.speak in front of a camera play the interviwee & at the same time the interviewer ask the question & answer them back as if your facing another person thereby you would get the confidence in facing & answering people at job interviews. Have fun.Try to improve first your vocabulary and also try to  always speak in English. But most important is to be confident about yourself and always think positive.Be confident in yourself.. Buy Communication/Conversational Tapes.. Watch Talk Shows.Hello.... If you would allow me to be of help to you,maybe you can take some of these advices.....     1) to improve your speaking skills,you can practice in front of a mirror everyday when you wake up or whenever you have time ( i would say do it whenever you brush your hair). This would help you gain confidence and you could correct yourself too specially on how you utter the words. I believe in the saying "practice makes perfect".....     2)have self-confidence.Always remember that you are a unique person and nobody else in this world could ever equall you.It is up to you if you would see yourself as a loser or you would strive hard to be better than others.Take the positive one.Think you are better than them and you could prove it to everybody who dare you to..      3)be competent on your own field.I mean on the job you are applying for.If you are that knowledgeable and skillfull enough on you own field of endeavor,you are ready to answer any querry about that and dont forget to put your heart with your work..       4)above all, pray for God's guidance and help because there is no one else who could help you more than Him whom we owe everything.Prayer can move mountains,as Christians believe, and I do.. . I hope you could get some ideas from this and I could be of help to you...... . Good luck and God bless!Watch yourself, especially your mouth in the mirror.  Try to make the same shapes and sounds as you have heard or watched on television.. . Of course, believe in yourself.  Take baby steps.  Go slowly during the interview.. . Get acquainted with those that use English as their first language.  Ask that person for a date...anywhere...and to be your teacher.  I did that when I lived in Turkey and found I learned Turkish quite quickly when I had Turkish friends.  You mimic what you hear, thus becoming better at duplicating those sounds.  And your friends will correct you if you are mispronouncing anything.  Plus you are having fun with your new friends !  . . You are improving your communication skills by being with a strange group.  You now need to rely on what you have learned to get the message across.. . I hope you find the job of your dreams.
Just put yr DOB as 1980 instead of 1979.I don't think you can change your date of birth. They use it to validate your identity. I'm the same age for last 6 years.
It's just a glitch in the server. Yahoo! will have it fixed in no time.I was going to ask the same thingI have the same problemit's yahoo not you or me or anyone else that is going to answer this questionThe question may have been deleted.There's a glitch in the system right now--I noticed the same thing.I think there is a problem with the siteI don't know, it's doing that to my screen too, even though there's about 5000 questions out there.i dont know, it keeps happening to me tooI answered all the question correct.  yahoo has no fresh ones.  :)I think there must just be a fault because it keeps happening to me too!I think Yahoo! Answers is clearing up all of the old questions and for a temporary moment or two, they will not display the active questions. I was just wondering the same.server problems?. . Happening to me, too.I think there is some error. Because there are many, many questions in this site, people never stop sending questions.The world must be ending very,very soon as all the questions of man have been resolved-except even that category is closed to our view! Yikes. REPENT THE END IS NEARchmsYea maybe some server problems or a glitch of some sort.happening right nowMaybe the idiot behind the Q & A website. was drunk the day when he was told how. to resolve such issues.i guess cuz your ansering alot of questions that just happened to me but i clicked all categories
This should be somewhere in your system settings, depending on which OS you are using. You will be able to adjust the time zone there.doesn't it correct itself,,pretty well everything I have does itself,,time.windows.com
The only reason Outlook can do it is because the servers track the email.  Yahoo doesn’t track the mail that way.At this time Yahoo! doesn't have such a feature to tell you wheather your receipients had read the mail or not. Read Reciept feature is availble with RediffMail.com.
You can go to your account info and add "profiles" under your ID and use those for chatting/etc. If you are wanting a new ID entirely, delete it and make a new one.You can't. Jusr register another one.
Every email have a option of Blocking some undesirable elements and report them as junk. So block them and report them as junk and the undesirable mails will stop.From your Yahoo mail page, in the upper right corner click on "Options".  Near the bottom of the first column "Spam", click on "Block Addresses".  Then put in the troublesome addresses.. . Good luck!Apply your self-centered vision of censorship to the rest of the world. Or just close your email account.. . Of course, if you mean The Undesirables that's a different story. First, you'll need a barrel of chocolate cream, two big spoons, a square yard of indoor/outdoor carpet, some corn oil, and a lawn mower engine. I forget the rest of the recipe but I'm sure you can find something to use around your house. Anyway, filter the corn oil through the indoor/outdoor carpet. Use one of the big spoons to spread the chocolate cream in your yard making a complete circle around your house. Refine the corn oil and use it to run the lawnmower engine, inside your house. Once your house fills with smoke take the other spoon and eat the rest of the chocolate cream while sitting on your kitchen table naked. That should do it.
you mean msn messenger..hit Start Control Panel then hit Add/Remove programes and then select Msn Messenger and hit RemoveHotmail messenger? for real?

Don't think you can unless you are the owner or the moderator of the groupNice try, but only the owner/moderator can change those functions.  If anybody could, then the security features of the groups would not be necessary.The group owner or a moderator with  "Add, remove, and change moderator privileges" enabled, can make the change.
If yahoo mail is your default email you can set up Outlook Express and leave Yahoo as the default.. . You can go the Help site in your Yahoo email and it will tell you how to set up the Outlook Express.. . You can also open OE and click on tools and the Account and set up OE and be sure you check for it to leave a copy on your server.. . After setting up through Account the select Options in Tools and make any settings you want or need in there.I believe yahoo and outlook are two different e-mail sites. You have to use yahoo by internet.
if your current version is working fine, you might want to leave it alone. I've seen a lot of people come in here and say they updated it, and then it didn't work.go to the messenger page on yahoo. . but i agree that if your program is working fine and you don't need the up grade don't change it.  Most people that do the up grade wind up having problems with the program and have to do a lot of re-configuring.visit the yahoo messenger homepage:)Messenger.yahoo.com. . compare the version numbers.ask 4 help!!!!!

Sum peeps write n slang, that still Englsh? . Othrs just lernin English, izzat still English?. Yahoo needz 2 define whaz Nglish and whzznot!Originally the site was only for English questions (it's still in beta mind you...) but now they are starting to branch out to other regions/languages:. . http://uk.answers.yahoo.com/. United Kingdom. . http://ca.answers.yahoo.com/. Canada. . http://au.answers.yahoo.com/. Australia. . http://in.answers.yahoo.com/. India. . I wouldn't report abuse about a legitimate translation question as long as the question was in English.u write in ur language using english letters but only ur community will understand that........so u can read the questions . and ya u can ask 4 translations DUHBecause this site was created in California. If you typed in a different language then you wouldn't get very much answers.I agree, it seems a bit odd although there are now international versions.. . I am happy to ignore posts that I don't understand.. . Peace outIF YOU WANT QUESTIONS IN ANOTHER LANGUAGE THEN FIND A WEBSITE IN THAT LANGUAGE, MY COMPUTER DON'T UNDERSTAND OR TRANSLATE.Its because there are different sites for different languages. This is the english oneEnglish is the language of the world. I think the site would become very annoying very quickly if there were questions in 20 different languages, and you have to sift through them, missing out on a good opportunity to answer some great questions, to find the ones in english.It's because Yahoo! is a fascist entity.. . Maybe not. I just like the word fascist.
ON IE: By going to tools and clicking on Internet Options and then selecting Clear History under The History Tab. (Assuming you meant addresses)I don't think you can.  So your Mom/Wife will always have a clue......
There is a lot of differences between the two network types.:. . Cingular and T-Mobile uses GSM(current global standard, all-digital).. . Sprint PCS (not Nextel by Sprint) and Verizon Wireless use CDMA(digital/analog).. . GSM or Global System for Mobile Communication is a network that uses GSM850/GSM900/GSM1800/GSM1900. It is a network that uses SIM (Subscriber Identity Module) cards. Cingular uses both 850MHz and 900MHz, and so do all GSM carriers in North America. Other countries use either 1800MHz or 1900MHz. (3GSM uses sim cards too, but allows you to go to the internet at faster speeds, and can allow you to commence a video call.). . CDMA or Code Division Multiple Access, is an analog/digital technology for networks, that enables CDMA users to take advantage of analog roaming. CDMA phones do not have a SIM card door, so switching cellphones is completely network dependent.the name loooooolGSM: a network that uses a basic connection interface that comunicates with one phone tower at a time.. CDMA: will commuicate with 2 towers at a time and can change between analouge and Digital(GSM) stystems, which is why better in regional areas. . and for future reference 3G networks use 3 towers at once, hence why they called 3g and can send video phone calls etc
It's allows you to type an email to send at a later time. It also allows to you edit it, like a draft copy or a "rough" copy.for saving a letter that youve started and want to work on and send later, i believe.It's for saving emails that you start working on and haven't sent out yet.It's to save an email that you started so you can finish it at a later time. Useful for business emails and long friendly emails.It is for saving emails when you are not done and so when you have time you can edit and send itthanks for these answers,i have been wondering about myself.

if you're talking about on yahoo messenger you hit contact then go down to message archive..if you dont see what you are looking for..you can contact yahoo at (408)349-1572 and they can help you do what you are wanting to doWell U can unplug the computer, take the battery out, and move the jumper. Then put the jumper back into it's right place, replace the battery and replug the machine. When u do this u need to leave the battery out for about five minutes, before replacing it.. . If u do this there will be no password.Uh, can't you just view the history? Why do you have it set to password protected? It doesn't normally come like that.Click history box above the address bar.
mine is nov. 16 y u asking bout me ?March 9. You can find pics of his 19th at rapdirt.comeven though I don't like bow wow because he cheated on Ciara I'll tell you his birthday is March 9,1987.Enjoy!!!!!!
I am sorry to tell you this, but they are all removed.  Too much Knurling maybe?  :)They're removed.  You just THINK you see them.  It's an iluuuuusion!Same place as my picture..lost in spaceto make you ask questions like thisThey are in the beta stage still, and that falls under wait and see.
I think someone knows your password and logged in from somewhere.That happens to me sometimes, too.  Sometimes while I'm sitting at my computer, with messenger open.  I thought it was just a bug.You would need to subpoena Yahoo I think.. . Fat chance.I don't know that you can find out WHO did it but I would suggest changing your password because the only way someone can do that is if they've hacked your account or if they know your password.  Either way, your best solution is to change your password.Find out who knows your ID and Password !
There should be a link at the top to "Switch Back."  If you don't see it, try clearing you cookies.  The new page only stays around for a few days.  You might want to give Yahoo some feedback as to what you didn't like about the new page.You can send them feed back about it as well.. http://events.yahoo.com/326123171.html?source=342
i had that numerous times a while ago.. . just keep refreshing as it seems yahoo is a mess at the moment as some are having problems with avatars, y360 feeds etc . . just wish yahoo would actually reply when u inform them of probs but i guess thats asking too much !Don't worry about it, people are getting it all over the place O.oerror 999 technically means too many attempted failed logins. I get these sometimes, and there isn't really much you can do. The best way is to probably restart your modem (if you are on adsl) and get reassigned another IP address from your ISP. I haven't tried this as yet but it would be something worth trying.I have getting them too on yahoo games when I try to switch identities or rooms.  I have tried to refresh the page and clear my internet fils, but i can only get back into yahoo games if i reboot my computer... What a pain!
try reunion.com or classmates.comGo to Classmates.com   That should work!Well you could do a search for "FIND SOMEONE" and about 10 different subjects will appear that you can pay for to find someone OR... . 1. call 1-555-1212 which is national directory listing and ask for their number as long as you know their last name and it helps if you can remember their parents names because some may have gotten married.. 2. if you have a nextel cell phone and service you can call them and do the same and they will even give you their address.. that # is 411
because the answers are basically anonymous and sometimes it is better to ask a stranger a question then a friend.  A friend doesn't want to hurt your feelings, and strangers will be 100% honest because they have nothing to lose.Because it is fun and mysterious!. . =^_^=Great way to meet good looking women like u! Now u know what I'm up to.  Just Email me or IM me or 360 my page.  I'll be there waiting for u.  I think I'm in love.  See Ya at 360.. LYA! . CHUCK. CHUCK. :-# )yeah, i agree with ecream. and maybe people you know might not know certain things, so you have to ask someone else anyway.because it is an expression of the unique construct called the internet.. . the internet has been used for many things which we already do, like advertising and auctions. . . big deal.. . this is a totally new idea.
Right click on Start and choose Properties from the menu. A box will appear with two tabs one for the start menu and one for the task bar. Click the tab for the task bar. At the bottom of the screen click Customize. A box will appear with all the icons that sit by the notification area. Go and find the one which is the mail icon and click on the action box. Select Disable or always hide which ever it says. . . Now, go into Messenger Preferences and choose the Alerts and Sounds tab. There uncheck the "Enable Alert Sounds" check box. You will now no longer receive any alerts or sounds when new mail arrives.. . Good luck and have a nice day.Go to Yahoo Messenger Preferences (Go to Messenger Menu, select Preferences). Select Alerts & Sounds category and uncheck every checkbox for alert when "I receive a message in Yahoo! Mail"Which IM program do you use?Go into the settings and turn off the notifications.I would think that most people would want to be notified, unless you are trying to hide it from someone else that you are doing the IM when you shouldn't be.
what should i do? and is this love? or why do people ask the same question over and over again?, u have no idea how many of those i came across withbeauty.Relationship & Finance related.sex and relationshipsdumb onessexWhat is love.
Those r the quesions which the asker puts for voting,that usually happens when he's unable to decide for himself which one is best!. . .   I HOPE ITS NOT THE CASE WITH U!"undecided question" means u need to vote. . If you take no action and the question expires, it automatically goes to a vote.. ^_^The qs. that are put to vote by the Asker.Undecided questions are when the asker cannot decide on a best answer. This allows the people in voting decide on what the best answer was. Most of these end up being cheated on. =P
Normally people advance slightly more in English class before attempting real communication.  But keep trying.  You'll get it someday.Hi to you 2
You will need to click on the Yahoo! Toolbar "pencil" icon and select "Toolbar Options".. . Tick 'enabled tabbed browsing'Click on Toolbar options, under the pencil, then click enable tabbed browsing.agree with the first one  so  follow what he  say ,,,,,
yes just type in his email when you mail himYes.  Just enter his or her email address in the to:  box.
Yeah, I think some of those guys on levels 6 and 7 are on here for a very long time everyday. Then on top of that, some of them are very smart. I looked at their pages and something like 30 or 40 % of their answers are picked as best answers. It is just crazy but good for them.Answer your daily quota of questions, then you can continue voting in unresolved questions, but I'm not sure if this will give you the 1000 points you're referring to.I think those prolly get points on weekendsI have no idea. I would think it was impossible unless they had some kinda racket going on.You need to be on a higher level so you can answer more questions daily.  Reach your maximum number of questions answered and start voting on resolved questions.  If you have asked questions, choose the best one.
Probably so people don't ask stupid questions such as What's up? or Am I cool?ask your self that by looking at your questionBECAUSE IT IS OWNED BY THE KKK, NAZI'S, BLACK PANTHER AND CAPTIN AMERICAWhat GOOD question could you possibly ask that, including spaces, is less than 10 characters?Do they?I don't knowBe cause there are no questions worth askin gthat are less than 10 characters.  Space bars count as characters alsoAsk them...........
When you are on a web site you like and it has an Rss feed you can click on it.  Copy it and past it to you 360 page.  then the updates will show up on your 360 pageYou can share your rss feeds, but only sites that have rss feeds. You can do this by selecting my page on your yahoo360, click on share feeds, and if you have a website that is an rss feed, put in the website, and click save, and when you go back to your yahoo360 page it will appear in a box below your blog box.you can change you're theme it is right above My Page. but if you are wanting an rss feed for questions you ask. All you have to do is go to your "My Q&A" page and find the RSS link on the right side of the page. That's your own feed to show your questions. Right-click on it and copy shortcut to paste in back into Yahoo! 360. but if you are wanting the main rss feed i can help you with that to just i m me
maybe your avator could show you:)Something that makes everybody(including) you Happy.. Your avatar shows you marvolous smile!!!. Keep Smiling and keep making everybody Happy!!. Bye:-)to impress othersYou're on Candid Camera?smile which makes other smile..i.e. smile.. :) I think u might have felt it rite away..u are smiling..hai naa :)a curve on ur lip??hehe
It is news to me. I am sure it would be an eyeopener to many and a relief to other users who are feeling its effect on their nerves already. THANK YOU FOR ALERTING ALLIt has never happened to me.  I doubt if they suspended you altogether for a single question.  But here you are, back again.  . . Now, what you need is a thesaurus.  Look up the polite terms for each of the things you want to talk about, and develop a sort of clinically objective style when asking questions about sexual matters.  And be sociologically clinical when you want to ask things about race or gender identity, etc.  We can ask anything (well, OK, almost anything; you may have to fudge around a bit if you want to ask questions about illegal activities) as long as we are polite.. . As to how to "fudge around" about illegal activities, write your question from the point of view of someone who would never do that yourself.  For example, you obviously would never smoke an illegal herb, would you?  Would you?  I mean, it's illegal, so you never would, right?no it didn't.. But maybe u posted it in the wrong place.it's your bad luck.. don't be so explicitIt is the first time I heard it.  There are lots of sexually explicit questions in this place, so why don't they able to find it?!  . . So sad that you lose 800 points.  You'll find justice in the some other time.No it didn't happened to me, because i never asked these type of questions on such a public forum.I've heard of this happening to other people, however it's never been for just one question, it's usually been for repeat offenders.. . Usually Yahoo sends an email telling you why they deleted your question/answer and gives a polite warning and a reminder of the Community Guidelines, or so I believe.
try pressing Ctrl + H to see all of ur contacts who are online or all contacts. to make sure, add ur friend's ID.It is very easy your messenger will ask u to keep him on your  friends list if u want him say yes if u don say no thats it
First You Gotta Open The Whatchamacallit. Then You Move The Little Doohickey. And Put The Widget In There Next To The Thingamabob. Make SURE You Dont Block The Thingy Next To The Doohickey. You Move The Little Doohickey BACK To The Way It Was. CLOSE The Whatchamacallit. And Your Widgets Are Ready To Launchjust open the widget from the my documents&#92;my widgets folder.  the widget will re-open when you restart windows if it was open when windows last shut down.Counter clockwise. Remember to use a 3/8th inch widget wrench, and don't make the fuse too short.. . And, of course, keep on keeping on with the widget chant.Most people use the optional widget wrangling attachment.Just double-click the icon and the Widget should launch in the launcher.you have to load 'em head first so their legs don't get caught in the mechanism
That's considered point gaming. You can still give the ten points to the person of your choice, but you're not supposed to enhance the competitive impulse by announcing it. BTW, is your name Ernie? Elvis? Ethelred? Eowyn?  Esmeralda? Ermentrude...?because it was inapropriatedont see any reason why it should have been removedericEdward or EddieI was wondering that myself.  I entered a bunch of E names and they're gone now.  Evan Edgar, Elmer, Eugene, Eamon, Ed, Eddy, Evan, Everett, Evert, E, Eustace, Edmund, Edmond, and a bunch I can't remember now.they usually say y it is removed.Maybe because they thought ur question was illegitimate.Because it was stupid? - nah, that can't be it - most of the questions on here are stupid & obscene and half of them you can't even read!. . Eeyore is your name =). . Actually - your avatar says your name is Dillon and that does not start with an 'E' - so that is probably why your 1st question was removed!like, I dont know.. i'm guessing Erichum, like ummm. maybe because you think that you can report people for telling you simply that your question is stupid. which, is no reason to report anyone anyway. serves you right.Well that's a stupid question to have asked.  Maybe it broke some yahoo rule?. . Is your name Evon?well thats stupid, eric edna enus ericka, enrique, eugine, esmerelda, edgar, eathan, edmund?ELMO!!!!!!!!!!!!! HAHAHA    I LUV UR SHOWI noticed that.  I wondered why it was removed.  Are you the famous MR. ED?emanuel
If you click on your name you'll see a page with your email address displayed. Under that you'll see 'Edit your profile' click there and you'll find the option to remove your address from your profile.Your email doesn't show when you ask questions or answer them as a matter of factChange your profile so other people on YA cannot contact you. . Click on my q+a and then edit info.. Untick the messenger and email options. . They will then just be able to see your user name.. . Hope this helps
Cause yahoo is gay. I cant view webcams either, and I cant find the ActiveX control anywhere on the net or in their site (except I know the name of it is "Yahoo WebCam Viewer 2004" or YWV.exe). . Good luck to you.Go to http://www.oatmealmedia.net and the their viewer,It works SOOOOOOOOO much better and doesn't ask for permission.
The reason they delete it is because it is not fit to been seen. But what gets me is why they even say they deleted a question. Why not just delete it and not even mention it?LMAOI am not sure! SORRY!because it's been deleted...That would ruin the whole point of deleting it, dont you think???because they wanna hurt the feelings of curious sneaky people like you
Why would you want to do that? My Avatar thinks your Avatar is HOT!Go to yahoo 360,download a pic there--then you can use it on here.create a 360 acct. on yahoo.ok this is wut you do go to yahoo go to yahoo 360 and make an account and then do all that stuff you want and post a picture of yourself over there and then have it saved and then go to yahoo answers and change your stuff and for picture put use my 360 image and you will see it thereyou have to have yahoo360If you just want your pic to appear on Messenger and IM  windows go to your messenger options and select "change my display image" from there you can upload a pic from your computer to appear as your image. You can do the same thing on a 360 page.  Hope this helped a little :)I don't think you can besides why would you want to do that?
Most don't do it for points, but because they like to answer question.. . Many will answer ( as I do) questions on various other question and answer sitesWhy not?? Some people are really willing to help others. I have found that the more I type on here, the easier it may be for someone to understand what my answer is. If you type it too short and sweet, someone might not get it. I also enjoy typing. I can type for hours and hours.  I like reading the longer answers because I feel that they are more truthful. People who type less than one sentence answers usually just dont care about the question and JUST care about the points. Therefore, I am more trusting of a lengthy answer than a short one. Hope this thorough answer is helpful. . . *24*because they might just know something about the subject and try to help the askerMaybe they're actually answering the question to help someone, rather than being a point grubbing opportunist?Don't know.HELLO!!!!!. . THAT'S WHAT THIS IS ABOUT!!!!. . THANKS FOR THE 2 POINTSCause it's not just about the points for everybody - some of us want to help people if we can.maybe because we want to help others just as we want to be helped... of course there are the greedy ones that come here n answer any spudity and get away with a "score" but others actually come n answer questions u know... am 50.50 lolAccumulating a lot of points isn't going to get you anything.  Giving out a lot of good information gets you a seat at the right hand of Odin in Valhalla.Maybe people think they have the answers for everything.They're perfectionists?  They're not in it for the points?  I dunno.  What do you think?The purpose is to answer, not to get 2 points.  Thoroughness is good as long as it's to the point.I think the people who push reams of text into their answers were waiting for the question to be asked. A lot hat I've seen just copy (steal) somebody's web page and post it here. . . Makes 'em feel smart.I don't really care about the points. (What are they really worth anyway?) I just like to answer an honest question with an honest answer and if someone gets something out of it, fine. I tried.cuz if they have a lot of information the person will choose them as the best answer and they will get TEN points.:]]they want their answer to be voted as best answer
Next to the word "folder" you will see 2 options: add and edit, click on edit. now it shows a list of all your folders and next to each folder you see the options: rename or delete, click on the one you need.I'm assuming you're using Yahoo! Mail (classic).. . Click the "Edit" link next to Folders.  Then, simply click the "rename" link next to the folder you're using.First point to it, and right click on it.high light it and go to file and see if you can rename it like that"To rename a folder, follow these steps: . . Go to the SBC Yahoo! Notepad page. . Click the Notepad Options link on the right side of the page. . Click the Notepad Folders link. . Choose the folder you would like to rename from the pull-down menu in the Edit Folders section. . Click the "Change Name" button and a small pop-up window will appear. Type in the name of the new folder and click "OK." . Click "Done" to go back to the main SBC Yahoo! Notepad page.".  . Hope this helps!
it is not yahoo or any other site that remembers u r id, but it is stored as cookies in u r computer by the particular site,. so the problem is with u r computersame thing happpens to me i think it is yahoo cause it dosn't happen with hotmail. so i hope u find out cause it enoys the shit out of me.i think your computer have a problem and your yahoo messenger software have a problem,too
There's a facility on yahoo where you can have two mail addresses directed to the one mail box.  I have it, cant' remember how i got though, so just mooch around yahoo mail and you should be able to sort yourself outsuck my throbbing cock.
Any time it says "Whoa!" that means multiple points activities have taken place. Just go to your Q&A and look at your recent activity to see it there. Each time your points badge is shown, it'll reflect all the activity that has taken place (up to six activities) since the last time your points badge was shown.Yes it is possible - while you were asking the question you got a thumbs up ... the score only updated when you exited asking the question - it totals all activity since it last updated
Several reasons, laziness, egotism, who knows???Because they're either very young and don't have the wisdom to look for similar questions or they're just too flipping lazy to look to see if there's any similar ones or they're just trying to get people's goats by repeating inane questions.Like the 7,000 that ask who got voted off American Idol?. . Or, the 20 questions a day about weiner size "penis size-does it matter".  "Ladies, is my wiener big enough to satisfy".  Like they don't see the 2 million other posts that come up when they type in their version of the question.I think they prefer not to see the box. I didn't know it actually happened, so I went to try it out - there's 1149 similiar questions to "Who won American Idol?". Don't worry, I didn't ask it!Yeah , I know "wich came first the egg or the chichen ". I've seen many tmes , I guess pepole are either new. To Yahoo or just don't pay attentionWhy do people tend to repeat some questions that have already been asked?maybe they have not read some of the questions or answers that have been put on here... there is a lot i do not understand why some people ask such questions..but i guess we can have fun and gather the points...something to do and interesting....Lack of imagination. Comes from spending too much time on-line and not enough interracting with people.i was wondering about that too, guess they have nothing to do.Either they are brain dead and forgot, or they have run out of things to say, or they are trying to test your memory.I encounter that problem quit a bit, and I just be patient and let them speak. And give them the same answer you did before. Then if they repeat themselves, tell them you already heard it.
Its just another form of prejudice, like there's no overtly gay avatars, either. lolI think they should get them because not everyone is skinny. I'm not overweight but some are.Sounds like a good hobby for a computer graphics artist.  One could create his/her own avatar and post it.  You don't have to use Yahoo's pictures.HAHAHAHA I would love to know that!bcoz everyone wanna show other ppl that they r not fat but fitdude they should have them but like i dont care cuz im like super skinny but they should get themwould be very apt for me... should be all shapes and sizesbecause they wont fit in the boxes.Interesting Question!!Because fat is ugly!!!  Just kidding...that's a really good point/question though.  Maybe it's because the yahoo team is too lazy to make fatter avatars.yeah!Who's 'you'?bad publicity i guess ????Does it mean that you are fat & can't find a suitable avater ?or old ones??If they had fat avatars, they'd have to redraw all the clothes to fit on a fat body, and it'd probably take a lot of effort.  Personally, I would like if you could mix and match facial features.
Do you mean the pop-up blocker on the Yahoo! Toolbar? If so, you can disable it, but not remove it. To disable it, click on the pop-up blocker on the toolbar and select Enable Pop-up Blocker, which will remove the checkmark in front of the command and disable it.You should be able to uninstall it.You can check under tools, options, and depending on your server the checkable boxes for pop up blocking will be right on the content page, which you can uncheck.
it's when a guy's XXXX is as large as a dino's so it can go all the way up a girls XXXX and into her tummy. . <-- my guessDinosaurs having sex with their mate's tummy.I don't think it means anything.  It is probably just something said to get the station attention.. http://2004.channel955.com/mojo_main.html
I think there's a limit on the number of answers to encourage new people to participate by not just answering questions, but also by asking questions, voting for Best Answers, and rating Best Answers. As you gain more points, you can answer more questions, until you reach 5,000 points -- then you can answer an unlimited number of questions.They do it because if there was not limit then it is possible to program a computer in such a way that the computer will answer the questions. You see that its not necessary to write something in here after thinking about it, you can just answer even if you like to put any random words. To make such bots or computers there are limits and other policies.Because they do not want us to act like know it alls!You have to earn the right to answer more.I think it's because they don't want you to burn yourself out on it and get sick of it.  Setting a limit makes it seem a little more special, don't you think?So that you won't be spending all of your free time answering questions and getting the points that can't really be used?yes, 10b/c otherwise everyone would just be asking questions and not answering them.
click tools. internet options. click use current. (when on that screen)A specific answer depends on your web browser software, as each have slightly different ways of controlling this.  But in general, first go to the my yahoo page (http://my.yahoo.com), then look for "preferences" in your drop-down menus, and look for a set home page option.  when you find it, if you are currently on the my yahoo page, you can simply click on "use current" (or some similarly worded option).  good luck.Go to http://www.yahoo.com and in the upper right hand corner of the page choose the icon that says My Yahoo.  Click on the boxes for the information you want displayed on the page and choose SAVE.  You'll most likely be asked to sign in.  Once you've signed in, and your new page comes up, in the top left hand corner of the page you'll see "Make My Yahoo! your home page".  You'll get a window prompt - Do you want to make yahoo your home page.  Just select Yes and you're set.Go to Control Panel(Either in your start menu or in the left hand side of My Computer). Go to Internet Options and click on the 'General' tab. There will be a section called 'Home page'. Fill in the blank beside it with the internet page you want to appear when you open your internet explorer. Click 'apply' and 'ok'. You're all set.
If you're trying to delete many at a time, it won't work.  You can only delete about 8 at one time.  Try deleting some after an hour and see if they remain deleted.  If they come back, try again after several hours or the next day.right click it and press delete and ignoretry deleting them from your yahooo messenger and then sign in to yahoo mail go to address and delte their contact from thier as well. thats how i get rid of mines

Yahoo Answers has a search box on the right handside of the home page. Type in your friends screen name and it will give you a list of things they have answered. The first thing on the list should be the persons Yahoo Answer's profile (it looks exactly like your "My Q&A".Advanced search / search by nick name.You must know the person's nick name though

IF you still have the photos in your hard drive, go to the add photo option and delete the existing album and re upload the photos again.. It should work.I hope this comes through now. I just had an answer typed up, but Internet Explorer crashed.. . First, go to any 360 page and click the link near the top that says "My Page". Then click "Share Photos" near the top right. Under "Yahoo! Photo Albums" I'm hoping you'll see a bunch of albums. Set each of the drop down boxes to "Can be seen by: Public", then click "Save" at the bottom of the page.

Poutine is a uniquely Canadian dish (and so am I).. French fries, cheese curd topped with gravy.. Heaven on a dish!. YUMMY!. :)Poutine is french fries with gravy and cheese.  Traditionally a pot cheese is used (think of firm cottage cheese), although it can be made with almost any cheese these days.  . . I think it's a marvelous dish.  My doctor does not approve :)
I make music notes by searching deep inside the crevasses of my heart, groping for each and every emotion to capture the best feeling to manifest. It usually happens when I'm in love.How do you make the hearts?no but how do u make heartsare you serious....how do you make hearts? I want to make em'. -beaver (Rock Island, Illinois)I think you can see a list of all the ASCII characters by Googling "ASCII".. I'm not sure if you can make all the music notes though.
it is all in your mind. get rid of emotions and you will never be sad againthe worst feeling caused by the result of the unexpected or unpleasing action,...,....,Sadness:. . Sadness, the muse of artists and the cross of madmen, differs from depression, the cold, hard clinical turn of phrase for a "downturn in mood," which is, after all, itself mere metaphor. Under sadness's auspices, great works have been created, for it itself is a cousin of truth: the understanding that we are a prisoner of our environments, genetics, and fate.Being in the same room with a person that you truely love and can't act on your feelingssadness is having no money after all if you had money you would be happyopposite of happinessthings that make you feel unpleasure.Sadness is the things that hurt us, mistakes that cause other pain, the wrongs we can not right, unsaid apologies, things that make cry, things we try to forget or at least remember and try to make ourselves a better person.....but true sadness  is not wanting to make yourself happySadness is a feeling - it's one of the many normal human emotions, or moods, we all have. Sadness is the emotion people feel when they've lost something important, or when they have been disappointed about something, or when something sad has happened to them or to someone else. When they're lonely, people often feel sad.

if u use another computer . so u need to setup the archive again on that computer. ^_^Are you sure you were once able to view these archives on another computer? Because that would be really odd as the logs of your chats and calls is stored on your hard drive and not on the Yahoo mail server as e-mail is. . . The reason you can't view the archives is due to the fact they are stored on the hard drive of your computer with the program installed on it. While you can use somebody Else's messenger to chat and send e-mails, the archive on their computer would be of their chat and voice sessions, not yours. Now, it is possible that your chats while on that computer would be stored on that computer, but not the ones from your computer.. . Sorry to have to report this, but it just is not possible to view archives unless you are on a network and have your archives on a share to the computer you are now trying to access them from. That is a process I don't have time to walk you through, as it would be about setting up a network share between those two computers if they are on the same network.
See up there in the upper right corner, where it says "Home - Help - Forum?"  Click on "Forum."no, but i wish they did have one, that would be kool!this is your forum pretty muchyes, its called yahoo messanger. u can find it on my yahoo.i think it call a chat room.pimpeni think yahoo messangeris a way to communicate  and just go to www. yahoo messanger.com. my id is kbuggerfly
try to shut off the firewall protection, and verify in the internet settings the security level (med-low), what operating system do u have? maybe u downloaded the incorrect version of yahoo messenger ... good luck!Just a glitch!. Try to restart it!. Or try uninstalling it, and install it again...
do you know for sure?? you are just generalizing.Who cares! Why does everything have to be such a fight.so what?. no big deal?As a black guy who is with a black girl, I have to disagree with the statement that white girls are easy. I met my fiance when she moved in next door to me. We became really good friends and that friendship evolved into something else. Let me tell you, I had to work harder to get her than any other female... EVER. And as for saying that I couldn't take her home to "mum", my mother loves her, adores her, respects her. You just sound like a bitter black girl who got her ass left for a white girl. Maybe you should stop generalizing and look at yourself.firstly they don't ask around before genaralisin, well the truth of it is that white girls are easy and theofore less work to get what they want,ask any guy it takes a lot of work to get what you want form a black girl, we are strong minded and because blakc guys have always been there we dont veiw them as anything special but a white girl will go all out, when they are with a black guys they are used and abused maily or dumped with kids statistics can prove this, for qiuck sex maybe a black man would choose a white girl, to marry and spend futrue with and take home to mum,HELL NO!!! white girls, the love of a black girl is worth the trouble. the quicky with a white girl is worth the 1 min chat up line. ( just genaralising too) not all white girls are like this but magority lack pride and basic decency that most black women posses.donot generalize what you think.Not all do...either one.. . Everyone is attracted to something differentthe media makes white people more beautifulbecause white girls are hotter. black girls are more into drugs and sex. white girls just want a good guy who will take care of them. the public has given black girls a bad name.Chritain sufer chick os bitch and a racist, all she knows what to do is get on her kneesBecause white girls have been historically denied to them.  But once they're with 'em a while, they come back.  At least, that's what happened with me & my hubby.
You ask or answer questions for points that are meaningless.  and for some unknown reason..it is very addicting. . :-)Read the community guidelines buddy.up inthe yahoo answers click on (what's going on on yahoo answers)u ask a Q but u have to asnwer some elses to get points if u lose the point u cant ask anymore Q
under yahoo answers.... choose beauty and style . choose hair. -u can either answer other questions or ask questions regarding hairby going to school first to learn how to read and write!
that's a setting on your email program.  On Yahoo, it's controlled in the Options/Preferences parts of IM.under email options, turn email notification OFFeasily in your preferences  in your yahoo messenger.
Unless they have registered with an information company (like Yahoo 360), then you can't. You can try doing a google search with their email name, but emails are designed to be pretty anomynous. What does the mail say? It might be best to just ignore it - they might have sent it to the wrong person, or it might be a scam.put thier i.d on yahoo,and open profile,if thier e-mail and yahoo has the same i.d.
I think it's mostly to limit the number of questions and answers by new users who frequently ask the same questions that have already been asked and resolved earlier.. . You are sort of encouraged to look for a previously answered question that will work for you rather than simply re-ask it of someone else again.this is a rule.So that we dont get some people flooding us with questions over and over just because they can do that...
Some people are interested in the human perspective versus an algorythmic formula producing a search result. Some people don't know how to use search. Some people just want to chat.Was this a question? Check your spelling on "misspell." ;-).. . Oops. My face is red! I'm a visual speller, and for some reason, "misspell" looked wrong. Of course, I'm spending the week in Jonesboro, Ark and a lot of things are looking wrong to me. My apologies, but ..... made ya look, didn't I? Teeheeheee.Imagine the search results with some of the misspelled words used in some of the questions you're talking about.  At least here people can interpret their questions, albeit while grumbling under their breath, and at least point the askers in the right direction.. . However, I normally won't even click on the question if the asker can't even click on the CHECK SPELLING link at the top of the question field.. . And -- who said MISSPELL is incorrect?  Check out http://www.dictio....  ahh!  I almost did it!  *muttering* I shall not give in to people who can't spell...I have a few ideas on that,. 1) Searching on google for 'anybody else born in march?' just turns up too much. . 2) Searching for 'wassup dogz?' gives too many links to Randy from American Idol. . 3) Correct spelling is for nurds! :-). . 4) People just want to see their avatar in lights!. . ... I need MojoMan to provide a better list, though.Because if you type "what is ****" the search engines all return articles about asterisks.People are crazy for points !!!!It's more fun to get diverse answers from other people.. . But if you're doing a project or something - well, then I don't see a reason unless it's a really strange question.many questions are also opinions thats why. example: whats your favorite color?because you can't always find what you need on google and thats why people come here.HAHA, good question !! I guess it keeps all of us on here busy for a little bit !You don't get points that wayI don't know but it helps me feed my addiction to yahoo! answers!  LOLif u dont like the site so much then honestly why are you on it?????   also not everyone understands how to use the internet like my mom for instance..... plus it takes forever to find just the right info on search engines like google, dogpile, and yahoo.....Well, I dunno, maybe because people dont understand what a Search engine is. lol. Or perhapse because they are lazy. My main guess is they are looking for multiple different answers, and the best one they try, as most questions and answers have multiple different perspectives and views of multiple different people.

red hat gets wetred hat sinks into blue seaGood luck finding a blue sea. Water is clear, it just reflects the colour of the sky, or the mud, as is the case where I live.... As for what would happen to the hat, it would get rather damp, as would you if you are still wearing it. I suppose the die might bleed out, so it could change colour...maybe to pink...it floatsIt gets wet.
This file format is a Macintosh binary compressed file.. . It is the same as the HQX file extension.

These types of emails were automaticallly sent to the adresses on the adress book without the knowing of the owner.
No No!!! . . Delete the person from your page!!. . But make sure you can get to their page yet. While your on their page click ignore!! This will shut them down!!First you have to remove that person from your friends list.  Then go through your settings and make your content available to all friends or just friends in specific categories.  I categorized my friends by 'friends' and 'good friends'  then I can control what content I want viewed by what category.  Hope this helps.
I don't understand your question but try this website. Or are you saying it automatically signs you into another account? All you have to do is sign out and it should show you "log in". Then type in your name and password.Just go to yahoo messenger and download it to the other computer.The person who is the owner may have to give the computer permission.
Ive had alot of them too and i dont know why but i think its because me and you are two great people and sometimes people get jealous,its a sad part of life really! keep smiling,tell your son i said hi..Because it violates the Y!A terms of service.  Asking a question for the sole purpose of awarding points is considered point gaming and is not allowed.  Points should be secondary to the primary purpose of asking good questions and getting good answers.Yea I had that happen too me as well . I think that some people just do that if you don't pick them for the points . just send your explanation to yahoo and forget it .. You are good !maybe because you didn't swear enough next time use the f word ( fuck ) hope this helps, it always helps me. i can't believe that they censored my f word  fuckersThat is about the equivelent of cheating. I'm not here for the points, I'm here to learn something and help people. But there are people here that want the points and probably tried to give you the right answer to your question. So while they are being honest with their answer, you already know the outcome of what your going to do. Come On!!!!That is totally unfair of you to want someone to have the points. (Obviously there important to your friend or you wouldn't be wanting them to have the points.). You need to learn some Scruples!!why what did you do
IF YOU HAVE DAIL UP YOU JUST HAVE TO WAIT SOMETIMESNo one can, only just on some rooms, I have been told that the  Yahoo server has fallen, I would like to know toooo!!!
You cannot get this page on your browser with any trick. However, you may try clearing your cookie, cache & try alternative browser. . Good Luck.You can't. Yahoo! is testing the new home page on randomly selected users. You can't request it. You just have to wait to see if you're one of the lucky ones.
its service by yahoo to show on ur desktop some services u would have it like the time ... weather ...etc .... . good luckthe term widget came from a broadway play/movie (comedy) called "how to succeed in buisness without really trying"  The widget was the product the company manufactured.  It is regarded as an imaginary product in buisness classes.
go to my computer then add delete items delete any yahoo stuff from  your compgo to control panel, then add/remove programs/software, and find yahoo! toolbar and remove/delete it.Control Panel, then Add Or remove programs, remove Yahoo Toolbarit should be under add/remove programs in the control panelgo into your "programs remove" and remove it from the list.
Well, you won't be able to get it back if you forgot the information you provided to yahoo. So, bad luckI am sorry if this is legit you are going to have to try to get in contact with Yahoo!!!!  the reason that you put that correct info and things you know !!!! there not hard questions!!!!  There things you should remember.. so it sounds more like you are trying to get in to someone else account... Now I could be wrong but that is my opinion!!There are several steps to take if you believe you have forgotten your password:. . 1.       Ensure you typed the correct password. Remember, passwords are case sensitive.  See Password Guidelines for more information.. . 2.       Make sure Caps Lock is not enabled on your keyboard.. . 3.       Was the Member ID entered correctly? Make sure you have entered your Member ID and domain which is the same as your full email address. . . 4.       Ensure cookies are enabled. . . 5.       After two unsuccessful attempts, open a new browser window such as Internet Explorer and try again.This is a lesson for u that use correct information so you can remember. I learnt the same lesson more than once.

Yahoo always takes 5 points away for asking questions, it's not fraud, it's the way the game works!. .

U can know only if he is the member of yahoo directory. Otherwise click on view profile by selecting contact options in actions. U may find there some info about him.You can go to Yahoo profiles and search for the name there.The information filed with that name is available,or they may have a Yahoo 360 account,which you can access if they have enabled public access.Any information they allow access too,is a matter for their own personal choice and some people prefer to keep their personal info to themselves.http://members.yahoo.com/xxx. . Replace 'xxx' with the messenger ID. This is all the info you will ever get.run a google search... more often than not, people use one id all for multiple services... so running a google search might give you some results...

If you don't choose and there is no  votes, then it is deleted. I think they are left up for 2-3 weeks and that is it.A question is open for answers for one week. During that time, the asker can select the best answer (resolve the question), put it up to a vote or extend the answering period for one week.. . If the asker does nothing, the question automatically goes to a vote after a week. The voting period lasts one week, though if there is a tie it will stay open for voting until the tie is broken.. . When a best answer has been chosen, the resolved question stays on Yahoo! Answers forever as part of the database so people can search to find answers rather than asking the same question that many other people have already asked.. . The only ways a question would not be in the database are:. - The asker deletes the question while it is still open for answers.. - The question receives no answers and is automatically deleted.. - The question goes to a vote and "No Best Answer" is selected.. - The question is removed for violations of the community guidelines.
I found the easiest way to type symbols for math and physics related questions is by typing the answer on a MS word and then transfer the answer to the box and then click review to check if it works.. Example: µ????.. Another thing that might work is to work out the explorer encoding from view pop up  menu.. Fonts used: Trebuchet MS & Symbol.i agree, using ms word or other advanced word processor program is the best wayMONKEYS!I agree, but using: MS Office(Trebuchet MS & Symbol.)

Rather than forwarding the email, .   - highlight the part of the email you want to send, .   - ctrl C (to copy), .   - open a new email.   - ctrl V (to paste) into the text area of the new emailAfter you click onto forward, type in the name of the address you're sending to, then starting at the lowest address, hit the backspace until you've cleaned them all out.  I've found that they will come back again on the next email, so I either forward from my sent file, or send the reconstructed email to another of my emails, then forward from there.
Look in the trash folder.

If you mean how is best answer chosen, the person asking the questions decides. If you do not pick a best answer, then others get to vote on the best answer, but then you lose  points for not having picked the best one yourself.1 you chose a best answer 2 you put it to a vote 3 you don't do anything to it for a Month then yahoo puts it to a vote and hope that's people give a list one answer the most votes after 7 days other wise it goes  into a tie breaker than it will be there until someone breaks the tieThe asker will choose a best answer or put it too a vote!if u choose da best answer or if u don't 'n oder ppl decide which 1's da best!
That's to prevent spam and abuse. People new to the site sometimes haven't quite learned the rules. If there were no limits at the lower levels, then there would be even more silly, stupid, abusive questions than there are. So the points encourage people to participate, and the limits allow them to learn the ropes without getting too many opportunities for violations or suspensions.in that case people would just start putting any answer just to get there points up in a day they'd accumulate 2500 points.I'm on level 5 and can answer unlimited answers.I guess it's a way to encourage you to reach higher levels and gain that privilege.Maybe The answers team dosen't want you to answer questions 24/7.Points Table Action Points .

Do you mean on Yahoo messenger?  If so then check your font size on preferences.  To do this click on 'Messenger' then 'Preferences' and then click on 'Appearances' and change your font size.  If you mean your yahoo on your browser CLICK ON VIEW and change the size of your text there.Try going to View -> Text Size -> Medium (or a smaller size if you prefer)

The product team is working on it.360 has been having a lot of technical glitches lately.maybe u don't have a B.S. but a B.A.Because it's Arts and Sciences, it's not considered one or the other. Thats how it is at my college too.you might want to go to the advisors office and have them change it for you.Try it on a different computer.. . Or might as well simply restart the bozzow computer. Technical problem that is.You might want to goto the administration office and ask them what to do.Yahoo! 360 is still beta that is why we encounter technical issues. Peace out!it might there are some mistakes in your certificate of your graduate. Please contact your school administration.
its because immigrants from those places have a higher percentage who do come here by legal means enabling them to equal opportunities for education and work as well as health benefits. there is no science behind it. anyone given equal opportunity will assimilate into society a lot better.because america is a melting pot which accepts a variety of backgrounds and cultures making it easy for the immigrants.White Europeans assimilate quite well. Black Africans well not so well.

Everyone should be equal..Although, some of the time we aren't all treated equal. However, it doesn't excuse low lives getting off or making fun of other's race. As long as there's ignorance we'll always in a world of such.maybe they are racistits called tennis. somebody served a ball that went into the racism court. Some fool hit the ball back. now its tit fer tat.Maybe they meant You're happy(Gay)!. . Why does the homosexual community get the exclusive rights to the word gay? . . They don't look like a bundle of sticks (fa-ggot), so I don't use that word to discribe them! Why CAN'T gay mean happy again!
I edit my forwards too before I send them to people.. Here's how it's done, instead of hitting forward click on reply then edit the e-mail address high light and delete it then on the TO: field change it because it will show the person who send it to you.. Test it first by doing those steps then put your e-mail address on the TO: field and see if it works if it does work but go back to the original e-mail and edit it again and follow the steps because from my experience sometimes after sending to myself and I forward the edited one it just doesn't come through the right way, good luck.. . Summary:. Hit Reply->edit the TO field-> edit e-mail-> add contacts->send.u will see a down arrow in the fwd icon then click on " fwd as a inline text " u can edit itSimply copy the text of the message and paste it to a new email you compose.cut and paste the real massage in microsoft word edit the massage as u wish and then send them as attachment.well u can still have got the option to edit as u can select the message wateava u want from that forwarded msg . click on compose and just paste the copied data into it and if u want to send that mail to many pplz i wud suggest u to put the other address in BCC(blind carbon copy ) as this will keep ur security and privacy remains . have a nice time ;)u could download attach and then send it.. . but i think u can delete whtever your want after you hit forward,except for the attachements, . hanks how it works in gmail or anyother mail tough

Ignore list. 5. click add. 6. Type Yahoo id of the person that needs to be ignored. 7. OK. You might want to block that person on your inbox just in case they want to send you e-mails.Just click the ignore button.go to contact and options and select ignorethere is a block button on the messenger and u can block that person u don't want to talk to.What you do is, if they are on your buddy list, put them in your yahoo messenger ignore box, then delete them out of your address book on your messenger and delete them off your buddy list, if they are not on your buddy list, just go to preferences Ignore List, Type in their name and click Add, and then close.

If the question is lame, it deserves a lame answer.. . S.S.I give good answers to get points. I give lame answers (like this one) just for the heck of it.The primary use of levels in intelligence is to create abstractions to some degree, so higher levels can utilize a particular level without concerning itself with the details of implimentation. The completeness of this abstraction defines the strength of the level. The behavior of a strong level can be completely determined by the state of the system at that level, whereas a weak level would allow lower-level phonenomena to influence behavior.You must be the Yahoo asking the lame questionsYEAH THATS RIGHT!! HA HA"For every difficult question, there is an answer that is clear and simple and wrong" George Bernard Shaw. . how many times are you gonna ask the same question?u answered the question yourself!exactly.I only give lame answers to lame questions. I guess its just like finding a bargain in your local walmart. I mean wouldnt you go ahead and grab it by the horns.Anyway whats a couple of points between friends??You answered your own question... to get points!depends on ppl and questions some ppl r really into helping out  other ppl(count me in!) -answering them and others go-hey 2 points! and wat was ur question anyway?. its better if ppl make rite use of this service. but i can't deny one thing here pal-2 pt 4 answering u even if it does no good,who cares ppl jus want to do some thing and r happy that they r fetching somethin-points or free hamburgers is just not the question!Don't worry. There is a growing consensus of us that believes that Yahoo! fully intend Answers to be a self-regulated service. Once several people have shown their worth, we believe they will be 'promoted' to moderators and these lame kids will be mostly history.The answers are definately imbedded in the question:. 1.  They are lame.. AND / OR. 2. Just to get points. . Now, if we could only figure out WHY they are lame ...Have you read some of the questions yourself? It just makes you do it!Why do people ask lame questions and lose 5 points? HA HA I get 2 points!!!When I answer a question, I don't care about points.  I like to give informative answers, and try to help people.  If I don't know the answer, I go on to something else that I'm more familiar with.  There's a saying in the South, "If you don't have anything good to say then don't say anything at all."Penguins - ha!  Two more for me!!!Not all yahoo ppl.Because they want points.I don't...YEP!. . PEOPLE.. don't answer a q unless ur gunna be useful!!it gives them a sense of accomplishment?The question is so lame, it needs to be put down....

u cant send it to anyone . u have to rite it in english liek yes (yesh) and no (Lo) and shalom (shalom) and bye (Lehit) and so on so forthIt does have language support but what happens (I have the same one) is that the language is lost in the server where it's translated from the Unicode characters that are used in HTML to the special codes that Nokia uses. You would need to have a special patch installed on the mail server to solve this issue and I'm afraid most likely that won't happen anytime soon.maybe it doesn't have the lenguige support.

Yahoo does that when you try to load bad pictures in it. Get a good picture of yourself and it'll fly through.the pic you are trying to upload is probably not a jpg format picture...find one that is and try it instead.

Be who you are.  If others can't deal, screw em.Get out the books and study a little. Then you will be better educated, and you will ask more intelligent questions.Why do you think you are'nt a better person...just keep thinking you are the best..no question is silly ...you are just asking your doubts.Why do you think they are silly? Don't bother for other's comments.Have confidence on you....that's the way....just go on....Pick up a book.  There are tons of books out there that can educate you and entertain you on millions of subjects.  I am a fiend for "how to" books.  Anything you can learn is to your credit, wether you get the opportunity to apply the knowledge or not.. . Second, observe people. Sometimes people are too quick to ask questions or comment on something rather than watching things unfold and taking in everything.  Listen, watch, and learn.  Then see if you can tell what will happen next. It give you insight to questions you might have on similar subjects.. . The last, you are already doing.  Ask questions.  Theres nothing wrong with asking questions as long as:. A) you really want to know. B) You have Patience... Is the answer coming anyway? If so, why rush?  Things happen at the pace they do for a reason.. C) You retain what you learn.  Take something away from the learning experience.  You may be able to answer the same question for someone else later.ask yourself first- do I already know the answer to this if I give it even 5 minutes of thought?. ask yourself- will the answers I'm likely to get really benefit me? And will they benefit others who read it?You're a normal person just like everyone else.It takes time and determination, a ton of hard work and with the help of friends, you can be a non-silly-asking-questions person, just like the rest of us.. . *cheer*  -- I believe in you you can do this...Only you can know how to make yourself do that. Maybe try using a little self-control. good lucku will have to win pthers peoples heart by answering the questions wisely.....try 2 get a few best answers....eventually others will have a good impression abt u and will try 2 answer ur questions and u will get a gud response.....then ppl will know that u r not sillyFind a gun and play russian roulette with yourself till one of you loses.Lay off the crack.I don't think any question is too silly (well some are).  But, at any rate silly questions as well as intelligent questions, generate responses.  I learn quite a bit about human behavior in general by reading the responses, and sometimes(more often than not) the response is more enlightening than the question posed.Be silly, it's more fun.OK what silly question are you talking about? And IF you did or have asked silly questions this does not make you a bad person. NOT asking silly questions as you call them will NOT make you a better person. Asking question by far CAN make you smarter as you will learn things that you may not have known before. So I would say ASK AWAY.
Your computer might need a reboot.Have you checked to see if it's compatible ie the latest version of messenger? or maybe the passwords in invisible mode and you've hit the wrong key @ setup?
I agree!  We are taught that it is OK to ask questions when you don't know, but here it is not OK.  What kind of message are they sending out?Only the Yahoo! Answers Team knows.I think its so that we keeps us all intertwined? can't think of the word. But a more response from the yahoo community to all of the questionsThat is what i do, i answer questions that interest me so that i can ask some...although i would have to say i really enjoy this site.Yahoo! does this to minimize the number of questions asked. It helps a lot, to avoid the frustration of repeating questions.I don't know... seems like it didn't start out that way... and what do you get for each level?I KNOW I JUST KEEP ANSWERING SO I CAN HAVE THE POINTS WHEN I NEED TO ASK QUESTIONS

Because they think every body should be "skinny and cute". There is nothing wrong with avatars having freckles, a little more meat on their bones, etc. I agree with you; they should make more avatars with different bodies and sizes.Because they probably haven't thought of that yet.Ive heard this sorta complaint before.  I guess its the psychology of self image.  I mean, weren't we all taught that slim is prettier that husky (im not saying i agree with that), even as young children we play with skinny barbies or handsome and rugged GI Joes.  It all comes down to psychology of the sexes and how yahoo wants to be viewed by the public who chooses avatars to display-i guess different body styles would make people not want them is what they thinkBecause my dear...this is a perfect worldGood question. I think it's because yahoo hasn't either. . a. thought of it. . or. . b. gotten down to doing it. . I think that some pple like the anonymity of an avatar and don't use it as a true representation of themselves. Others, however, do like to have an avatar that represents who they truly are. . . If you are really keen on seeing avatars in different shapes and sizes it mite be a good idea to send feedback to yahoo and hopefully they will add some diff ones one :)Honestly!  I like the avatars, but there are a lot of limitations!They do need improvements dont they. probably because all it shows are the heads.I was wondering that myself!  They need to have different builds of bodies.. Maybe the program is not that advanced yet.  Hopefully it will be in the future cuz i know I have a little meat on my bones!I'm glad you asked , i hope yahoo is listening .You could always get a real photo of yourself and use that.That's a good question! I never thought of it. . . YAHOO MANAGEMENT! If you're listening, please make the avatars more personal. Like create/add more noses, mouths, eyes, eyebrows, expressions and so on.Great question?  I want to know the answer.
Wikipedia and Google!!!! Copy Copy paste paste!!!! Got it?Because they troll Yahoo! Answers and only answer the questions that they know the answers to. Plus, people ask really retarded questions that ar easily answered. Like yours!they don't. they r computer geeks. they know everything about answering questions. they r born that way. u want to become one too? get nerdy.You know, I was wandering the same thing.no they dont ,if they knew answers to all the Q's they would be doing better things in life rather than answer these Q's many of which are stupid, dumb and senseless. it even surprises me people ask such mundane and senseless Q's.. well as far as the points are considered .. the people who get the most are those with no work other than while away their lives answereing others Q's and trying to garner points , while their own future is a  big question marks !!!They probably READ a lot about all different subjects... and have a broad knowlege base.They are probably the best BSers you will ever meet in your life.  If they can convince somebody they know the answer, they get the points.  Or...they have multiple accounts and they vote for themselves.  I thought about that.They are very lonely people ! lolI think the world is being taken over by super-pseudo smart cyborgs that operate on a diet of Yahoo and crack cocaineIt's being well informed about stuffs and know how to play your game wellno one knows all answers..you already know that..cmon..That is just insanity.
To completely get rid of your Yahoo! Avatar, go to the Avatars homepage and click on "Preferences" in the upper right corner. There you'll see the option to delete it.What the person above me said.click on your avatar and they will show 3 choices.click the one that says no avatar.what the person above me said. he said what the person above me said, so the first one i guess
change it in the Options Section..Go to your e-mail, and on the top ( should be under your name and press account info! or something like that ( mine is in French) and change it from there!
I see this question listed, but if you can't, there won't be any point to asking or answering it. Anyway, have you tried clicking on your name on any Yahoo! Answers page, and looking under the "My Questions" heading? They should show up there.what was your question ?I can.  SEE !!!! lolWell, I can see this one!open your eyes or order a brail computer. do they make those?huhh ok well i got to go ask that one ok by thanks for the points
Shakespeare said "brevity is the soul of wit". It's either that, or Attention Deficit Disorder.Well I know he has had a little surgery. How do I know? Well obviously he "nips" and "tux."I would have to agree with Jimbo, Georgia & stillnocouch.  I think they all had part of the answer.No I think he is afraid if he starts pontificating he will never be able to stop.His answers are so short because he doesn't need much of the alphabet to convey his mojo.  ;)Speaking on behalf of Mr. MoJo, it is necessary to understand that due to the vast popularity of his wisdom, his answers, in the interests of fairness, must be translated into many languages.. . This takes time, so brevity is paramount.can't think of anything dumb or witty.....I might come back later to this one....lolHe uses the K.I.S.S. theory, Keep It Simple Stupid.That is a guy for you. Short and right to the point.Maybe he is just gaming for points? Where is Bearded Jimbo to report him?Yes I've heard short runs in his nature ;)maybe he just wanted 2 point's, like me..........who?his answers are short and sweet i love itHe spends a lot of time on his questions.  He doesn't have the time for petty answers.  FAH i say!Step one, I recommend 2 aspirin, excuse me while I go get them...  . . Step two,  Find out what he is doing with his time and if you like it, ask to do it with him.. . Oh and may I add that the brevity of your keystrokes just keeps me on edge. Not everybody can do what you do with the English language. . . That's why I say thank you..........no no. quite the opposite. men feel the need to compensate for that particular shortcoming, resulting in big long questions, competitive answers and a desire to have more points than anyone else.. . really, my gosh, sometimes you crack me up!He probably have made a wrong contract with Yahoo and he doesnt have enough space for his answers.. Many times happens to me, when I start to write an answer after..because they can be...his tuxedodermis is very thin alsoBecause he is straight, and to the point.For some reason I keep thinking of Honor Blackman's role in Goldfinger....Mojo does remind me of James Bond, "shaken not. stirred."Thats probably not the only thing he is short on....LOLHe wants my mojo,so he shall get it. Ok,I give him access to my Friend's list,but only for a trail period of 30 days.But I warn the public,he will start something like a filibuster.
click Toolbar setting (pencil like). select "Clear my recent searches". Goodluck ^_^You a program called Window Washer by Webroot this will clear all your history including registry and things you don't want seen by prying eyesYou don't clear history in Yahoo you clear it in your browser.. If you are using Internet Explorer go to TOOLS; INTERNET OPTIONS; GENERAL, then click the "Clear History " tab.  In Firefox got to TOOLS; OPTIONS; Then Clear All Entries.  In the new version of Firefox Options has a tab to "Clear Private Data"  One of these should work for you.
at the bottom of ur yahoo messenger, u will have an icon showing smileys. click that to view a number of smiley and choose the one u like from that list.. it will be added to ur send text box, not as an icon but as a code(for example for a happy smiley the code will be :) and so on)... click send or enter to send the smiley.  You can also insert the smileys by typin their respective code in the box, if u know them.just copy - paste the pictures    hh
It depends on the manner by which you sent your message.  If you use MS Outlook on a MS Exchange Server, you could get a confirmation when a user has received or read a particular message.  If you use Web-based email accounts like Yahoo! Mail, there's really no way of confirming.. . As for the first issue of recalling a message, you could recall a message on an MS Exchange Server, but the recipient will be prompted about the recall.  Otherwise, there's no way of recalling a message except if you call your recipient's/recipients' ISP product support and have them delete the message that you sent... Good luck with that though.  There are privacy regulations that prevent them from tampering with correspondence.. . My suggestion is you apologize deeply for missent email instead... Good luck with that, too.Go to Sent Item folder, Open your sent out email. Go To Action Menu, there is menu of "Recall this mail".. . It able to recall that mail if the recipient not yet read it. Nothing can do if he/she already read it.The both are not possible, lets hope someone will come with a idea to do that in the future. If they can give a conformation that the mail saver has sent the e-mail to the recipient, I don't think why not someone can come up with a idea when the recipient opens the the mail(click on the mail) so the sender can get a notice to let know that the reader opened the mail?!That depends on what provider you have for sending mail. Outlook has a function that let you recall mail if it has not been . read and also can notify you if your mail has been read.. If you have another provider, I do not think you can do that. You. can purchase a service called "read notify" that will notify you when mail has been read, it gives the time it was read, how many times it is read, approximate location of the person when your mail was read. It cost about $19.95 annually, but you can download and use it free for about a month.You can't recall an e-mail. Once you send it, your boss will know what you truly think about him.
stop whining ass holeDepends what the error message is.  If it says at the end Error 1, then you are probably stuck with the same problem as I have had for 2 weeks now. Hard luck. Try another email service.
I think they're having a problems with it today. Just wait a bit, and try again later."beta" = still in the testing stages.....yes yahoo tests their new stuff on us.......so there is still alot of teething problems, you have the option to revert back to you old email at the top of your emailBeta is slow and has lots of problems. Go back to the origional version.

You're not the only one. Think it's a Yahoo glitch.it seems yahoo mail is down... who knows when it will be back up... not me
Try checking your Internet option settings. Have you got your isp set as default? and have you checked the setting Always Dial My default connection? If they aren't then this could be you problem.Since the new mail I have been getting wrong user name.lots of reasons server could be busy or your pc could be messed up or the site may no longer exist
When is signs you on, click preferences and then uncheck the box that has you automatically sign in.set your preferences in messenger, so it doesn't pop up when you start up.. when you are logged into messenger, click on messenger at the top, then click on preferences, another window will open, on the left side click on general, and at top it will say . "When I start my computer" under that it will say . "Automatically start Yahoo Messenger" uncheck that box, then click OK at the bottom of that window, and it should stop Yahoo from starting when you start up your computer.you have to sign in...under the messenger tab...select preferences and under general, uncheck the box that says sign in when i start my computer...hit apply and you should be all set.Yahoo Messenger will only come up when you are on the internet. What you may be seeing is Windows Messenger, especially if you run XP. I found this to be a problem so I disabled the Messenger: Click on Start, Control Panel, Add/Remove Programs, and when this is loaded, on the left side click on Remove Windows components. That box sometimes hides behind the Add/Remove, so look for it. Scroll down until you find Messenger and remove the checkmark.
you can go into:. messenger, preferences, click on "alerts and sounds" on the left, in the box, find "I recieve a message on yahho" and uncheck the box that says " showing a message at the bottem right corner of my screen.. . that should get rid of it.it will only do it when you are signd in to messenger . if you are not signed in then you won't see it

After reading all the answers to your question, I feel really pissed! I thought we'd all get a new car or something! I think I'll sell my points on E-bay to the highest bidder! "Who wants to buy 18 points? No?"There's no point, really. But it'd be cool if you could exchange your points for prizes.. . You hear that, Yahoo? I answer questions, get best answers, you give me stuff.  That's the way this should work.. . ETA: *reading* What? A T-shirt? Wait a sec...earlier this week I got 3 best answers on one DAY. Where's my T, darnit??Personal feeling of accomplishment.having determination to get up to higher levels.The higher your points are, the more you have accomplished.... It's a forum and through different answers, you learned . and making you more knowledgeable of other subjects unknownst to you before. And it is a fun to do.They once offered key chains and t-shirt for earning 3 best answers within a week or something. Other than that nothing. May be they send you yahoo coffee mug when you get 1 million points.If I have more than you, then I am clearly better than you. Sorry, dude. HOWEVER, if you have more than someone else, then you can treat them like lowlifes.To show people how many questions you answered and asked.To make it more like a game as sort of a rating system for usersPoints encourage participation. The more points you have, the more questions you can ask and answer.To know where you are.No point. They are worthless.There is no real purpose.  It does give you an idea of how many questions are answering though.  Its kinda funSimple. . The more points you get the more accomplished you feel! For best answers you get, it makes you feel good to have helped someone.to get lots of them and then you have more questions, answers and ratings you can do in a day . thereby wasting more of your day - it is to count the seconds you spend in here i s'posevanity./
they use the guest facility and their own passwordIf it's Yahoo or Hotmail (for example) they only have to say they are not that user and then they can sign in as whoever they wish! Try it yourself, imagine you are not you, look at what the screen offers you.Which email account are you talking about? Do you mean a web based account such as yahoo and hotmail or do you mean outlook on your pc?. . If its a web based one then you just use thier login details (username and password). . If its for example your main email for your isp on outlook then you need to setup a mail account in outlook using the other persons pop and smtp details which you can get from thier ISP.. . You need to give more details of what you require and which email you're talking about.If you are the main account holder can you not make them a sub-account?Go direct to their email account from google or yahoo! They should be able access their web based mail that way.please elaborate problem. Not clear enough.
LOL. Somebody was searching naughty stufffffYou could probably just hit the history button up on your toolbar (it's the one that looks like a clock with a green arrow). A side bar will pop up, and you can just right-click and scroll down to the delete option.. Oh, and here's some other tips that my friend told me one day...If you have a Google drop-down toolbar, click the down arrow by the G and choose View History, then there's a clear history option in the bottom right hand corner of that history box to get rif of anything you've searched on Google.  Also, to get rid of the Temporary Internet files (images you may have picked up)  go to tools at the top when you open the internet, choose internet options at the botton, and select Delete Files of the buttons in the middle row.. . Hope this helps!
Associate this with that. No name. I wonder how we can help.do,nt know
If you are asking 'Can you add a friend when they are not online?' then yes,you can the next time they log onto their messenger they will see someone added them and either block or accept you but if youre talking about Yahoo msn you can only add people from Hotmail Msn,Yahoo msn,and sbcglobalok.. but what is your question?if u know theyre yahoo id then u should be able to go into add contact and type in their id there, when the coime online they get the option to allow or block ur requestYou can "invite" a person when they are not online.  They will get the invite when they get online.  Whether they accept or not, that's on them.
Click on My Account under your ID. Verify password and you will see where it says Change Password.You can get a new password, a Yahoo! ID reminder, or both. Visit the Sign-in Problems page and supply some basic verification information, such as your birthday and the ZIP or postal code you provided when you registered.. .

They have a option that says switch back at the top of the page.  Just select that."SWITCH BACK" BETA MAIL has been f@cking up everyone's e-mail (with log in error ) "LOOK AT THE TOP of the BETA PAGE" next to (SIGN OUT) AND (MY ACCOUNT ) is (SWITCH BACK), click it  "OR" Log out or close the Beta Mail, re-open Beta Mail. . IMMEDIATELY when you see the “bouncing ball guy”, click the RED X (STOP) at the top of your screen. This prevents the log on from going any further.. . under the "bouncing guy" is a link saying “Trouble Logging In?”. Click it. You will see" SWITCH BACK". . "BEST ANSWER"STo be specific, there is a link that says "Switch Back" (not necessarily the most intuitive naming) at the top left of the Y! Mail Beta page. It should appear just to the right of the Y! logo and directly underneath the "Welcome, [your username]" greeting.
Its probably to help prevent spam.  I would put up with it if it meant less spam.This is the only way to curtail spam when you do it.
Go to your My Account on top of any Yahoo! page and click the Change Password link.I'm using LOGINizer to create and change all my personal passwords.I like it. . Very simple indeed. Check it out: http://www.Loginizer.comlook on top or log on to www.pepsi.comon what?
The computer can see the file but it`s not in the right format to playIf you are on Messenger 8, try unselecting the Launchast plug-in, close Messenger, open Messenger, and activate the Launchcast plug-in again.. . If that doesn't work, check to make sure your firewall is not blocking communication to/from Launchcast in the Messenger app.. . If your firewall is OK, you could try uninstalling Messenger, rebooting, then reinstalling Messenger again.i dont know it doesnt work on mine either nither does the voice thing
Email him or follow my last answer. Stop wasting points, people see your question.You can't. that's not possible for you to see other people's information. You can only see your information. Otherwise that would be like invading private property.
You can't edit or change your ID. All you can do is create a new account.You can't edit your yahoo id, but you can edit some information about you except your birthday. Go to mail and options, and account information.Sorry u can't do thatU can not change ur Yahoo! id. Bcoze none of the srevice providers including Yahoo! offer this option. Instead the wise thing for you is to just leave that id. and open a new one of ur choice as it's free. However, if you want to change the other information like password, birthdate, place, country, etc., u can do it. Just log on and click on "My Account" link.
u can't just erase the searched key words .. u have to delete the whole Internet history.. Go to tools then Internet options then in temporary Internet files , delete files then go to settings - view files then ctrl+a, delete. this will erase all the temporary files then click 'Clear History' this will be fast . If u try to clear history first it ill take time & the temporery internet files will be there someone else can open it with its help   byeeeeeeee:)Well if you're talking about the little google search bar on top of the page (in Internet Explorer 7) there should be a "clear history" button on the bottom right hand side, just click on that and it should clear the history.done some stuff you don't want your parents to know about, huh? okay. first you have to go to the view thingy in the top left-hand corner of your internet browser. then go to the explorer bar, then history. right click on the things you want to delete. that's step one. then, to get stuff the list of googles, just type in some random things.tools ,internet options,general tab.clear history.
maybe your computer has a sense of humourI have my bulk mail set up to filter spam, and I have additional filters to send the crap that gets through that to the trash.  Since these e-mails still come to me, I used to get notified even when they weren't ones I would see.  I turned off the notification function due to the annoyance.What email in box are you talking about?  The only thing i can think of is the person/people who sent the message deleted their account before you could read the message so that makes the message non-existent.try clicking refresh when you go to mail
Bottom left hand corner of computer screen click on start then click on control pannel then click on add remove programs click on internet explorer and remove it!That last one was just a stupid answer, as she said she did that. Would you answer one thing so I can know how to help: does Internet Explorer still show in the Add/Remove window, and can you still run IE.. . Mozilla would never give you this problem ;-PI did the same thing and the message: internet explorer provided by yahoo, was still there.  If you uninstalled you have gone back to Version 6.  I had to edit my registry to get rid of Provided by Yahoo.  If you don't know how to edit the registry, just ignore it.
People have the right to view all English Speaking countries. Its not up to you to tell them where they should be answering questions at.Unfortunately, that would still leave me stuck with your stupid questions, most of which involve diarrhea. I wish there were a way to pick "All English Questions Except Ohiogurl's".Most likely the same reason we go in and ansewer theirs.There is no way of knowing where a person is from all the time.Look at someones info.Not a sign of where their from.I suggested to yahoo to have a country flag for each persons country or state so we could ansewer questions we know.I get tired of telling uk to go to lowes,just as much as they hate seeing it.Everyone ask yahoo q-a team.Or when you make youe name add -uk  or -okSad that you have opened a can of worms for no reason at all. . It is so easy to ignore someone that makes a comment out of ignorance.. But you have crossed the line and instead of ignoring it did exactly to them what you do not want them doing to you.. YA is open to everyone and they have just as much of a right to answer questions as you do.. I try not to do it but there has been times where I have incorrectly answered a question that was asked by someone in another country and I miss understood it and answered it with something that would apply to Americans but not to them.It's the World Wide Web, anyone from anywhere can answer your question. Most laws are generally the same. If you're asking a question on here, you're getting other ppls opinion and hopefully their first hand knowledge. If you don't like an answer ignore it.Yahoo is actually run by BT British Telecom.  Yanks thinking every thing belongs to them again.you need to find something good to right about dont you!!you must not have much to do in the U.S.A!You cheeky so and so...you Ohio types need our wisdom and we are here to give it to you. You should be grateful.. You should be glad that we even allow you to use the World Wide Web since we invented it.It's optional to just view your country's questions and not everyone who views All English questions are inconsiderate to the fact that they may be answering questions from another country. If I just answered questions from my country in the categories I frequently browse, I don't think I would have many questions to answer.  I take into account that I am answering questions from users in other countries.

They don't cost that much. If you can't afford one, then you don't need one.go to their website and ask for oneCigarette companies always give them out at night clubs, and events, just keep your eye's open next time your out at night... I've got 4 so far this year, 3 Marlboro, and 1 from Camel.Join the British navy & get posted on a brand new ship.. . They issue Zippos to each crew member when the ship is commissionedwhy does every kid in the world on here think everything in life is free?  if everything was free....why would we need jobs, money, an economy, businesses, etc.. . save your money and buy one.....they are only $20 bucks for a basic one...like that will break the bank.. . parents hand money and buy their kids too much junk and it teaches them that stuff is free or just given to them.  sad sad world.
I did that once, too.  I felt terrible because I really wanted to give a thumbs up.  I could not find any way to change the rating.  Maybe someone here has a solution for both of us.i don't think you can. i've done that and i couldn't change it.Can't.It's not possible to change your rating once you've chosen one.Once you rate, it can't be changed.You cant. I wouldnt worry about it.You can't. Sorry, looks like someone's not sleeping tonight.
can't... or look in customre supportI agree with these peeps above.. I don't believe you can set up Outlook for your yahoo email unless you do pay for a premium account.. I have Outlook myself, and I use it for my main email which is through comcast.
Yahoo needs a better system for reporting, any clown can just click and your question is gone.. It should cost 10 points to report abuse, then it may stop.. But will the people at yahoo listen.maybe your question was reported as abuse
Open yahoo main page find all yahoo services click on it find toolbar click on it follow instructions nothing to itYou will be offered it thru Yahoo, and when it pops up, click on it and it will be installed.  That is what I did.
That happened to me before. Must be a glitch in the software. Try downloading the latest yahoo messenger. Hope this helps!this has happened to me but only once or twice as far as i know. what can i say... no software is perfect
You could recompose the full headers in your sending. However send it as SEND only. If you Forward it it may retain the whole headers.By putting names in the BC window before you forward mail..Click forward as usual------this activates the mail allowing you to delete unwanted items and/or change whatever you wish. Highlight items and then press delete on your keyboard. Abracadabra !! it's gone.  Only the outgoing mail will be changed-----original remains intact.at is called trimming.After you get it in the foward mode you can edit and delete the subjet line and the total email body.Just delete the names and addys that are there.
Lots of problems reported with IE7 get rid of it.no but try againWorks fine with Mozilla Firefox.... might want to give it a try. Can't beat the price and it sure outperforms IE.

If you have windows XP get Pak 2 installed in your computerSearch information is usually stored in cookies (client side) or a database (server side).  Might try trashing your cookies.  Most browsers let you look through your cookies.  They will be indexed by site URL.It's a good idea to erase your tracks when using a computer, especially if it's a public computer. There are a couple ways to do it. First, from Internet Explorer, go to Tools / Internet Options / General. From that tab, you can clear your history with the Clear History button. You can also delete cookies.. . But you have to understand that this doesn't completely erase your tracks. There are still temp files, tons of files in the /Temporary Internet Files/ path, etc. You may have to purchase a third party product like.... . http://watersaffl.evderaser.hop.clickbank.net?tid=YAHOOANS. . ... to purge all that stuff. Good luck!Use your own log in for the operating system (windows) and nobody will know your looking at porn!

perhaps it is because you can't spell "here".  "here" to help.~~~I did not see your last question, but regardless,,,pay no attention to people who answer rudly,,,,,some people just like to annoy others,,,,I just ignore them,,,,but most people on here are genuinely nice and really try to answer to the best of our ability,,,,so dont take offence to those who are annoying,,,,they just are trying to get a rise out of you is all,,,,,,well SOME people on this site have nothing better to do with their time than to give negative, unecessary remarks, even though they really wouldn't do what they answer.. i believe you are a good guy, and you seem to have a good girl...so I wouldn't pay any mind to those haters and just live your life.. the bad guys sure do give other good guys a bad name, but as long as you continue to be a 'good guy' your girl will take notice and appreciate you for the guy you are.. . don't let them get under your skin, have a great day  =)Just ignore negative people. Their bored with their lives so they like to make others feel crappy.  Do what u want and ask what u want there are still good people out there who really want to help others out and give them helpful advice.  Good luck sweetie!
You can't, but it's about time Yahoo gave us the option. I'm sick of scrolling through answered questions in order to vote on one that some inconsiderate questioner hasn't bothered resolving for themselves.I myself want to but I dont know.Perhaps Y Q&A policy might solve this problem.What is the necessity ?. You cannot so leave it as such.I dont think its possible...
its because yahoo mail beta is more new and they want you to have it because its more new and they want people to use it allot AND I HAVE MAIL BETA AND ITS EASY ER TO READ MY E-MAIL ADDRESSES THAN BEFORE.because yahoo is testing a new format out...there is a link that you click that made it switch...the one that said Try Yahoo mail Beta...but once you are in there there is another that says switch back or something like that that you can go back to.  Your account saves which version you are using also, so you have to manually change it back, it wont just go back by itself.
call he or her send another!LOL jus for fun....Click on the "Trash " folder and it should still be there unless you "emptied" the trash folder.. If the message is still in the trash folder, click on it and bring it up then move it to a "new folder" or an existing folder.. I hope you find it and all is well.I think that cannot find again the message . Sorry i cannot help you .Hi,. Just go find it in trash! Easy.. bjsFirst, go to your trash folder. second, check the little white box on the left hand side of your message. Third, there are three Icons above the message at the top of the trash, [Delete] [Mark As] and [Move] click the icon  [Move]  the names of all your folders will appear underneith it. Finally click inbox. your done.If you haven't emptied your trash, you can go to that folder and see if it is in there...If it is, then check the box on the left of the e-mail, then go up to "choose Folder" and open that, then click on inbox...It should then be transferred to your inbox. IF, you dumped your trash, lhen I fear you have lost the message...Good luck! Sometimes your trash is set to empty on a predetermined time ( like emptied after one day, three days, week , etc.)
You can't unless you upload them to an offsite link and then link back to that link in your blog, and people can download the file.I don't think you can directly.  Since you have a YAhoo ID you have access to geocities.  Upload the files to your geocities account and put links to them on your 360 page.

Yes cannot get it back. Your only hope is that there is some error on the receiver's side such as a mailbox that is full or the the recipient's spam filter blocks it from their Inbox. But those are just possibilities usually with low probabilities.Unfortunately it is too late now, you can't get it back once it is sent.Pray for a floodIf you sent it, then your not going to retreive it.You can't, unless you can intercept it at the other end before it is read.. . Hope it's not too bad!Sorry, its too late.  It's just like when you send mail at the post office, you just can't get it back.You can get it back if your e-mail service provider has that special feature and if the receiver hasn't opened it, of course.  Usually only e-mails set up as part of employment have that feature, so if you are using hotmail or yahoo mail you are out of luck.  If it is a different service provider, you need to ask that provider if that feature is available.You can't.  Better start making excuses and practicing how to say sorry in many different languages.  LOL Sorry.You don't :-(OOps!  You can go to who you sent it to and catch their computer on fire.
It happens sometimes.  Just use the refresh button- it will become your best friend in times like this!I think yahoo is cleaning up or something...just wait...Happened to me too, must be yahoo's fault. just wait, it should recoverthis is a regular occurence now

Because Yahoo is situated in California and emails are routed thru their servers, the mail will always be displayed as Pacific time.. . At least until they decide to change it and figure out how.are you talking about the time in email ?  there is no way that I know of to set the time in yahoo mail...at least i haven't found a way anyway
Try contacting them through e-mail, look for the icon that say "contact [insert username here] and you can send them a message. If they have that disabled as well, then see if they have an open question and answer it with your apology (technically this is against the rules, but anyone who would report you for it is nothing but a troll). If none of these is a possibility, than I wouldn't loose sleep over it if I were you, it's sweet of you to want to apologize (and it shows amazing character) but if they don't want to be contacted than you shouldn't try, after all, it's the thought that counts ^_^If you know their name, just post a question with their name in it so they will see it. You might get reported for chatting, but I don't know what else you could do.why do you feel the need to apologiseI dont know but you sound like a nice person.  Very few of them on here.just leave a message after your questiondon't worry if it was offensive it was blocked before they got itI guess the only way then is to answer another one of their questions, nicely this time and use that oppurtunity to apologise.  There may be a better way, but I think that is the way I would go about doing it. All the best :o)Do they not have a way to contact them on their answers page?  I know I have my e-mail hidden, but I still can get e-mail from other users.  Maybe you should post a new question and apologize to them in it? . . "How should I apologize to user x, user y, and user z when I can't contact them?"  (something like that)The problem is that if you leave somethng at the question, someone might think it is "chatting".. . They have no email to send to? You may just have to pay it forwardDo they have a 360 page?. Other than that not much you can do.. . Do you have a 360 page? Post it there and maybe they'll come across it.  Broadcasting here is taking a chance of being reported for chatting or personal communication.. . . /docfind them in your q&a`s , click on their avatar and see if they have any open questions and leave an answer
Click on Options and then on Signatures. You will then be able to add one there.Sign into your mail box.Click on Options>Signature and do the rest.Thats all
click on pencil icon ,tool bar options, uncheck anti-spy.... norton only works/installs, if you activate it.       it will not be in add/remove programs   as it is not installed.Start. control panel. add/remove. norton. uninstall. That easy......
tell them the truth. Tell them your just friends and your not doing that. If they don't listen and it keeps on go a step farther. i mean if they aren't going to believe you why bother with them?A little jealousy showing through,maybe :)because they really want to be with her themselvesHow did this question end up under Yahoo Products? Anywayl, morons will be morons. Don't pay any attention to them as you can't do anything about what someone else thinks.
all you have to do is click on options then signature like the other girl said. It's really easy!Click on Options and then on Signatures. You will then be able to edit it.
its easy , go to My Q&A , click on Edit my Info and click on disply my picture and upload it . simple. . :)it allows you only if youre cute
maybe u cant see it but other people can. . or maybe u need to scroll upThere is a little lag time.Sometimes it takes a few minutes for the question to appear. There is a slight lag time. If numerous people have answered the question, your answer could be on a different page.
That was bugging me too. I had like 485 attachments and there's no delete option. What you have to do is delete the actual email message which contains the attachment. Then it will be off the list. . Delete in inbox, sent, drafts, bulk & trash. You must clean out all folders.We have  a textile – cloth?nag   company ,  we  have  been   lonag  t?me  work?ng   together a lot of  product?on .

That seems to be the HOT TOPIC for the day......I think we must have all been punished today...OHHHHH the question marks, don't do it....I figured that out after my violation this morning.....because they violated me for a answering with a question....and I was just being witty....so I thought....use "!!!" or "........." LOL. . . But no ???. . Whoops......I'm gonna be violated.....this is happening to everybody, not just you. yahoo doesn't decide who gets kick off, we do. when someone presses the report button, it automatically gets deleted, no questions asked. there is nothing we can do about it either.Yes i think you should have called her an old hag.  The more I read of yahoo answers the more i think the people running it are stupid. are you reading this stupid people? haha. I havent got violated yet, i wonder what it would take.. and then you have people who should get violated and dont, no matter how much people complain. doesnt make sense.hey lets all find a better answer siteSome people on this site are donkeys (polite way of putting jack.....) anyhow, it's the people who are reporting you not yahoo.They did that to one of my questions.  I asked where in Minneapolis could I find a sleigh ride for an upcoming trip and the reason for violation, according to Yahoo, was that it was personal communication.  So, whatever.  I think someone had a problem with one of my other answers (and I do get harsh,  but I call 'em like I see 'em) and reported my question.  . . Don't let it get ya down, just go answer more.You really can't do anything.  People report you when you offend their "delicate sensibilities."  It's very annoying.  You cannot even answer a simple Q without worrying that someone will just decide that they don't agree with you.  If people are that sensitive, they maybe shouldn't be asking complete strangers about their reproduction.. Peacethey probaly reported you because u offended them by basically calling them old.I had the same thing happen! I answered with a question (about 5 actually) because they didn't give enough info in their question for meto give a correct answer and they were removed!It just sounds like to me, if you keep getting them, and your answers are fine....that someones out to get you, or drive you crazy. . . I wouldnt worry about it, for now. You cant fight yahoo. Weve all tried.i dunno, try finding a way to tell the person that without insulting them, especially on a topic which i wont be able to answer myself or a controversial topic.
It says this becuase u dont have full access rights to your comp, as i think you would be sharing your comp. There must be another person, who has full rights. SO u have to either ask that person to loggin from his windows id to install it, or ask him to give u full access rights on your own windows loggin.If you are on a created account , or a guest account under the administrators name.you would have to have them change your account to an account on the computer in which you are able to download. Sounds like you are on a limited account and they are usually restricted from downloading and any changes made to the computer.You need to ask the person who owns the computer if they mind you downloading stuff.  Tell them what you'd like and either they'll give you access or do it themselves.An administrative account is usually the person in charge of the computer or computer network. If you are on a personal computer, it would generally be the person who owns it. The administrator has more privileges such as downloads. If you are on a network of computers, such as at work/school, you would probably have to do some investigating to find the administrator. Generally, restrictions on downloads are put on accounts by administrators to protect their computer or system from viruses, etc.. . If you want to download messenger, you will have to find out who the administrator is and get them to do it.Hi,. I've got the same problem. I modify the target directory where I can write, but the installer try anyway to put a fill in "program files" where I can't write with this account.. . Yahoo developpers team could modify their install script. For instance Skype install without administravite right without any pb.
I think you have to go to Internet options and click on 'delete files' its either delete files or delete history, im not surethere should be an icon somewhere on the browser click on it and so to the options and uncheck the ones you dont wantTools > Internet Options > Content Tab > Auto Complete Button > Clear Forms Button. . In IE 6.
They don't use rounding -- they use truncation. Much easier. But I do agree with you that rounding is easy, too.no, they just screw us on about everything....Better to round down than up. . Also, in a lot of programming languages the default variables for an integer round down no matter what and adding .5 to everything would just make the code longer and more of a pain to work with.  It's not laziness, just efficiency?
Are you at least 18 years old and going through Yahoo Messenger to get to the chat rooms? If not, thats the problem.Because you are 12. Go away.
1) Go the the Comcast page. 2) Tools/Internet Options/. 3) Near the top, your "old" home page will be displayed.. 4) Click on the "use current" button. 5) Click on OkayTools
Log into your Yahoo 360 page, at the top right you will see a settings link click on that. Scroll down on the settings page til you come to the primary email settings. On the right click the drop down menu and choose private. Save.go to settings (you can find the link on the top right corner of your page) on the basic info tab.. choose your yahoo identity. then save.
Unfortunately not. They empty the accounts when they deactivate it.you can not bring back your mailSorry, you can't get it back.  It was deleted long ago...  :-(
There are various different messenger programs, Yahoo do one as do MSN, you download them from the provider's website, create a login (or use the one you obviously signed up for to get on here) then you can chat online (when you're logged in). It's just another way of showing people that you're online.A messager is like chat room and a telephone,depending what kind like Yahoo,Google,AOL,AIM,Skype and suchInstant messenger is a message system much like text messaging but in real time. You can contact and communicate with other messenger users, exchange photos, use web cams all while online as long as you are logged in.something/body that delivers a message
go to the trash folder. If it's already been emptied then you are out of luck. I think yahoo keeps them in this folder for 30 days.If you deleted the mail, but HAVEN"T emptied the trash bin, it will still be in the trash. If you emptied the trash, it is gone forever.if you send it or forewarded it... there is a copy saved.. if u trashed it and emptied it... then you are out of luck.In the trash folder of your mail if you haven't emptied it yet. if you have.  I would send the person the e-mail is from a e-mail asking them to resend the information because you can't get it back any other way.Check on the mail and select delete.If you open the trash file and it's not there,  forget it.
yeah most of those places have a fee. try the last state/city or country they lived in. you can go to your local city hall or library. birth, marriage and death records are public info. there usually no fee to see them. it doesn't tell you where they are now but it's a start.you might start with the last place they lived in maybe the county court house has records that will help you. you can't send and e-mail to all yahoo subs it would get spammed
save them. on the email pages you find that option.your connection is timing you out abroptly. so got to save ur message. Also dont leave your message compose window idle or too long without doing anything.. . Also try to see if u got a virus on your PC, update and scan you computer.
go to your "SENT" boxabout thhrree below inbox is sentIn the new mail, it is pretty much in a similar spot as the old mail.. On the left, there should be a list of some folders, like "Inbox, Drafts, Trash, Spam, etc". One of them (directly below the Drafts folder) is a folder called "Sent". Click on that folder and a list of your emails that you have sent should appear
First go to the site www.yahoo.com. In the middle of the right hand side, there is a box that says "mail" click it. Another box should come up and you have to hit "Sign Up". Go From there....And the question is?. Just call Yahoo Yahoo.. Don't you already have a user name? If not just think of a nickname, activity, animal, or thing you like and Voila your Sprout_fisherman28 or what ever.https://edit.yahoo.com/config/eval_register?.intl=us&new=1&.done=http%3A//mail.yahoo.com&.src=ymjust go to yahoo.com and click sign up on the right side of the page
in what? Address book ? or make a new one?? PLease provide more details.clich the add . then type in the user name then they have to except that easy. ?
if u ask a silly question and give a silly answer on yahoo answers.. you will get marked down alot.. if someone asks you a serious question..answer it seriously.. if someone asks you a silly question..answer it seriously.. always try to help as if someone really MEANT asking that question..that way.. if someone who was not trying to be silly, but asking a serious (but wierd) question ..and u give him a silly and bad answer.. his feelings could be seriously hurt..so.. hope this answers your question! :Dif it is a lie, and you know it, don't answer it. and stop caring so much. there are a bunch of d***s out there. any where in life, you will run into this. they win if you leave, are you going to let them win?. i don't think that you will let will let them, don't let me down.I understand, and it's happened to me, too. I think it's happened to all of us. Just keep giving funny answers to silly questions and serious answers to the more deserving questions. Or, if you feel in your gut that you're being "set up", don't answer.Ignore the questions if you think that it is silly.ummm, my suggestion is either ignore the question or answer the question semi seriously and at the end say "thanks for the 2 points" i am annoyed by the people who ask questions that are already posted for example... in the tattoo forum "i want to get a tattoo, will it hurt" that gets posted about four times a day.ignore the problem. btw, this falls into your catagory of silly questions i think.i always chose best answer randomly, cuz i cant really judge which one is better than which.Answer them with an equally silly question and get 2 points. Just don't report them. That's mean-spirited. It sucks some people are just that way.Princess Grace, I agree with you 100%.. . It is getting worse that people post snide and nasty comments or degrading questions and when you answer in the way they do not like, you can be reported, as you were.  I was too and points deducted because this person asked another racially charged questions and I simply said, stop asking stupid questions like these.  I was told it was an insult and my answer was removed.  The thing is, there are worse responses, yet they remain, as well as those stupid questions.  However, I did notice that one rather degrading question was hastily removed, which I'm happy to see Y!A respond to.  It was outright racially degrading.. . The thing to do is to be bland in your response and not direct them at the idiot asking the question.  If you do not direct it at him/her personally, they can't say you insulted them or at least the censor panel cannot pinpoint that you actually insulted them because you said it generically.  . . Another thing you can do is "thumbs down."  These people want to see how many responses they get and they do not like the many thumbs down - one guy even wrote that in his question!  HAHA  It takes away their joy.. . And you can always ignore them, as I've chosen to do.  It spawns the frustration in me and I'm sure I will respond and let them have it verbally, which will get a violation and tick me off even more.. . <sigh> The bottom line is, as long as YOU are following the community guidelines, the people monitoring the site should see that your comment did not merit a "violation" whistle blow.  Whoever is pushing that violation button abusively should be cited and kicked off.don't answer themJust take the silly and stupid questions in good stride, Answer them just as silly and stupid as they ask them, but I try not to be mean, rude or use cuss words...I hope this helps you.check your Flux capactior and make sure Superman didnt swoop in your yard and take your dogYou just have to roll with it. I agree though, I sometimes post a silly answer to silly questions and I have also gotten a violation for it. A good silly answer I use sometimes is "sshhh, be vaarwe quiet. I'm hunting Wabbits""Just ignore it.You cannot allow a few to ruin it for a lot of people.  Some people are just the way they are and you can't change them.  Pray for them and keep on answering questions.  May God Bless

Put your addresses in the bcc area.  This means blind carbon copy.If you're sending a message to a bunch of people, use BCC (blind carbon copy) instead of putting everyone in the To or CC box. When you are composing a message, look for a link that says Add BCC above the To box. That will add another box similar to the To box that you can place your addresses into. Putting addresses there sends your email to everyone, but it only shows each recipient's email address when they receive it, instead of showing the entire list of addresses you sent it to.
becuase the vicar shags all the woman i suppose, or maybe the boys, there is so much of this happeneing. . its sadIt a rest day and all are invited to attend the Lord banquetLOL!!  I shouldn't laugh but thats quite funny, a valid point also. Maybe its so they can get it out the way to spend the rest of the day in bed!!!Beats me - I've been wondering that for years.  Didn't Jesus say something like "the Sabbath was created for Man, not Man for the Sabbath" ?. So that's what I'm going to live my Sundays by - resting my hangover while curled up in my nice cosy bed watching dvds heheCommandment #3  - Remember the Sabbath and keep it holy.

don't know how to put my picture up.Its not because we're unattractive, its just one more way of keeping our identities from public. And besides, avatars are fun for us girls, dressing up the cartoon, choosing the look that we think is close to the way we are in person,... things like that. I like using an avatar.NO they just don't want to stun too many people with reality.Maybe that or like me they don have picture of themself in the computerDon't know how to put it upBetter me "anonymous" as the advise for Internet users  go. There are plenty of good people out there but you'll never know if they are telling the truth. Women and children are vulnerable to these pretentious people. Be safe than sorry.I have an avatar because I've been stalked.  I once used my real photo and it was very modest.  Even so, it evoked strange emails and contact.  A man even called me from Flagstaff and said he was on his way to find me (about a 10 hour drive from where I do live).  I told him if he showed up I would call the cops.  After that I use only avatars and hide most of my personal information.  I am nervous.i think that cartoon avators are unattractive at all!i think that they are gret!look at me this is great!It's just a fun thing to do............dress up the avatar,etc.
Everytime you ask a question you lose 5 points and only get 2 points for answering. You answered 28 questions.... thats 56 points, but you asked 10 questions thats -50.

Maybe you're asking too many questions, and it's taking away from your points.plot...make a complain to YAHOO.very odd...when one answers a question, they are given 2 points.  First of all, make sure you are logged in.  Second of all, click preview at the bottom of the page.  some people will leave after that step but you have to then go to step 3 and "submit"...hope that helps
If I'm not mistaken those are saved via cookies.  The best way to clear things like that out is to go to Tools on the top of your screen, select the internet options and use the "Delete Cookies" button.let me know too...
Redo your password, making sure that the uper or lower case setting is right.  Passwords are case sensitive.  That is the most common reason for it not signing in.check out ur login id and password. If it does not help then check out ur internet connection. Lastly check out the proxy setting of ur connection.Bloody hell!! I got same prob since last nite! Damn u Yahoo... :)try again mine wouldn't but just hasI think it's a common problem 2 day, mine did log in but took a couple of minutes, when usually it takes less than half a minute.they r 2 main reasons 4 this. 1.probably u dint download Ur yahoo messanger properly. 2.there may be a problem with ur pc software. its better if u reinstall ur messenger againdon't change anything, it's a server problem from yahoo...many people have the same problem today, hopefully it will get fixed soon....
i had probs with this wen tryin to upgrade to the new yahoo mail.  In the end i just went back to the old one - alot easier n less hassleI had the same prob when I moved to beta but what a wally of an answer on here. . If you cannot get in how can you go back to the old Yahoo!!. Lemon!maybe... . you typed the wrong password... . or. . wrong username... . or you typed both wrong password and username... . or. . another option... . create a new account..
Lol, I'd like that too...Open your e-mail program and enable audible alert in the options menu. Minimize the e-mail program to the taskbar, and it will alert you when mail arrives.
You can go to control panel and choose" add or remove programs" and go to Internet Explorer and remove it and then go to their home page and find the download that you DO want and get it.you should be able to roll it back through control panel add and remove.. I have just had that done on our servers at work - someone "accidently" downloaded it and caused all sorts of heartache. it rolled back ok though

I wish they would put it back...Maybe if enough people will send comment they will change it back. You can send. a feed back , bottom of home page !!!!!I have to magnifi it 9 X justy to find it,I wish it would get bigger too.
It is a weblog. Usually people use it as a place to write how the feel about things and their thoughts. Other have taken it to a different level and have news reports, video and opinons. Like a mini newspaper. But mostly just personal thoughts and views.is a website where entries are made in journal style and displayed in a reverse chronological order.. . Blogs often provide commentary or news on a particular subject, such as food, politics, or local news; some function as more personal online diaries. A typical blog combines text, images, and links to other blogs, web pages, and other media related to its topic. Most blogs are primarily textual although some focus on photographs (photoblog), videos (vlog), or audio (podcasting), and are part of a wider network of social media.Just like a diary...you can add pics and daily info about what you've done that day, photos, just anything you feel like puting on there that the other members might find interesting...you can have it visibal just for your friends or for public view. If you start one....don't put any information that might be risky or misused. You can always hide or delete your blog. Take a look at some of the other 360° pages of other members' that will give you an idea what it's all about.Its a collaboration of your thoughts and ideas or even experiences that you want to share with others or get feedback from.its a electronic diary to say what you did in the day or where you went etcIt's an online journal. The word comes from [web/log]... You can post about anything that's on your mind, your hobbies, politics, etc.
Seems to me that my buddies say no, it can't be done. I think they also say that it often depends on how soon you've added them to your collection, and if they have just updated their page and put something new on.You have no control over where your friends show up on your list. That is determined by who has updated their page the most recently. If they don't do anything with their page...they will stay towards the bottom of your list. If they update in any way..they move up. If someone is STAYING at the top of your page...then they most likely have Feeds on their page...and when working properly..Feeds update regularly.
right below your question is a bar. on it is things like grading the question up or down.  and email question.. on the far right is a thing that looks like a pencil, just hold your cursor over that, and you will see a box come up to chose what you want to do, chose extend question another 4 days.I  had the same question.  Here is how you do it.  Below your question there are several Icon...a thumbs up and thumbs down etc....there is an Icon that looks like a pencil..the last icon on the right.

Underneath your question is a group of icons in a horizontal line. Hover your mouse cursor over the pencil icon until a menu appears. Choose the option that says "Extend expiration".
You're not adding points. All you're doing is going back to previous page, you're points have alredy been loaded onto your score.. I know it looks like it!Asking questions COSTS you points, it does not give you points.Oooh I dunno.  I'll try that!  Bet it dont work.. . U silly billy!  Of course it doesnt work.  U think Yahoo didnt think of that?You're not actually getting any more points... watch your total, I'll bet it's not going up!

Some people pay no attention to details.  Like the details after a question.  It's really annoying.I can't believe some of the questions that actually get on here at all like: I haven't had my period in 9 months and my back hurts. Could I be pregnant?Stupidity!One idiot asked about urinals & put the question in "Food" catagory. StUUUUUUpid!!some people don't like the categories that have been chosen for them.
Buy itYou can buy it off e-bay at a reasonable price.This is all included in the Norton Systemworks Premier package. It is a little expensive  but gives you a whole range of features which are really good.. .

Blind Carbon CopyIn all Emails it means blind carbon copy. This means when you enter an email address in that bar the persons ID will not show up after you send it. However there always has to be at least one persons name in To Field.It will say undisclosed recipient after you send.
The browser homepage that you want to see every time you log-on.Its not what browser you open to, seeing as you either just have to click on IE or Firefox.. Instead, if someone sends you a link either on an instant messenger or somewhere else, it will open in your default browser. :D So whichever one you prefer to use most, set that as your default.................... MEANS WHEN EVER YOU SWITCH TO INTERNET ............ FIRE FOX WILL COME WITHOUT SELECTING ............... you can change it also later .............. no big deal .............Default browser is the one that comes up everytime you click on your internet explorer...it is something that you can change if you want to...mine is set for yahoo, but if you need to change it right click on your explorer icon and click on properties, thats where you can change your default browser.  Hope this helps you!
Maybe b/c it's spyware. You should be careful. . . I recommend NOT doing it.Is your computer on a server system?  Smiley Central (among other sites) is often blocked by servers.
soft bouncing usually happens when a mailbox is full or something temporary made the email bounce.. . hard bouncing usually indicates that an email account has been closed.. . The group owner or moderator can send a "reactivation request" and usually receive back the reason the email is bouncing.Check the Bounce History of the Bouncing Member.  The last line on the page will give the reason the mail bounced back to Yahoo.  . . In my experience with bouncing members, hard bouncing is sometimes _but not always_ a permanent condition so do send reactivation notices and wait a while before unsubbing any members.. . Hope that helps!
You will still get advertisments if you are using the free service. The only way to get rid of them is to upgrade to Yahoo Mail Plus for $19.99 per year. This is the same in Yahoo Mail Beta and regular Yahoo Mail.I don't think you can. Looks like it's part of Beta Mail and the main reason why Yahoo!Mail can be kept as a free service.
Unfortunately, you will not be able too. It is a hard lesson to learn about passwords. Write it down somewhere.Try a free product offered by Loginizer.com. to manage all your Passwords and User IDs.. It helps me a lot.. . http://www.Loginizer.comyou can't open it!!!!! well my friend told me that he can open it but i forgot how (way too complicated than my brain could afford lol). . next time, try to write it down or make a simple password that easily to remember will ya??
Just re-register with a different namesame why you got your 1st one.www.mail.yahoo.com. . https://login.yahoo.com/config/login_verify2?&.src=ym. . and click Sign Up. . then fill the information.Go to the Yahoo sign in page and create a new identity with a new sign in ID and you will have created a new email address.  It is actually so simple to do that people think it will not work.

Click the button next to the answer that says "Choose this answer as the best answer" that you want to choose as the best answer, then on the next page, choose the rating and write a comment.the stars are only given if the person who asked the question choses the best answer.and yes you would get 3 points cuz u chose a best answer for your question

hm??Don't think you can, love. Tried to do it as well, maybe if everyone who cares emails yahoo then they might make it happen. I know that they've added maternity wear and babies to the listing so maybe they aren't far off from doing that as well
download it by going to this link http://messenger.yahoo.com/ or go to yahoo.com and click on messenger button.First, you go to the yahoo homepage. Then you click on messenger, and it is quite simple from there.
go to history, then scroll through and delete things you want erasedTo clear the yahoo search bar, go to the pencil near the search bar and a drop down box appears.. you will see clear history. that will clear everything.Someone's been looking at porn....
Get a 360 account and post pics then go to q + a in edit info and pick it.You can set it up by going to Yahoo Avatars. . . http://avatars.yahoo.comGo to your profile and click on to edit it. There will be a place where it says "no picture" but where it says Avatar, click on that link to get one. Once you work out how to design your picture and get it all done, it will show up on your profile! Took me a while but I finally figured it out!
at the top of the yahoo! home page,click my account,then change passwordIf you mean your Yahoo password then go to you account options:. http://edit.yahoo.com. . and click change password.
Yahoo! just send out automated emails...I've found them useless with technical problems.. . Have you got many photos on Flickr?...You might just have to create a new account with your Yahoo! ID...A lot of hassle,but that's all I can think of.If you actually state that you want help from a human, they might be able to help. However, if you joined via a third party PC, it may not be possible.. . Try Yahoo.co.uk for advice.I’m not quite sure what your problem is - but I think you may need to click on the 'old skool' (their description) link if you aren’t using your yahoo account to sign in to Flickr.
Some ugly man hater probably reported you because shes never had a ssshag sympathetic or otherwise.If you want to define abuse and profanity type in AFATNINJA into search,click on it and see what he has been getting away with for the last two weeks and even though he's now off here his questions are still there. Questions? Abuse and lies I meant.To define Profanity in itself is "Vulgar or irreverent speech or action".. . Well now to answer u as u have raised the question that yahoo said that ur question contavened yahoo guidelines. This is really surprising now. The same thing happened to me as well, I had asked does size matter while making love? and in within 2 minutes i got like 42 answers. So, we can assume now, this question really does have meaning. And one more thing, yahoo allows adult chats, it even allows adult profiles, it even allows nude pictures to display in profile, then why do yahoo does not allow to ask and answer us something 18+ contents.. . Yahoo in this case mus be sensitive. There are several questions in the mind of customers related to sex and adultery which they cannot ask open to everyone. So, I think this is the right forum where yahoo must allow to ask all sorts of questions. . . And yahoo deleting such questions is not fair at all. And friend, other thing that I realize is, if some dumber FU**** report abuse  to yahoo, I think without seeing the question or answers, they simply delete it. This is simply bull shit. . . Anyways, cheerup man.Many people here ahve no sense of humor, so that gets you into trouble.. . Personally, I find the term "shagging" far less offensives than many of the other euphemisms that could get employedsome ppl report you just cause they are bored.  Move on don't worry about itThere is no rime nor reason here
Never get over that fear!!!!!!! Unless it's a well known company, then try to steer clear of them. Especially these overseas companies on these auction sites. Most of them are scam artists just trying to rob you blind.I have bought things overseas and 1 time the product never arrived but since I bought it with credit card they refunded me the money.. . Many people are leary of using credit cards but it's actually safer.  If you have a credit card I bet you it has a money back gaurantee.  Also you can get a paypal credit card free and paypal at http://www.paypal.com has a good secure policy.Don't shop online unless you know the company and you know that it's reputable. Too many online "shopping" sites are just scams, and you have no way of complaining or getting any legal compensation from someone in another country.
If you have Yahoo as your main source as your "ISP" and they require you to have a credit card number and you have paid them before, I would call them to set up another account. If your using another service just to set up an email for your daughter, you can simply create another email just for her with yahoo or another email service.. Say your ISP is Verizon you have made payments to them before and you want to request another email for your daughter. Simply contact Verizon etc. and ask for another email account for her. But 9 out of 10 ISP's have 3 emails for you already.. Otherwise don't give out your credit card number to anyone untrusted or that you haven't used before.It is just for verification when you are trying to get an email account for a child under 13. It won't be charged.IT'S NOT!!!. . Never Never Never.. . Do not do it!!!. . Yahoo e-mail accounts are free even for kids! Why would they need a credit card number? It really sounds suspicious. I've never heard of such a thing. I really would dig really deep to find out what, why, and how they need this. It could be a third party.. I advise, personally, against it.how old is your daughter?. . theres an age limit.it is not don't give your credit card information to them. you have a yahoo account why not get her a yahoo e mail address for her.
Add their address on the block address list by clicking Mail Options, Block addresses, enter their email address, and click add. In the free Yahoo! Mail you get 500 free block addresses,Add her name to your Block list, you can find that in your "options."Maybe just tell her about this problem and try to work it out about this thing.Go to options and remove her name from you favorite list, her. emails will go directly into bulk ~ ~ so set up your bulk mail so you can just empty it, all mailings that are not on you contact or. favorite list will go into bulk.  Just empty.. . That's it.
you cant.. I cant figure out why you had to get a new Yahoo account though. they have nothing to do with your ISP. you dont have to pay for a Yahoo account. did you try to log into your old one?no way u cant move ur points. what u only can do is changing the appearing name and pic of ur old yahoo answer accountYou can't transfer points from one account to another. But I don't understand why you can't just use your old account. It has nothing to do with a computer, I've had this Yahoo email for years, before Y!A even existed and 2 computers ago.
There are those times when it does. We all even get kicked off sometimes. I`ve been playing for years and nothings changed.You may need to delete your cookies. Go to Tools, then Internet Options, clear history and delete cookies. This ought ta do ya.
rt click on open area of tool bar,click customize  remove what you want.  rt click the v at end of search space,click options,click more options,uncheck the boxes.go to customize
Some websites you use have a box on your senders pg.to mark with a check for this purpose. If they don't, unless you get a reply from the sender, you can't tell.If you think I answered well...please rate it,,..,. . I wish Yahoo should enable this feature...but as of today its not available.
I agree.  There must have been some employee that needed to prove that they were doing SOMETHING to earn their pay.I agree and so do many others. Im also glad they put all the old settings back. It was terrible looking and not easy to understand.
Theres an option to turn it off.  Also, you could just highlight the search and hit deleteit depends on the browser you're using. theres usually a button in the tools section that says clear all private data. or go to tools>internet options>clear history. something like that.if they're on your browser's toolbars, click on the pencil logo (for yahoo) and choose clear recent searches. for google toolbar, click on the arrow next to it and choose clear search history.use the Help function on your browser menu bar to find the answer.This has been asked many many times.. Just do a search in yahoo questions.  you will find your answer.Go to tools click on privacy options then in the menu go to click on clear now or just click Ctrl shift delete
In the case of Yahoo Messenger:. You need to have a Yahoo ID to Sign In into the messenger service. Once you Sign In click on Add Contact icon and add your friends Yahoo ID. (In the latest version of Yahoo messenger you can add your friends MSN ID as well.) Once you add your friends ID, Yahoo will automatically send an invitaion to your friend to accept/reject your invitation. When your friend accepts your invitation you should be able to see his ID on your contacts section. Double click on his ID to start chatting with him.. . In the case of MSN messenger:. Its the same as Yahoo messenger. The only difference is that to Sign In into a MSN messenger you dont need to have a hotmail or MSN ID. You can sign up for Microsoft .NET Passport and use any of your email id as your MSN messenger id. (In MSN messenger 8.0 also known as Windows Live Messenger you can add your friends Yahoo ID as well.). . In the case of Google Talk:. Its the same as the other two messengers except that you can only add people having GMail IDs.. . Finally, in Yahoo messenger you can connect to any of the public chat rooms and chat with random people who have the same interests as you. The other messengers stated above dont have this feature.. . For more details visit: http://messenger.msn.com & http://messenger.yahoo.comif you have people on your contracts list and they have an yahoo id then just click on there name and send an im. but if they dont have yahoo im cou can only send an e-mail. invite them to get yahoo im
POP3 is the way to go. One thing to note though, there is a setting in outlook to have outlook leave copies of the mails on yahoo server. If you don't set it then all those emails would be downloaded to your local machine and removed from yahoo, and there is no way for you to access your emails from outside your machine.You cant download it, into outlook.

I would make it up and click save and it never would save it and still show the gray smiley face, right?. I noticed every time it had the manage add-ons icon on the bottom of the screen and so I turned all of them off and started to enable them one by one until I got it fixed.. What you need to look for in the Tools column in the Explorer toolbar is manage add-ons and look to see if you have Macro-media shock active x add-on if you do and it is enabled disable it or if disabled enabled it this active x is what runs the save thing on the avatars on my PC. Maybe yours too hope I helped!
by not sending msgs do you mean no graphics or the whole thing?if it is the whole email let me know i might can find the answer for ya. TessIf its yahoo your having problems with then I have the same problem my yahoo ID ain't sendin mail.It could be multiple reasons. One, if you haven't logged in for over 4 months(doubt this one), it shuts off. #2:If you are trying to send to another e-mail server, it sometimes won't work. #3: you could be spelling the e-mail wrong.. . More Another time...maybe because you havent been on for many months and your computer might have somethingYou might have to pass the character string test. i can never get my email to send messages because of that test. It doesn't matter if I have it exactly right, I can't ever get through. I just go on messenger and leave offline messages, that works for me.

because younger people dont have much common sense and they could arrange meetings with predators or anyone that may harm them in anyway.I have it and I'm under 18 now freaks don't come get me!!you can lie. thats what i did. i put in my dads b-day when installing, he let meThey Do Silly!Yahoo had problems recently where there have been some preditors going after young kids.. . Apparently there are people who have sued yahoo over this, so in order to protect themselves yahoo has made chatting in rooms for 18 and over only.. . They did this to protect themselves from further law suits.You can have a messenger under 18. However according to yahoo rules and regulations, the CHAT rooms are 18 and older only. Unfortunately alot of kids lie to get passed this and all it will cause is problems for those that use it correctly. Meaning yahoo will eventually do away with it altogether to avoid being sued over and over again.becus of older people who are going to abuse them.

Answer as many questions as possible and try to give good answers so yours is picked the best. You get 10 points for that. In the early stages you lose points by asking questions.You need to answer lots of questions as well as voting..What is a leel?. First you have to say here leel.  Jump boy.. Then hold some Bacon strips high in the air and your leel will get your leel to jump up.  Or if you talking about your other leel.  Just look at a pretty girl and your leel will be up.  . So I hope that helped you some.  Now go out there and get your leel up!. CHUCK. :--# )stop asking questions and answer more questionsYou get a lot of points by answering questions.spell correctly.. . Aw, I'm sorry -- I'm sure that was just a typo.  I guess it's a pet peeve that so few people edit what they write.  Is this because we're in a hurry to gain points?  To what end?. . Why not use this forum to share your knowledge and find answers?Answer a lot of questions, don't ask a lot, and vote on best answers.Answer, Vote, Rate and most importantly, pray to get thumbs-up!
it's just for fun!noI WANT THE MOST MINIMUM POINTS...NEGATIVE..... . POINTS ARE POINTLESSI think the more that you use it, the more points you get.It is just for fun but everyone here enjoys the competition. And it seems to be addictive for some reason. Go to MY Q&A and you can get all the info and an explanation of the point system.i have thought about this too and my answer still remains: i have no clue!We all are greedy for something or the other.In Yahoo!Answers! there's this point system so that people take interest in this new feature and at the same time acquaint themselves with better knowledge...Afterall,that is the purpose of this feature...To maintain balance. So that you coultn't just keep asking questions without contributing to answer others' questions.
It just happens.it might be bad luck, or maybe people just don't know the answer. i have a couple of those two, but they were technicle questionsBecause some questions there are no answers. People like to answer stupid questions or easy questions. Not many people actually stop and think.Because some are easier and make more sense to the majority.Because less people know the answer. I think if the questions are on the front page, more people will answer. Sometimes, people just don;t find the question or don't feel they can answer. I had a question on for about 3 days before anyone answered it but it was a bit of an unusual question. I've just looked at your Qs with no answers and I can't help wit ha single one of them! sorry!ditto. . Much be the luck of the draw...they don't stay up on the screen very longi looked at your questions and since they don't interest me and i don't know the answers already to them then this is the only one i'm answering. sorry but i don't feel like digging the web for your homework answers right now :-(maybe someone didnt know the answer to your question or they didnt see the questionMaybe because people are not intrested in the questions that you post and people get more responses than others because their qustions intrest people.

If your email address is actually sending out SPAM, it's likely that you contracted a trojan virus that has taken over your email program (Outlook?).  If that's the case, you need to run a good virus scan.  Another trick to prevent future issues is to put an entry into your Contact list named "AAAAAA" (so that it's always the first) with no email address.  SOME viri will stop when the contact doesn't have a valid email address, thereby preventing it from sending to all of your contacts.. . However, if you're just seeing spam come into your account (and others') but there's nothing in your sent folder (assuming you have your software to save outgoing messages), it's more likely that your email address has been spoofed rather than actually hacked into and used to send SPAM.  If that's the case, not much you can do.  Sorry.What I think you are asking is how do you prevent someone from "spoofing" your email address as the sender on spam emails, even though they are not coming from your computer or your email account?. . You can't.Change your pass word often.. . I bet you use AOLget the virus or malware out of your computer maybe?don't spam anyone, and if it's a virus that's sending out the emails from your account, there is no way to stop it unless you get rid of the virus!

Something seems to be currently wrong with it.  Instead of the hundreds or thousands of questions, it has stored, it is saying there is no data currenly or giving just one or two of the qurestions.. . I tried Bush, for example, who is mentioned one or usually more times a day and NO questions.  Hope they figure out it's broke and fix it.it kept saying no data available, but there's like 13000 search result.. when we go to the next page the data existed, but only one appear, the rest is just went missing... yahoo please take notice of this problem!Yes, there is a little glitch in the system. I just asked this question myself. I always go to the search bar to search for questions and the question I always look for doesn't show up. Or If I search for other questions, it says like 5 pages available but only shows 1 or 2 questions. Hopefully this problem won't last long.Can you please tell us what you searched for?  thanks!I usually find what I'm looking for when I search...

It isn't at all up to the person answering the question, but more so up to the person asking.  I believe that the person enquiring is simply biding his/her time to see if there are going to be any better answers.  Some people are quicker than others on responding.  Patience is always a great thing to exercise when one is dealing with any computer or science related matters.sorry but you,ll never find out unlessWhen a question gets answers, the asker has the option of putting it to a vote, and may do so before it automatically goes to voting.

You can go into settings (top right) and set your preferences for these.. . Also, they may not show up when you are viewing your editing page.  You can check how your page shows up to others by selecting the 'preview as seen by' box and using the drop down list (private, public, friends, etc) and clicking the GO button.

(you need to verify your email, show that you've created 360 page sucessfully etc.)
You sign in under another name and check to see if the person's screen name appears to be online. If they are, but do not show up on your regular name, they are blocking you.Create a secondary screen name but don't tell anyone.

All you do is you enter their email address, and then they will check for you.You don't unless they make it obvious. Why should you care? If they want to stay clear, consider yourself fortunate. If you know why, learn from it.They won't answer your IM's !Do you mean added to ignore list? It is impossible to ignore bud.

personally i think yahoo mail beta sucks. and i hate using toolbars. and yes u r not pointing in the right windowokay. I tried this myself after looking at your question. well, you cannot disable keyboard shortcuts to yahoo mail beta. (not yet i guess) and if you are having trouble to use yahoo and google search bars, its because you are not putting your cursor in the search bar before you click on the keyboard. check it out. Cos when i did it without putting the cursor in the search column the keyboard shortcuts are working but when the cursor is in the search bar its not. so its as simple as that.

What you can do is stick them in your junk folder and you will still have all those messages.Create a folder with a special name that will allow you to know they're messages that you would have deleted but chose not to such as: For later review (or something like that).Once you delete e-mails or messages, they are dumped in your trash folder.  And yahoo is specific in stating, messages in trash folder are subject to deletion at any time.  . . The best way, if you want to save these wanted e-mails or messages, create a folder. Go to Yahoo Mail Page.  Locate the MOVE toolbar.  In here you 'll find folders.  Label them with creative names as I have, intimates, or stuff.  Forward these e-mails or messages over to that folder.  This way you're assured of their safekeeping.  . . When my computer had a virus and shut itself down automatically x3 weeks. I lost all my files and documents stored on the desktops.  But the folders were saved.If there is any doubt you want it, do NOT delete. Maybe have a folder marked "Maybe=maybe not" to look thru once a week.

Hi, I put out a Question about 10 min. ago and within 5 min. my access was back ... maybe Yahoo Helpdesk is monitoring this Q&A page -- it appears many other Yahoo users are having same difficulty opening their email this morning...if Helpdesk is tackling a big problem, maybe they are able to do small selective fixes based on those of us who are complaining & wanting to use email NOW --- but want to also tell you that my separate email messages are SLOW TO OPEN now -- further indication that the server is undergoing some form of maintence or restoration of files.  I sure hope it is only a Repair situation -- I'd hate to think that scheduled Maintenance would actually be done during a business day... should be done 2am EST not daytime or busy evenings.Hey there ,, i am in florida .. had same trouble all day today so far ... was fine last eve  .. checked it around 8pm  last eve was fine... . good luck.. hope Yahoo fixing the trouble
this is a regular occurence nowWell i do not know as well,maybe there workin on it.Just refresh the page a few times.  Works for me!It takes awhile for them to show up at YA. Be patient.
That's sexist to assume that someone with short hair is a male.  Maybe yahoo is trying to encourage people to make their own avatars.this has recently been implmented by yahoo. i have no idea why but it looks like its here to stay for now.The icons for people without a avatar are now defaulted to be a male picture, regardless of their gender.
Go to the myspace home page, then at the top click "Search." They give you the option to search for their name, display name, or email.

Send a beta feedback form to yahoo explaining in detail what is missing.

every time you post a question it "costs" you five points, . when you answer a question it "earns" you two points. get a best answer and it "earns" you ten points. choose a best andswer and it "earns" you three points.. . There is no deduction for an improperly formed question, all questions "cost" five points.it really makes no difference anymore.  It could be the most perfect question in the world but if a troll decides to report it, then it will be deleted and you will lose the pointsThat may be close to impossible.. . Keep it fact-based and watch the language problems.. . I avoid speaking in slang and keep to the facts.
Some jerk reported it for a thrill. Then yahoo removed it, which is stupid. If theyd read these reports, it wouldnt happen so often.I was at level 5 and Yahoo terminated my whole account without any explanation.  I can't even use my email on the old account.Some people just seem to enjoy reporting questions and answers whether there is anything wrong with them or not.  . . The sad part is Yahoo simply deletes them.  They don't read the report and the question or answer to see if it truly is any kind of violation.It depends on how long ago u asked the question. I think each question gets a 4 day limit.

Not intentionally - but some one must have reported it and Yahoo. deleted your answer. it might take a while before they notify you.. . Or - you posted the answer - wanted to edit it - and then did. something wrong. Instead of "submit" edited question you. clicked on "delete". It can happen.. . Try answering the question again - if it says - You answered. this question already - than you know something went wrong.. . Other than the above explanation - I don't know!No clue bud....must be somethin with your computer....but how can that be possible....I just have no clue

Because people who ask questions are too lazy to select a Best Answer. That means the rest of us have the chance. And if there's a tie, the question remains unresolved until the tie is broken. Which often doesn't happen, because if the question is more than a week old no one will bother to read it.~~~Sometimes someone may ask a question, but mabey is away from their computer for a couple days,,,,,or mabey they are waiting for more answers to their question.  I know for me personally,,if I ask a question,,,then mabey I am super busy at work and then dont go on computer for a couple days the questions I ask are still waiting for me to choose best answer,,,,,Questions can be resolved after four hours. Maybe after that time, the answer someone isn't looking for isn't there.  If they take longer to choose the best answer, maybe they were waiting until they saw their best answer appear before doing so, or they wanted to weigh up each answer and choose based on a criteria they selected.  . . Questions that go into voting can take longer, and I imagine this is what you're talking about. Voting initially lasts for two days, and the best answer is chosen as the answer with the most votes.  Sometimes though, there is more than one answer voted for, and more people need to come along to vote to give one answer the most votes. However, they don't come along frequent enough, or if they do, there's a tie breaker. Tie breakers last until one answer has a lead for 12 hours.Some questions are hard to answer, and some questions really don't earn an answer.. . If someone asks, "Why are ducks?". They won't get an answer, but if the same person asks, a microbiology question, it may take weeks to understand and solve the problem to supply an answer.. . Davesome askers ask for extensions on their expiration, some askers don't feel the need to pick their own best answers and leave it up to idiots like me who are level 2 or higher and can vote on which answer we find most informative.  Sometimes all of the answers suck.. After your question has been posted for four hours, you have the option of resolving your own question by picking a best answer yourself.
Go to the top of this page, and sign out.. Then you will see a page that says 'Return to Yahoo'. Click that, and then you will get the option to 'sign in', or 'sign up'.. Click 'sign up', and then enter your daughters details.Set up the account for the daughter like you would set one up for you..Just make a new id and password for her.
Reverting is simple. On top left of the Mail Home page click the link "Switch to previous version".I think you can only do that when they are still in the beta version of the new one. Once they have tested it and they switch us all to it that option is taken away. :-(there is a "switch back" link located beside the "sign out / my account" links..I had the same problem. It's becaus it is the beta version and not all the bugs are worked out. There is a link on the top right hand corner next to sign out and my account. try licking that. If it doesn't work I would try again later. Thats what i did
Hit the Spam button. It will Block that address for you.Go to mail -> options -> block addresses.Next time they do... mark it as spam.. . Or, go into your email preferences and add their email address to the block list.
yes, i know, it is only points.don't snap.Well there are certain individuals and even bully coalitions of scousers who band together to single out and attack various users whose answers they don't agree with.  Yahoo doesn't police every question, If they did about 3/4 of the Yahoo Answers content would be deleted, there's an abundance of profane language, vile insults and mindless tirades that are tolerated.  Somebody has to have it in for you enough to take the time and effort involved to report you, oh wah!You mean points DON'T make prizes???can't get the points back, but i think what annoys people is how many points they take. I thought 12 was bad but a guy on here yesterday lost 24!because its ruined my lifeYeah, chill out! :o)because they have 0% tolerance.trueYeah but its the principle of it, at the end of the day shouldn't the internet be uncensored and a place of free speech?Long live the violators, we have a proper good laugh on here ginge, while the miseries are getting wound up enough to report us! keep it comin hun and i will too!Maybe they got the impression that they can turn in their points for a car or cash or something!WHY DO YOU CARE?  I LIKE GETTING WOUND UP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Like you say the points are, well pointless but the abuse that some people are allowed to get away with is not something to brush aside. At times if the people that said these things were able to be identified they would not say them because it is only because they feel protected behind their little pc monitor.
Your Yahoo home page privileges have been revoked.

Yes it makes some difference. Sometimes I'll avoid a question if there is a freaky-looking or offensive avatar up there.. . And I know this is really lame, but I am more likely to answer a stupid question if they have a cute avatar.. . I don't mind the default avatars that much, but I've noticed they generally don't pick Best Answer and often go with fake accounts, so answering their questions is usually a pretty thankless task.Yes, I believe they make a difference. For instance yours is that of an older man, if I were a teenage girl I might think it odd that you were answering a personal question that I may have posted.no I like to look at how different ppl design their avitar!!Not really. Sometimes I may see one that looks like I think the person may look likeSome I guess through stereotypes and whatnot. We probably assume what we see has some relation to what we're reading.

I just keep adding the junk e-mails to my spam list.  It does a pretty good job at filtering out the junk.  There are programs out there, such as one from E-Trust, that are good for content filtering to be able to get rid of the junk you don't even want in your inbox.THATS    CALLED  "  NIGERIAN  SCAMS" GO  TO   WWW.GOOGLE.COM   AND  SEE  OR   WWW.ASK.COM  ..ASK  WHATS  NIGERIAN   SCAM  ARTIST?Check the box to the left and click "Spam".Report them as SPAM.  Better yet..., just delete them.  Seems the more you block them via SPAM reporting the more you received.  Don't open, just delete.  You know who sends you email, therefore you can  usually delete them without fear of deleting something important.  Also notice the subject line, it's usually the best clue that it is one of those types of email.  Or challenge the sender to respond to the question of "why"...Doesn't stop them, but I stopped receiving as many.If anyone could come up with a fool proof method of filtering out junk mail, they could make themselves very wealthy.  Junk mail is here to stay, sadly.  You can invest in filters, but most times those aren't so good (sometimes they'll mistake your Aunt's email about her recent visit to the doctor as junk mail, and you'll never receive it).  I'm afraid we just have to grin and bear it.  Spammers have no souls.delete them

Another reason for this is that they need login data from users to follow their trails to capitalize their business form them, consider you often visit the Yahoo game site, then yahoo staff would like to know about when you usually get in or where you use the service from  in order to appeal to their clients who want to promote their businesses.Check your internet settings (enable cookies, etc) and when you sign in, make sure the "remember me" box is checked.for security reasons
of what??you should edit this question and tell us what you are trying to turn off the background music cause from what . . turn your speakers off
I don't think you can unless you change your name on your profile for example if you put your name is stephen it'll say hi stephenyou have chosen the option to save your e mail and password. that is the reason. go into your e mail account, and press sign out, and then sign out completly. this should solve your porblem. when you save your password, yahoo is smart enough to remember you and your password.Delete your cookies. It knows who you are because you signed into yahoo. Deleting the cookies will basically sign you out of everything.. .just sign out of your e mail
Hello,. How are you?. . Since you are talking about spam mails, i would like to share some information with you. Suppose someone sends you an e-mail anonymously, and you dont know who that person is, you can easily trace him out through his ip address.. . There are many people who try to send anonymous mails through SMTP servers, but they dont know that their IP address gets logged in the e-mail and they can be traced.. . For knowing the senders IP address, you need to open the headers of the mails, this can be views through clicking view on the above menu, and then view headers. This option is available on netscape browser and outlook express. Now if the mail is abusive you can complaint the cyber crime ofice and tell them the senders ip, he would be traced shortly!!. . For more details, please purchase a book written by ankit fadia, the unoficial guide to ethical hacking, i have got this book and provides amazing information.. . hope this information is useful to you. . Thanks . VisheshWhat is the email addy?contact your internet service provider. they can track it down.No, not really, but you can block them, so they don't get to your mail box. Check your internet prefrences. they have a place to block e-maill addresses.  And the idiot will be gone.
That was bugging me too. I had like 485 attachments and there's no delete option. What you have to do is delete the actual email message which contains the attachment. Then it will be off the list. . Delete in inbox, sent, drafts, bulk & trash. You must clean out all folders.I asked the same question with no responces too, i figured out that the attachments are also in your "sent" folder, delete them in there and they go away from the " attachments " folder automatically, but you have to have " save sent files " turned off, but there will be a screen that pops up asking you if you want to turn if off so you dont have to search for it.. . Good Luck
How are you getting IMs when you're not logged into IM.  Something is hinkey.. . mhm.. . Being F on the WWW makes you a magnet for weirdos that send IMs blind, just because it is free/easy and there is always the chance you're just "invisible."  If you don't want to get IMs, don't sign in or add people you don't want IMs from to your IM ignore list.Go into Messenger then preferences and customize your I.M. Also you can be signed in and be invisable by selecting in my status.
you cannot, you are stuck with them for life.ive asked 3 or 4 i think and ive answered about 10 but i only had 2 best answers i think...i only joined like a moth ago tho...They go into your permanent record and follow you for the rest of your life.Ya, can't you're stuck with it.  Unless, someone reports your questions as violations, which will cost you points.. . /docYou can only delete questions that are still open.  You will loose 5 points for every question deleted, and 2 points for every answer you delete.  Although the questions that you answered that you delete will be removed from your profile, the questions that you ask will remain on your profile although you will be the only one to see them.

It's kind of like the coffee machine at work.  Sometimes it gives free coffee, then I get at least 2 at each break.  When I have to pay I won't touch that swill.  . Sometimes you get a break.Must have been a bug when they were only deducting 4. They've fixed it now.. . Don't despair - there are plenty of other bugs out there for you to find!A glich in the matrix.I don't know what planet you were in for a couple of days.  But it has always been 5 points.If you got a thumbs up for a best answer while you were asking a question, the point is subtracted from the five points taken from you while you are in the process of submitting your answer.   I know the other week I got 5 points for asking a question, but that was because I received 10 points for a best answer in the process. (-5+10=5 points) . . If you ever notice anything "different" about the points that you earn, view your recent activity.  Click the "My Q&A" link, and click the "Activity details" tab. It will list the last six actions you gained/lost points for.
Where in yahoo! When u sign in on yahoo just click invisbile.There is a box you check on the sign in box. good luck.On your messenger at the top there is a word says messenger click on it and there is where you sign on as available or invisible good luck I had a problem with this along time ago so it isn't a dumb question
Because it's easier to type in if you look for it again.  Stored search words and such can be cleared if you don't want them to be saved.u set it that way, maybe not intentionally, but if u have kids its a good thing. u can sut it off by goin to   the menu bar uptop, click TOOLS, INTERNET OPTIONS, choose the GENERAL tab, go to BROWSING HISTORY, SETTINGS, and choose NEVER.. . . then to delete the forms that are being saved, do the same thing as above EXCEPT for choosing SETTING, choose DELETE.
An answer you gave offended someone. The answer was removed, you lost 10 points, you got a violation notice detailing the incident and you have a (terrible) opportunity to defend you actions (terrible as Y!A doesn't really care what you have to say about it)Someone reported you or your answer got a really rating...someone must have reported you earlier.  Everyday, before i log onto Y!A, I check my email, and it says (if i get one) that i have a violation on community guide lines.  so when i log onto Y!A, where it says Hello ???, total points, and what level your on, mine says.  Alert your down 11 POINTS.  That's why.  And so you know ahead of time, check your email.thats so weird....but not a clue
first thing first ---look at his profile. if he doesn't have one (which is impossible), try asking/requesting for his contact details. if you are really worth the effort, he'll send it to you--with his yahoo email add included.Ask him or ask a friend of his to tell you.. . You can see if he has his name on Google and his email address is listed online.. . "put name inside quotes" +city

To the left of where it says welcome, K K or (your name), run your cursor over the box and then click it. It will take you straight to the same avatar page as it would in yahoo answers!

Cc: stands for "carbon copy." Anyone listed in the Cc: field of a message will receive a copy of that message when you send it. All other recipients of that message will be able to see that the person you designated as a Cc: recipient has received a copy of the message. To add an entry in the Cc: field, click the "Add CC" link above the To: field.CC means carbon copy. BCC means Blind carbon copy.IT MEANS CARBON COPYcarbon copyCarbon copy.. Mail sent to more than one person.Carbon copy.  It's a holdover term from the days where carbon paper was put between sheets of typing paper before a memo was typed, before Xeroxes and printers.Stands for carbon copy- which dates back to the days when typists used carbon paper to make duplicates of letters, for files, or for multiple copies being mailed, before copy machines were invented.  If names are inserted in the CC line, these people will also get copies of the email that you have written.  So if you send an email to Frank, for a lunch meeting, but want George and Harry to know you're contacting Frank, you'd put their names and addresses in the CC line and they'll get copies of the email you send to Frank.Back in the "Dark Ages" before computers letters were send by snail mail.  They were typed on a typewriter.  If a copy was to be sent to another person, the writer would type CC and then the name of that person at the bottom of the letter.  CC stands for carbon copy.  It's a hang-over from the days when carbon paper was used ... the days before photocopy machines.Carbon Copy.... if you type an email address in that line, that person will receive a copy of the email you are sending. . . BCC is Blind Carbon Copy meaning that if you type an address in the BCC line, that person will receive a copy of the email you are sending but their email address will not show to the others who received the email.Carbon Copy.. . This is a hang over from years ago when actual paper was used to communicate.  The CC said that a carbon copy of the letter (a duplicate) was sent to specific people.. . BCC denotes a Blind Carbon Copy.  This is used to send someone a copy of an email without letting the main receiptant (the TO: box name) know that they got one.. . Hope this helpscarbon copy......another person your sending it toCarbon Copy- this means that you sent it to the main recipient, but then you send a "copy" of the original to others either to show that an e-mail was sent or to make others aware of what was sent out.

Go to My Computer - Programs "ignore the warning it gives you its just a liability thing" find the file its in just browse around or look in the IE file- when you find it send it to recycle bin and empty. Oh yeah before ever deleting an Internet program you need one to replace it a good one is Avant. {Avantbrowser.com} It is a free program and constantly has updates. It is tabbed, has a great pop-up blocker, you can move the tool bars wherever you want, and you can turn off about anything that can be displayed, and many other things. If you have any problems e-mail me at guyverX2008@yahoo.comIf it still shows in the Add/Remove Programs window, you really should have a qualified professional take care of it. Because the way to solve it is a hard one. One wrong move, and your computer could stop working.

well i had to do thast once too a couple of years ago. Press the right click buttom on it and if all the stuff you searched pops up on a list then click delete all.. . If that doesn't work then exit multiple times and each time check till it works.(maximum 6 times till works minimum 2).. . If that doesn't work then close the computer after you close it but if that doesn't work then you're stick with it.Here's what worked for me. Double click the search box, all previous searches should appear. Highlight whatever you want to delete, hold down SHIFT and then press delete.
go 2 the deleted fileHi,. Just click on your trash bin (left of your opened mail box) and check mark  the ones you want.  Click on the move drop-down list and click on inbox.. Glad I could help.by not deleting them. just let your mail hang around and throw parties in the trash folder. they won't bother you there and if you are looking for something you will find it. . . Bur no, you can't retrieve it
I agree with the other answer to this.  You need to reread their regulations.  They don't just take questions off for no reason.there may have been something offensive in there sometimes its not what you say but the way you say itYou can appeal their decision but it takes time. In order to have a question removed it either does not get an answer within the appropriate length of time or you have been reported. If you are reported an e-mail is sent to you setting forth the reason for the deletion. I would think that your question expired without answers if you have not received a notice from Yahoo.It may be that you need to go over their "regulations" again and see what could possibly be the  problem."fascist"? ;-). why don't u look through the community guidelines once. u'llprobably find ur answer there. and don't question Yahoo!, they can do whatever they want. GOOD LUCKBeats me? Try rewording it. I asked "boxers or briefs"? and they removed it , then I asked "Which is better? Boxers or briefs "? And it went through.Please, give examples, so I can tell what the problem is.  I have heard so many people complain about this stuff, its not funny...
u wanna make money like i make every month from doin offers go to this site http://www.cashcrate.com/index.php?ref=4685 and do what i do to make 400 a monthI totally agree with you. Must be some computer glitch. I had 2 I put on the list and they are still getting thru. Report it to Yahoo if possible.
I agree with ashylee. Don't forget to write you friend's email on the TO: space and make sure you hit send.Click compose when logged in at the "My Mail" Yahoo! page.
You can't send it to somebody. They would have to download it themselves.The first thing is Yahoo messenger is useless if the comp is not connected to the net. And if ur fren's comp is connected to net then he/she can download it from the yahoo page. u dont need to send it.  Yahoo messenger is a free program and is freely available for download.u just do
I did this one time. Can't remember the link. But it you type in " Treminate Yahoo Account" It gives you the link.

If you look at the format of the question...it is broken down into segments with a percentage....a computer does it.. I'm guessing these key words are aligned with others to see if they fit a criteria for violations.. It's too bad Yahoo doesn't explain it.Yahoo doesn't monitor the question forum.  They rely on users to "police".  the board.  Basically, some uptight moron got pissed off about your question and reported you.  They automatically remove it without bothering to investigate.  It's a terrible system that is facilitated by lazy, useless, third-world workers and abused by overly zealous "Christians," political fanatics, and total arseholes who get a kick out of revenge.Removal is rather random, I think it is based on who they like or do not like.Their functioning system seem to have been messed up for a couple of days or perhaps someone did like your question.  I think a lot of the problems are the people on here just don't like some questions so they get rid of them.  My opinionAgain, any question on why, who, how  ....its anybodies guess.
Also check whether you have number lock or upper case lock switched on either when you typed in your password originally or now. Also be careful on foreign language keyboards the position of letters may get swapped around...........if your account has been stolen, there is not much chance you will get your ID back as all original info will be changed and although yahoo says it recognises original info, THEY DO NOT, as once the thief changes the ZIP and primary email the recovery process anywhere though yahoo is useless. . . Some will suggest you lock up the ID by multiple sign ins, this is useless as the. thief can still get the ID in on another countries server. . DO NOT SIGN INTO ANY LINK THAT IS SENT TO YOU ON MESSENGER, EVEN IF IT IS A YAHOO SIGN IN PAGE, ALWAYS ENTER YAHOO THROUGH THE YAHOO HOME PAGE. . now after all that feel safe clicking the link i'm posting you to . read about what happened to you ID and how to avoid it happening again, and how to recover your ID..  IF POSSIBLE....  http://www.freecreed.com/userid.html ....  .... . Yahoo address etc... Yahoo! Inc. . 701 First Avenue . Sunnyvale, California 94089 . Phone (408) 349-3300 . Fax (408) 349-3301 . Office Hours 8:30 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. PSTIt sounds like someone has accessed your account and changed things around.  It's not wise to share your passwords with anyone.  . . Also, you must be careful when using a public access computer.
Go to the email address's profile and if it doesn't have a name on there, you really can't, unless you're like with the FBI or mafia. Check the profile.yahoo people surch..( maybe ).  good luck.
Click the scroll arrow right of search box.Click the scroll arrow right of search box and then delete historyUninstall the bar and install again.. Delete all temporary internet files.To clear the yahoo search bar, go to the pencil near the search bar and a drop down box appears.. you will see clear history. that will clear everything.Uninstall. Then leave it unistalled.. . Problem solved for good.
Simply merge the photos into a single Gif or JPG woth paintbrush, photoshop. etc.Anywhere you want a picture, use this code:. . . <img src="URL of Image" alt="Caption for image" height="" width=""></img>. . . If your image did not appear, troubleshoot it below. --If the image is on your computer, you must first upload it to a website, a universal host. I use Photobucket.com, but there is also Flickr.com and I have heard that there is a Snapfish.com too I think. They are all free . . The reason for this is that if you link a picture from your computer, for example C:&#92;mypic.jpg, . Anyone else who goes to the page; their computer will look for C:&#92;mypic.jpg. and because their computer does not have said file, it will not show up. If you upload it to a universal host, it will read "http://mypic.jpg" and since both computers have access to it, they can both view it now. . --if your image ends in html, it's wrong. You're linking the PAGE it's on, not the image. Right click the picture, and click properties. then copy the url and use that. . --if you have not defined height and width, take it out. otherwise they will have neither. And if it's 0 high and 0 wide, you wont see it. . DONT FORGET TO PUT THE HEIGHT AND WIDTH IN BETWEEN THOSE QUOTATION MARKS UP THERE !!! AND YOU WILL HAVE TO SWITCH THEM AROUND OR YOUR PICTURE WILL COME OUT SHORT AND SQUATTY! SO WHEN YOU RIGHT CLICK ON THE PICTURE YOU'RE WANTING AND THEN CHOOSE "PROPERTIES"...DOWN WHERE IT SAYS THE HEIGHT AND WIDTH...SWITCH THEM AROUND BEFORE PUTTING THEM IN THE CODE. FOR EXAMPLE: IF IT SAYS IN THE PROPERTIES OF YOUR PICTURE THAT IT IS 162 x 227...............BEFORE PUTTING IT IN THE CODE ABOVE...CHANGE IT TO  227 x 162 AND YOUR PICTURE WILL COME OUT RIGHT!

Anytime you use the back button or leave the email open for a period of time, Yahoo will ask you to verify the login. I don't think you can change it.Man, I have the same problem.  Isn't that irksome?

In Outlook, you would create a Rule (Tools, Rules and Alerts).  Other systems would be different.  Check the Help on your e-mail system.. -MMthere should b a forward button and then type in the yahoo email
If youre talking about the comments you leave after a answer, you just go back to it and VIEW the comments.You don't. When I send a message I make a copy of it, so that I can look back at what I sent.

Maybe this is the problem if there is nothing to click on
wish some one answer ur question, becuase i need to know it.The easiest way to delete web history is to go to tools, internet options and click on delete history. This is the best way.
BASICALLY NOTHING AT ALL. JUST A WAY FOR PEOPLE TO TELL HOW MUCH YOU PARTICIPATE IN YAHOO ANSWERS. THEY ARENT GOOD FOR ANYTHING ELSE AT ALL.Points encourage participation. The more points you acquire, the more questions you can ask and answer.
No - You can not know if they are online and have offlined themselves....there is a smart way of doing it.. . . double click on the name of the person.. the yahoo messenger window will appear..and then do a direct buzz.. and if they are chatting to some one else.. and ignoring u .. u will come to know as it will show typing a message in the window :)you can't. If a person is "off-line" they are either off-line, or invisible because they are in hiding. Either way you can't tell...unless you can read mindsLet me explain this to you: when you open up Y! Messenger, you expand the contact lists on there. You'll see a dark and sleeping face. That indicates your Messenger contact is offline. When you see a bright, smiling face, they're online. That's all to it.Come to online and add me i will explain how it happends. My Id is altimadhu fast. Now i will go out
Once you get used to the new 360 you'll like it much better.  Give it a chance.  Is there a feature that's not working for you?  360 allows you to blog and share all sorts of things with your friends.  don't be so quick to kick it to the curb!Go to your 360, and change your Settings.. . At "Yahoo! Identity Display," choose the first option "Display me as: ______," instead of the ones that replace your other Yahoo! things with your 360.I'm SO glad you asked this question- my daughter had a 360 page which I monitored (she's 9) - but she and I decided that it wasn't the right thing for her so I deleted it...but I didn't know the correct way until now- I just went in and put a bunch of bogus info. Thanks for bringing this up!
[I'm sure your going to be reported]. It's because its 7h30pm new york time ... all bored kids are here now, and in Europe only a few sad adults now ...i dunno what your talking about. you mean pathetic, or sorrowful?Just so you could ask that sad and boreing question.. You half witt,go boil your headWell i used to wonder why ppl went on about Americans and the lack of a sense of humour, irony etc , but last night i was online quite late as i am tonight , yeah i know i need to get a life, but i was enlightened as to why ppl have this impression of Americans !! . . OK i shouldn't judge all Americans just by the ones that were on here last night but boy something went wrong somewhere !!because the yanks are sadI'm watching The Aristocrats on Free view Film4. Mostly American comics.Suggest you put it on. and you'd find the difference between our(British. humour)and there's.coz Americans do not have the same sense of humour as us Brits!. we may post a tongue in cheek-TIC- question they may find offensive, whilst we laugh our b00bs off about and reply in the same , TIC way! . . They, however, will be offended and state their opinion!. each to his own!yeah mate! all of them are inbreeds with no sense of humour!You most be scared because you didn't put down which sorry place you are from.. . Also, if it wasn't for the Yanks, you Limeys would be speaking German and eating Wurst instead of Bangers.Because all the Happy ones arent online hun.Not sure, but they do make good comedy...sex in the city, desperate housewife's, even nip/tuck had it's funny moments!!  I just think people are wary of the 'can't say that...that's kinda racist' etc....or maybe they just don't get our jokes?!  Not making excuses...................!. . Hey butt....am watching it now (the aristocrates) and having problems focusing!!!. . It's all about a joke about a family who f*** each other....is it supposed to be funny because I just don't geddit?!?!?  Admittedly am not paying full attention, but all I'm hearing is incest, fisting, mother-son, father-daughter, beastiality and sh!te all over and blood.....sorry, but am I a stupid or prudish?????. . I guess it's the way you tell 'em!!. . Be happy;oD
not sure if you're having the same problem i am with the new Yahoo messenger,  but i have unchecked all of those boxes and it STILL auto logs me in every time.. . I think there is a problem with Yahoo - not the settings.  ;)When you open Yahoo Messenger and it signs you in, look up at the top and click on Messenger, then click Sign Out...that will take you to your sign in screen. Uncheck the "Sign in automatically" box. That will stop it from automatically signing you in when you open messenger.
Good question i did not know you could hope you canwell  just click messenger on your yahoo messenger interface..then  u can see a list then click yahoo chat! and then u click  join room..after that u can choose what ever chatroom u want to join..there are no chat rooms on yahooYou can't. IP addresses from certain countries (the UK is one) have been legally blocked from yahoo and MSN chat rooms, to avoid pedeaphiles taking advantage.
Don't open it for 3 months. It will be deleted automatically.you want to delete only ID and reatin the account by changing the name? like changing passwords? This you cant do. Whatever you do, the first name with which you opened the account will always be there somewhere.You cant delete any email id but it can expire if u dont login in 3 months.
i take it you have fully installed it....put in a contact or invite someone then you guys can chat...what icons are you clicking?...if its yahoo music and the like you may not have all of this stuff loaded on your computer...for instance i dont have a webcam so that icon is useless to me...to invite someone just click on contacts, invite, and enter and email address...once they get and accept the invitation they then download messenger and you are seti had a similar problem, if you have a program installed that changes the effects of youre desktop this can conflict with yahoo messenger. try disabling or uninstalling the program
Go to the bottom of ur window and right click the Ymess icon and choose to exit.when it signs u  in.. press Ctrl +D to sign out.. then u should have something telling u to enetr ur ID and password.. below them there is 3 check boxes.. the last check box says "sign in automatically ". UNCHECK that box :D.. that's allGo to MESSENGER on top box scroll down to PRIVACY OPTIONS click GENERAL then make your settings
Because you probably didnt give them exactly what they wanted so they gave you a low  star rating. That is all i can think of!sounds like you been a bad girl ,and had points taken away.only guessing.Maybe you got 4 points off, why? Cause Y! just tokk'em off!!!could be that yahoo or the asker deleted the question . so you loose some pointstell yahoo they owe you a few pointsMaybe you got 6 points for 6 thumbs up to a best answer.10 points best answer. -5 points for a question. +1 point for just showing up at Y!A. =   6 pointsAll your points cangenerate currently without your knowledge, (behind the scenes)  (asking a question minus 5 points)  and  your best answer (+10 pt) + thumbs up (however many that was) Combines together for a net value of the 6 pts. that shows on the board.. . /docSorry about that... you can have ALL my points... Happy Holidays!!!...That's odd. You should have gotten the 10 for the answer and 6 for the 6 thumbs up as well
You will need to upgrade to Mail Plus for $20 per year.  . No ads and you get a pop3 account to have your mail go to your Outlook box. And much more.. Eincoming.yahoo.att.com or net    outgoing.yahoo.att.com or net just that simple good luck
Your ratings block is grey to you but it is green to the other participants. Its grey because you can't rate your own answer.You just can't rate your own answers but everyone else canYou can't rate your answers; that's why they're greyed out. Other people's answers are greyed out for them as well because they can't rate them. But to other people, they won't be greyed out, and they will be able to be rated.
You will need to upload them to a site like Kodak Gallery or Clark Color to order prints. Or you can upload them to your Yahoo Photo Albums and order them from Target.save them to your My document folder, then upload them to snapfish an order the prints from there.
It won't go anywhere unless you check the proper boxes, you have options to check if you want it sent,  :)When you add a file, there is a checkbox for whether or not to notify the group that the file has been added.  Uncheck the box if you do not want the group to be notified about the file.
Anytime you visit a website (most times) data is mined from the cookies placed in your browser cache. From this data, information is compiled giving the asker such details as, what websites you visit, your geographical location, your IP, your email address. Also, filling out forms online will do this. And when you forward mail to someone and don't use the BCC line, all those email addresses are visible to those who want to use them for SPAM.This happens because when you forward your emails, your name appears on a list of email addresses through which that email has been sent. Anyone can take a random address from that list and start contacting you.You signed up for something. But that something was not anything at all. It was a spammer.Maybe someone gave them your email address to harrass you.Maybe it's spam..or someone might have used a random email address (yours) when signing up for things on the internetwhen you register with certain websites they can give away your E-mail address.
The points are just a way to encourage participation. There is no reward for getting points except for moving up levels. You lose points for every question that you ask and when you get a violation.You can trade your points in at Tesco's and Asda for vouchers !They go down when you ask a question, if you delete an answer, they go up when you answer, or when you select best answer, or if your answer is chosen as best.. Violations probably also knock your points down.If your points go down then you have had a violation and answer removed - you lose 12 points for each one.  Check your emails for violation notices .. The points are just for fun anyway xxxxYou get points as a reward for helping someone get their question answered as well as for the bragging rights.  . . Your points go down bc you posted a question like this vs. figuring it out on your own.Point go down for two reasons . . 1) You ask questions (-5). . 2) YOu received a violation notice (anything from -2 to -20). . And what do you get?. . Bragging rightsClick on yer points and level number.Well actually if you think for a minute, since it cost you 5 points to ask this question, if you are not running after points by any possible means, you will soon run out of it and then wont be able to ask questions anymore..Points encourage participation. You should loose points only for asking questions or receiving violations.
Sorry, but you go to options, then general preferences to change your display name on out-going mail!Get into your mail page - on the "mail" tab (the other tabs are: addresses, calendars, notebook) - you'll see an arrow.  Click on that and go to Options.  Click the link that says "mail addresses", Edit and then delete your last name.
I think you mean...e mail??You start by going back to HS and learn how to be good at being a smartazzEMALE? Is that when you send a man over the internet?first u learn english
on some things. if you hold the CTRL key down & scroll on your mouse up& down it will change the size.Hold down ctrl key and then scroll up or down. You could also go in i think, control panel or something and change the settings for font size there.
either the email no longer exists, or they have blocked you, it might also be listed under your spam.Either that email address is false or you have been blocked.Sounds like you might be blocked from it.  Depending on whos email it is.   they may have blocked you to stop you from sending emails to them.
i think you're right and the muzzies are wrong.The tattling trolls turn in all these different people, myself included, for bogus violations of the yahoo rules and yahoo never independently confirms that there was an actual violation so they just take your points away: 10 points taken for doing a violation, 2 points taken because you'd earned 2 points with the answer.. . No use trying to reason with yahoo. At best, you get an automated reply but they never give you your points back.. . Gee, then they wonder why some folks quit coming back...
Sometimes blue names mean they are on your friends list. That mostly happens when playing a game on yahoo. If it is a name you do not know then it is a person on your friends list using different name but under the original account name.Blue = Males.  Pink = Females.  Grey = unknown sex.. . Good Luck!
you know people these days........lookin for little kids to sneak up on.. . mabie it's because they don't want to get hurt over the internet since they can itentify you by looking at a picture they have. . I know a girl that has an avatar because she gets all the attention in school.they don't make them for fat people, either!  i want an old, fat avatar.
It takes 90 days before Yahoo officially deletes an account, so the Y! 360 will still be up. That's why it's best to empty all info from it before deleting the account.the same reason there are stray questions and answers from ...Ooops this person has been suspended people too.. I have clicked on people whos answers were off the wall and gotten the above so many times.  It's just a time thing I think.. I hope the alledged 'report happy trolls' don't come after me, I would hate to lose my account.  It may not be much but it's stuff I created so I want it to stay there and maybe be seen by a few people.
Not sure- mine is doing the same thing...not only that, but it doesn't let my friends in to see the pics when I send them permission through email. It's very annoying! Watch some weirdo is getting a hold of all of our pictures. Let me know if you figure out what the problem is...Thanks!?????????????
You will have to go to the yahoo mail to sign up. After signing up, you will have to download yahoo messenger to your computer. After downloading the messenger to your computer, start enjoying online conversations with your friends!!! :-)just get ID and then sign in 2 chat....
why would you inseam it?  Are you searching for a job in the sewing industry?yahoo has hot jobs posted too!!.  why not trythem?
people are pressing the thumbs down.change your answer settings back to -2 and the answers will be there with out this statement you've evidently changed it look a the box and you can see why the threshold thing is different than -2Other users have given those answers more than two thumbs up, and Yahoo! thinks that the rest of us don't want to read something that someone doesn't really rate. If you want to view all answers, just click the appropriate choice from the drop down menu above the answers.If your answer gets a -2 or more, it goes below the threshhold. You can change the presentation level, as the askerits this new thing they added. u can change it to view all answers, but u hafta manually do it every time. that thing is gay. i want to see all the answers and decide for MYSELF whether or not it is "below my threshold"- whatever the hell that means!! lol!Yeh, i don't understand that whole thresehold thing. I think it is useless, as if your going to click to open answers grrI have no idea what the "threshold" thing is, I wish somebody would tell me.
After you double click, press the arrow button down. You can hold the delete button if you have alot and they will all delete or you can delete one by one. i delete everytime my list gets to long, so I know this works. Hope it helps.Something to hide . . . do tell!!
ok click on the white boxes be4 the whole message when it you clicked on check messagesIf you delete it, you won't be able to get that ID back. You can click on My Account which is under your ID and make changes to your account.
answer more questions then askYou answer questions and you get 2 points if you get chosen for best answer you get 10 points. If you vote for the best answer to your own question you get 3 points and if you vote for a best answer for someone elses question you get 1 point, but everytime you ask a question you lose 5 points.Earn points by answering questions, choosing best answers to your questions and voting for best answers to unresolved questions.
I am assuming you mean "website". There are many free options out there such as yahoo's service, google's service, and i believe that microsoft also has a service for free. just go to their respective sites and look under their services. they are all easy to get started with, no programming experience needed.are you tryin to make one or view a one thats already been made email me if your trying to make one my email adress is tornadogamedesign@yahoo.com.
On Yahoo, when you're in your mailbox, there are tabs (with a beige background) with the following names:. . Delete   Reply    Forward    Spam    Move. . Making sure you're in the message of the person you want to block, click on Spam and follow the prompts from there.. . I never had to use it, hope it works!If you're using Yahoo! mail, don't open the unwanted message, instead click on the box and then send it to spam. This automatically puts the sender in your blocked sender's list. Do this for each unwanted message until you get rid of the ones you don't want to receive mail from.It's called spamming someone, honey.Without opening the e-mail, mark it as spam and you wont get any more.
i think it is becuase nobody really has those game boys anymore so they make them for more recent things so they dont waste their money on the olod school gamersYou need to buy a new hand-held system. That system is soooo old. They arent making ANY new anything games for that system.
I want an instant MASSAGE!. I have this spot on my back that's killing me!You would have to get a new account/profile to change your screen name.  You can't control what name they see other than that; they control it.
Why don't you just sign up for a new Yahoo! ID and use that one? You can sign up for more than one  https://edit.yahoo.com/config/eval_register .You can have as many IDs as you have email addresses.. :). EYou have to sign into your mail and go to account settings and you can change it from there.
What does this have to do with 360????. . If your ISP is not working, you should complain to THEM and not here, nobody can help you with that over hereAre you talking about your internet service? Your ISP?. I think that's something you would need to ask them!

You can't. If you leave it long enough then it will become 'inactive' but this can be re-activated. It is possible to reassign the account to someone else but this would need someone from BT (they use yahoo's tools) or Yahoo in canada to do this for you, which they won't!Just leave it never open in a while it takes several months to delete automatically!!if you want to delete your whole yahoo account including email etc..  just go to the addy below and follow the instructions.. . http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/edit/changing_users/edit-23.htmlYou can't delete it as such.

I dont understand it either. Geez, what CAN we ask anymore?. . I cant tell you why it was deleted. Its wrong though.wat did u ask exactly? is it good or bad or some one hate uu or somethingIf you asked something like "What is your favorite Christmas movie?" that would be considered chatting and a violation of the guidelines. Next time, put questions like that in the Polls & Surveys category.You asked it in Society and Culture. Questions about movies should be asked in the Entertainment and Music>Movies category. It doesn't matter that it is a Christmas movie. A movie is a movie and must be posted in Movies.Its a wonder questions still exist.thats very strangeAt least your reason wasn't in Italian or Portuguese (As many have goteen it in those languages).. . The system reacts without really looking into the validity of the claim

From no_life_louis. . That was bugging me too. I had like 485 attachments and there's no delete option. What you have to do is delete the actual email message which contains the attachment. Then it will be off the list. Worked for me. . Delete in inbox, sent, drafts, bulk & trash.If they were saved to a temp folder then you need to go to Start->Run and type %temp% and click enter. When the folder opens up go to Edit->Select All and then delete. . Otherwise all you need to do is find the folder you saved them to and select all and delete.

After you have posted your question, go to the right end of the action bar.  That's the bar that starts with thumbs up and down.  At the right end is a plus sign.  Click on it and then click on Add to watch list.  . . The watch list appears as a third tab next to the questions and answers tabs on the My Q&A page.   You can follow the progress of your questions and answers.  . . For me, one of the best parts of the watch list is that only you can remove items from the list.  If a question has been removed for whatever reason, it is taken out of the question and/or answers list.  It is not removed from the watch list.  You can't access the question itself since it's gone, but at least you will know that it did get deleted.go to q an ansClick the My Q&A link located underneath the Discover icon.. Scroll down the page until you see the My answers, my questions and my watchlist tab.. Click the My questions tab.. Click the link to view the desired question.Go to your Q&A page. there will be a tab for your questions. Highlight it and it will bring up that question. Click on the question and you can see all answersgo to My Q&A in the upper right corner. click on my questions.Just like this one - if someone answers your question for you, you will receive an e-mail telling you that you have received a new answer to your question.

It's more personal.I have done it because sometimes i like to see an answer direct from an ordinary person rather than a long boring preprogrammed answer.Cause these people prefer a person than a machine to respond.  They want to interact with other human beings.its getting to hard to sift through the ads & find the right site. I used to be able to get anything straight up, now I get frustrated with pop ups, ads, etc.itz al about the fun of sharing your knowledge and questions..in google u wud b just searching by yourself...but here peple answers u...u wait for peoples response and that makes us human feel gud..itz jsut a human nature...sharing like this is fun!..sumtymz..evn google wont b able to help u to find da xact ans u want...n da ans mite to too elaboate and complicated as well...where  as people here wil ans u straight forwardly and specificaly savin al the unecessary details!...and yeh evrybdy wantds to earn points..itz lyk a competition an also an funny addiction:DI wanna rip their faces off. Always some lyrics or pregnancy issues with the crazies up in here. grrfor you to answerI googled your question and the first result presented this answer:. . "I think there are different factors for different people and situations. Certainly laziness, ignorance of search engines, and wanting to hear a range of opinions occur sometimes. But another aspect is simply that it allows them to interact with others. Answerbag is a form of "social networking" website; talking to other people -- even virtually -- helps to reduce the sense of isolation we have sometimes. Its like asking "how are you doing" in a social setting; its not that the answer is all that crucial, its just the mechanics of social connection." [1]. . But I'm not at all giving you a hard time.  I wonder all the time about folks not just googling their question or checking Wikipedia.. . I think the main reason is laziness.  People don't want to have to plow through the search results to find the answer themselves, they'd rather wait around for someone else to do the work and get 10 YA points for it.  That's a shame, because the asker would learn a lot more if he or she did the research him- or herself.  They'd probably even come up with new questions, the answers to most of which could also be googled, or found on Wikipedia.  That's doubly a shame since lots of these easy questions are obviously from homework assignments.  These kids are trying to avoid work, not trying to learn.. . So laziness and just not knowing how to properly search for the data they want.  I'm sure that you've noticed that most questions here are poorly worded, ungrammatical, and contain spelling mistakes--all things which may indicate laziness, apathy towards the subject, and a possible failure to really know what they're looking for.. . So, you've asked a very good question.  I wish that Yahoo Answers had an option similar to the thumbs up/down that you could quickly click that amounted to "you could easily find this information with Yahoo search."They want you to help the google it... I mean, who knows what keywords to use anyway?there's many people can't use google or try to find what they looking for , if you are old in this ,  there's many people still newbies on here , so it's not a big deal if they ask, that's why Y!A standing for,This is the BEST question I've ever seen on Y!A.  I hope someone comes up with an extremely good answer to your excellent question.. . I'm with anabanana, though perhaps a bit less bloody.Because they want to...Perhaps they have, but seeing how many results they can get from a non-specific search can be horrifying. Sometimes the answer that they are looking for may not easily be found from searching Websites, therefore their best option is to ask a question where they can be as specific as they like.I've often wondered that myself, but I think many people have not  mastered this extremely simply skill.  They  may not know how to use Google.If everybody researched google and didn't ask questions on here what would we do with all our spare time and what could we feel indignant about?

Which brings up an interesting question:  who in their right mind would want to get rid of icons?  What is your motivation?  Normal people like icons whereas you want to lose icons.   I got to tell you, this whole idea is very strange.  Perhaps you should re-ask the question, and tell us a little about your question...you cannot get rid of icons but u can make it visible by right clicking on the desktop screen click show my desktop icon. it will visible any icon on desktoperase them ! ( right click - delete ) ( note if your desktop is locked drag will not work - do as i said ! )
it's telling you you haven't given the correct location for the file. i suggest that you take the file you want to send and send it to the desktop. look at the icon it creates and then compose your mail. once composed use attach file and look in desktop for the file (it'll show on the desktop folder with all your other desktop items)and attach it to the email. the same can be accomplisahed by taking the attachment go to start then run mspaint under edit paste, then under file save as file name and to desktop. attach it to you email. if a photo, save as jpeg or other photo type file, if letter save as normal text.I am having the same problem and have sent an email to yahoo, but so far have not got anything back from them.  For me this started after trying to switch to internet explorer 7, which didnt work, so I switched back to internet explorer 6 and this is what it has been doing since that.  Your not alone.  If they get me an answer or if I figure it out, I will post it.

Yeah, good idea.~~~I do like the part of giveing more points if the answer truley helped me out,,,I have had some awsome answers to my questions and would give some of my own points to a few of them,,,,no the system is fineyeahWe have already been given a lot of freedom. I would like to be able to control the amount of points you give to someone and i would like to give even two best answers in one question! Maybe a second best answer will always be good. Yahoo! did give us a lot of control over Yahoo! Answers, we report someone, and that person's question or answer content has been deleted, unfairly most of the time. That is a lot of freedom to me, but i would like to decide how many points i would like to give someone. I would also like to give points to the best question. Good question, i would like to give this one ten or more points.Nope.  Nobody cares about points except us.  I try to tell my friends about my points and they really don't give a flip.  I'd just as soon let Yahoo figure out what's best.. -MM

Keep in mind that this doesn't necessarily clear your history, especially if you are on a network computer.it depends on your computer..if its windows then there is a folder in my computer that says windows click on it and go to cookies..delete them all or go to find files and type in cookies and delete all of them they will disappear...In your IE browser page goto tools, internet options and click the clear history.  It will then ask you if you are sure say yes.

the only way to get rid of the 360 is by closing your yahoo account. if you choose to do this follow these steps.. . **Link to close out your yahoo account**. https://edit.yahoo.com/config/delete_user . . Note this will close out the entire yahoo account. Even your email.u can't rid off but u can close it. Remove all contents in ur 360 (pictures, blogs, reviews, quick messeges, all) & set ur 360 to private ... so other may view it as a blank page. goodluck ^_^My dear, you cannot, without deleting your whole yahoo account. It's a part of your whole thing once you've signed up for it.lol 260...the only way to delete your 360 is to delete your whole account...if you don't want to do that then go to your page and delete everything off of it...then go to your settings and set everything to private...plus deactivate your simple URL...Oh! is there a 260 yahoo page... . . I think U mean Yahoo! 360... right.... . There's no way I know of to cancel or delete your 360 page.... . U can always hide the blog, photos, etc. by going to the settings page and picking "Just Me (Private)" in the "Can be seen by" drop-down menus for each of the areas you want to hide...
The first answer is correct except that you are not looking to "change" it you want to remove it.  Yahoo does not require you to list your personal information to have an account so you can go into your account settings to access your profile and simply remove your name.  You could put something silly in there if for some reason it has a~~ *required ~~kind of a mark next to it, but I am pretty sure your allowed to just leave it blank.Go into your mailbox area, look at the top of the page it says MY ACCOUNT. Click there. then go change your info. save it.
i cant enter chat rooms with bt yahoo comunicator why?1.yahoo messenger(main window)-click on messenger-under messenger there are options-one of which is yahoo chat-then click on join a room.. then you will find a seperate windows-here you will find catagories(select whatever you like, then on right side you will find yahoo rooms(this is the place where you want to go-select any room and then click on go to room..

It happens sometimes when there is a bit of a glitch in the system or when they are upgrading something.  Just try the link again in a few seconds and usually it will work.  This site is under constant construction, upgrading and changing so it goes without saying that there have to be a few glitches from time to time.  They usually don't last long.Actually it is a beer break, but they figured the word coffee looks better!because there lay abouts and they were thirstyBecause they are full of S&%!Hey, I was thinking the same thing!

Nice latte or cappuccino.because the network is kindda slow
You can simply cease to log on to Answers, but all of your info now belongs to the community and to posterity - that is scary!!you could ask a lot of abusive questions and have your account deleted.then all your questions would dissapear.
Skin and features are better in Yahoo Beta mail, at least for me.. . Tab-browsing, and hotkeys can be used in Yahoo Beta mail as compared to the regular mail. For example, you can read more than one mail in a single window if you are using Internet Explorer. Hotkeys such as 'r' for reply and 'n' for compose can ease your effort of moving the mouse (thought I don't use them).It's more organized and more upgraded pretty much. It's cool.
In Yahoo if it"s been read the background will appear shaded in your inbox, white if it hasn't.Go to tools then option, in the window that opens click the receipts tab, then look down and click the box that will send you a read receipt when the other person opens and reads the e-mail you sent them.   I hope this helps?
there is a link on top of the page says "switch back to ..."Look under your ID. There will be a Switch Back link.

If you are trying to get into a room when you get that message, it is because you p'd someone off and you have been suspended from the chat room.. .

Send it in parts: The only way you can do that is if you have a scanner.

Zip the file using winzip . 2. Split the zipped file into smaller size (To split the file, open your zipped file in winzip then goto the menu Action>Split). 3. Attatch these smaller size files and send. 4. The recepient needs to save all these files in a directory and just unzip the file which have a .zip extension(all other files comes with a .z01,.z02,.z03,... extension) .He will get the entire file.

To switch from Beta back to original Yahoo! Mail:. . Either:. At the top left of your screen, directly under your Welcome <username> sign next to the Yahoo! Mail logo, there are three small blue links: “Log out” “Your Account” “Switch Back”. Click “Switch Back”.. . -or-. Log out or close the Beta Mail, reopen Beta Mail. .

It took me three tries to get it, myself (but then, I'm old and slow -- lol!).. . Good luck!use your system restore, if you don't have it reboot your pc and start tapping the f8 key this will take you to safe mode where you can roll back a day or too,calling your pc maker for tech support might be easier tell them you lost  or deleted a program and need a walk through on how to rollback. BEWARE OF ANYTHING THAT IS BETA !
It says "user over quota"  meaning the mail box is full and they need to buy more email space from their server.To me the key words are:. . User over quota.. . His mailbox is full, or for some other reason has too much mail.

Maybe because they have real life problems that are complicated and just want someone to care...I agree with you 100%. Sometimes I see those questions and it just gets me mad when they do that. Most of the times other people are trying to answer but they have to be explaining that they hadn't seen the first part of the question.why does this bother u so much??. . afraid they are getting attention that u would rather have??Haha that's pretty funny now that you mention it. I guess they are really are self-absorbed. Or maybe their question is so complicated that even they get confused and have to post in parts to keep in sync with themselves.

right on foono some ppl are computer illiterate, we have to make allowances for them.I understand the net.. Anyway, people use here because they have found no information in search engines or just plain cuckoo.I have wondered the same thing myself!It makes me think they don't know how to use the www or don't know about Google- a few years ago I did not have a clue- LOOL- now- now I do-some of us are better at using the net and info searches- DYou are old and grumpy!. I try my best but there are times I need help.. My Children help me at home (yes, the kids know more than I do).. Ignore the questions you do not want to answer and let the helpful people out there contribute to the awareness of the newcomers.. If you are too smart to answer the questions, ignore them.  Why should you worry?. Ignore us.. I have enough knowledge to go past the stupid questions I do not want to answer.I know what you mean.. . Sometimes though, people would just rather hear from other people instead of reading off a web page.I used a net the other day and caught some fresh shrimp. Just throw it so it expand out when it hit the water, let it sink to the bottom and just pull it in.. If, everyone looked up their question we would not be able to do this now would we. Then you and me would have never known each other. ;-)YesIf you're old and gumpy there are many of us with the same qualifications.......lol. I get annoyed by those too, made that very statement on another question like yours. But not much we can do about it, except ignore those!You are right! People should try to use search engines before they ask a question. Some people I think, feel it's much easier just to write a question and expect exact answer instead of trying themselves to find it out. In many cases people can find certain things they are looking for but they need someone’s opinion. Also, it is very hard to understand the question when people don't use proper punctuation at least. (e.g. you).In China, some websites are censored and modified and they are not free to visit any website in the Internet or otherwise, they will be arrested by China's communist party. The worst is that they will have a death penalty. So, stop being grumpy and discover that Yahoo! Answers is their only option to know what others think on the other side of the world. Besides answering silly obvious questions can earn you points and gain you levels! lol.You're old and grumpy (sorry, j/k). Most of us don't know how to use the net. This should not be surprising since it has barely had 10 years of widespread use.When i was growing up, computors took up an entire floor of a bldg. & only women typed! Please give us older people a break! Now 5yr. olds know about them than i do!

I hope I understand your question, but I think the answer is really easy.. . Do you know how when you want to sign out of Yahoo Mail, there is a link, "Sign Out", at the top of the page which you click. Also, right next to sign out is "my account".

They can't handle it.Baybee, I'm so frustrated hearing of others and myself getting violations, yet others stay on the board. I emphasize and symphize with ya.They probably do, you just only see the ones that haven't been deleted yet... becuase they haven't been deleted yet.From what I hear, it's not just you.
If you have internet access on your mobile you just need to go to yahoo page...sign in as u ustually do..and that's it! you're ready to check ur mail!If is different for all providers. I suggest you contact the cell phone cmpony or go to their websiteu should get a razr and get an aim
70 thumbs down ... and you come back for more?. . Talk about someone who "can't take a hint."I got one for you. Are you an idiot? You must be to ask stupid questions like that.If you don't know why, that's just another of your problems.The reason it got so many bad hits is that it was tasteless and you should have not asked it in the first place... . . Next time you would like a punch in the face just ask. .  "please punch me in the face" . . Then you will get good hits......You ask too many stupid stuff.Because it was very insulting.Your question was very insulting and offensive.U really r a douche bag & this confirm it even more.You're wasting all of our time with this nonsense.. . Please pick this as best answer so I can be rewarded for your wasting my time.Only the Yahoo Gods really know.Yes, your question was ignorant and stupid!!Well what did you expect...  You insulted 15% of the population of the United states!  I'm surprised you only got 70.. . It must suck being both fat AND ugly...  I'm certain that these people know it already.  Why use such a cheap shot to ameliorate yourself.  Are you THAT insecure?. . Live and let live babe...  take it easy, mean with a purpose to check the neck of or correct someone that is being stupid is one thing.  Mean, just for the sake of being mean, is quite another story all together.  When you say such things to people with those kinds of unfortunate circumstances, you just make yourself look ignorant and dare on a hoard of insolence from the bleeding hearts of most onlookers.. . (Most people however only feign concern and kindness to make themselves look better and silently agree with you but that is beside the point.)  In a social world, you can either be against the social standard of behavior and blend in or you can be an upstart and a trouble maker with an unpopular opinion you wear like a badge...  Your choice!  . . I suppose that makes you the minority.  a minority that you are probably happy to be, but it is rude,  none the less.  . . "Any experiment of interest that will be carried out in life,  will always be made at your own expense."  Sir John Wilmot. . Oh well, maybe you finally got it across to all the fat and ugly that you are just not interested in them?  But at what price...  now, no one likes you!  (Except me... but I have a soft spot for trouble makers.)  . . and I am certain... that all of the people calling you names in turn for having an unpopular opinion and the balls to voice it, don't realize at all how they are no better than you are for calling you names...  no matter if its true or not they have no more right than you do and yet they feel they have the right because you stuck out your sore thumb and screamed for people not to bump into it.  Which is exactly what people do...every time!  . . So basically...  Every single person who called you an "idiot" or "ignorant"  are no better than you by a simple comment you called out at least 70 people.  . . No one likes that either love.   Boy oh boy...  you dun screwed up!70 is quite impressive. . . I guess there are a lot of ugly and fat women using YAhoo Answers.
If you are an adult, use Metacrawler as your search engine (just type that word into your Yahoo! or Google search box).  When you type in an "adult" word, it will give you a choice of viewing filtered or unfiltered websites.  Choose unfiltered.  Make sure you have popup windows blocked as well as excellent virus protection on your computer.I was going say the same aas the one above.. Try going through your parents windows account...you're blocked somehowIt is difficult to give you the answer to this question obviously the person who set your system didn't want you to view adult content.how old are you?
The point of this forum is to ask questions and to receive answers.... . Abusive is what is not allowed... opinions are.  Like them or not!. . Expect it in an open forum... not everyone is going to be nice and tell you what you want or need to hear.  . . It is called life...  . . All you have control over in reality, is if you are going to decide to let it bother you or not.  You have no control over what kinds of people you are going to get when you put yourself out there like this... Nor should you expect it.. . I think the problem that should be addressed considering, is why you care so much?I would like if peoople kept answering my question. It shows how intrested they are in your question. I don't know how this whole thing works here but can't you resolve the question? I dunno.Not pointing this at you by any means, but some people ask for it when they ask certain types of questions.  An answer you do not like is the chance you take whenever you ask a question.Report them or give a thumbs down rating.people are people some just don't any better and some people think that because they know something that every one knows it. and others just need to put there two cents worth in weather they know what the are talking about or not.
we should get points for asking questions because without questions there would be no answers.The site is called "Answers".  We get points for sharing information. It just makes sense that we have to loose them for asking questions, to me anyway.  Remember you can easily regain points by answering questions, choosing best answers to resolve your questions and voting for best answers to unresolved questions.
Check under tools and toolbars. See if you have it, if you do check it.If you goto to www.adobe.com and download the 'Shockwave' player, from the download section. Install the player and during the installation process you will be given the option to install the Yahoo tool bar.
simply delete the name frm your messenger list.jus' hit the DEL button man!Its that simple!u just need to remove the id from your list but before doing that u open a window fo IM to the same person. once u have removed the id from your list of contacts, u will ave the option of blocking the id from the IM box. once u have blocked any id, that person cannot message u again unless they create a new id. but then u would know how to block them then.just take them off of your messenger list or if it is harrassment contackt whatever messenger you use im sure they can block the person permanentlyHold on...let me think...uhh...either block his/her address the next time he/she im's you, report him/her for harassment, or erase his/her data altogether.You delete the person from your Contact list by opening a message window for that person and then in the main Messenger click on Contacts>>Delete. After you have done this the next time you receive an IM , click on Action>>Contact options>>IgnoreSome messenger services have an "IGNORE THIS PERSON" facility. u can use this , or u can delete this person from ur list of contacts on ur messenger.First deleat that person's id from your messenger list. Then just wait till that person messages you again. This time when the message box appears it will have an ignore user option, somewhere on the top right hand side, ther will be a circle with a diagonal slash (similar to a no entery sign) in red. click on that and you will be warned that if you click yes then you wont be able to recieve or send messages to this id. click yes and say "good riddence!"jUST CONTACT THE SERVICE PROVIDER AND ASK THEM TO BLOCK THAT PERSON....:-), U cant Stop Him 4m Messaging U but U Can Ignore Tht User,Or Do One Thing U Also Start Bugging Him,He'll Get Fed Up Of U n Stop Messaging U !!sign on invisible.  it wont stop the person but it might slow it down.
sure you can delete messages, I don't know from where you are wanting to delete them, or if you are talking about your yahoo email messages, you just click on the email in question and click delete. When there is an error on a page you can delete it too, just click on big X on top right hand corner.. . If you are talking about yahoo im messages or offline messages, for IM messages you go to archives, and select the people whose messages or IMs you do not want to keep. for offline messages, the messages left for you while you weren't on line or didn't have your yahoo messenger on, you can erad them, respond to them and then delete that message from the offlines, and go to next message, you can hit reply key and answer and then close the converstion box and then press delete. If I didn't answer you rquestion, I am afraid you need to provide a bit more detail, like what messages? from where? IMs, emails, offlines?. . Sometimes for the stupid error boxes they keep popping up, and won't go away, so in that case just shut off your computer manually, after trying to shut pc from start menu, if it doesn't work just press the start button on your tower, and keep holding it until pc shuts off.do you mean messages in your email, you are not very clear on this question. try rephrasing
Sign out, close your browser, reopen  it, and sign in again.  If it's still screwed up, try clearing your temporary internet files.They did an update a couple of days ago. Are you having sluggishness with it as well?It must be your computer, mine looks normal.Mine seems to be working fine, everything looks exactly the same.. Maybe its something on your side. Sorry.Try restarting your computor...see if that helps. My yahoo is working fine.mine is working finesorry to hear your having issues I havent had any as of yet I dont know what you would have to doCheck your monitor settings, maybe it is your computercheck ur settings

this one one made personhi me, this one made it!I didnt know they werent. This one came thru.I looked at your profile (see link below). Prior to asking this question, you asked three questions. As of now, only one question has received any answers. I think you should go back and add some details to your questions, especially the one regarding a Christmas present to your girlfiriend.This one made it.
The fix.. 1). Log into Yahoo! Messenger.. 2). Click on Messenger.. 3). Click on My Contact Details.. ~If you want to have your First Name only, delete your Last name.. ~If you want to use the Nickname field, delete your First and Last name and enter the name you would like to see in the IM box in the Nickname field.. ~If you want only your Account ID to show, leave all fields blank.. 4). Always click Apply and OK when making any changes.. . The reason...... you probably signed up for a Yahoo! Messenger Account using your First/Last name.  They will show in the IM window when you send an IM or receive an IM from another user, unless you change it.    . . That does not mean the other person you are chatting with can see your First/Last name. Your Contact Details must be sent to them. If you have not sent your Contact Details to the other person you are IMing with, they will see your Yahoo! Account Name (or Nickname) and not your First/Last Name. . . If you have previously sent your Contact Details to the other person, they will need to delete you from their list and re-add you in order for you name to change on their list.. . For addition explanation and information go to http://www.chatauthority.com/changename. http://www.chatauthority.com/editcontactinfoClick on Messenger in the menu bar and then on My Contact Details. Put your ID in the nickname box and save.
If you're blocked, then don't go in.  It's blocked because the site solicits minors for sex, does not really follow its own listed rules, and just generally SUCKS.. . Keep off.  My son is 16 and has his own home computer.  I have restricted his access so that myspace will not load.  He hates it, but he'll deal.  So will you.If you do then there is always the possibility of the computer people have a watch on those sites and they can take away your computer rights in the district. :)  I work for a school and that is one of the things that I do.

When I attempt to open the beta email version I get a window "Yahoo! mail beta experienced a login error: login error: object expected". I have been able to contact Yahoo by telephone on two occasions since the problem arose yesterday. I am told that the issue is  systems problem that Yahoo is attempting to fix. . . As matters stand, you cannot even revert to the prior email because you cannot get to an email window that allows such a change.. . Shainh_2000the way you can fix your display is either improve your picture quality on your computer screen. You can do that by just going to windows' website so see if u can download any updated installments
click on tools then internet options then content and click auto complete.if you are using IE7 than click on toos->Internet option -> . . in general tab select Delete in Browser Historys options.
Yoy know it pains me a lot. Why do that?Other users have given those answers more than two thumbs up, and Yahoo! thinks that the rest of us don't want to read something that someone doesn't really rate. If you want to view all answers, just click the appropriate choice from the drop down menu above the answers.I hate that. Even when I tell it to show all it goes back to the -2 ratings.  Ugh.. Yahoo needs to change that.  Its so annoying.Any answer that receive a -2 rating is not revealed, unless you change the parameters of itUnderneath the question is written" answers",to the left of this is your option or show button,change this to" all answers".. . Thats all there is to it.You know I wondered that>that you have your show rated above selection turned on and other people have given that answer enough bad ratings to make it not show.
try another email provider with your bank!. I've had problems with. yahoo before!. check your Filters,Spam, maybe Blocking itno, a new computer should have nothing to do with it.

"SWITCH BACK" BETA MAIL has been f@cking up everyone's e-mail   (with log in error )  "LOOK AT THE TOP of the BETA PAGE" next to (my account AND (sign out ) IS SWITCH BACK , click it and forget it. "BEST ANSWER"Terrible question. What does "It" mean ... Yahoo or FireFox?. How would we know what "original" means to you. How do we know what version you were using?I'm running firefox and Yahoo beta and have had no problems at all, are you on the latest release of Firefox?. . If you want to go back to the original Yahoo mail just look at the top of the screen when you log on (if you can) and under where it says "Welcome xxxxxx" it should say "switch back"  just give it a clickThere is a know problem if you have yahoo messagner installed on your computer with firefox due to a plug in. The fix for this can be found on the firefox bug website.I use firefox and beta and haven't had any probs.Good question, I thought this was just me.. We're waiting...???
I'm with NTLworld and their spam filter is pretty good - I've tried switching it off and I get tons of spam so I leave it on and this email you're talking about is the only one that gets through.. . You could try contacting your ISP and telling them about the email/spam you're getting and they might add it to their blacklist in their spam filter.. although I'm to tight to pay a premium rate call to do this.. and as my email program (thunderbird) marks these emails as spam and files them as such I don't worry about itI get about 20 a day ....please let me know if you find a way to stop them...also i just dont see any point to them.?If It Is Being Sent Directly To Bulk Mail By Yahoo, It Means They Already Suspect It Is Spam. You Need It In The Mail Box That Has The This Is Spam Option At The Top And To Mark All Such Mailings As Spam. This Helps Spam Guard Filter Out Unwanted Mail And Maybe Spot Future Ones Before They Reach You. You May Want To Check Out The Resource Center Listed At The Bottom Of The Mail Page For More Information On Combating Spam. . I Hope This Is Some Help. Have A Gooday.I keep getting those. what a complete pain in the ar$e.. Even when i report them as spam they keep coming.... . dont know how to get rid of them sorryThose are getting thru everyone's spam filters right now.  I'm sure there will be a fix soon, but for right now there doesn't seem to be a good answer.
Click on your avatar. Click on edit my info under your avatar and change your user name.Click on your picture and then click edit my info and its the first option.
you should click on the blue line below the name of attachments, for eg: if your photo name is 'dsc001' and it is displayed in the list of attachments then you need to click on the blue line below the name that will prompt you to download the pic. sometimes, the pictures are displayed in the message and are not shown in attachements, in that case, right click on the picture and save it to the target folder (eg: my pictures) thats as simple as that.well u can switch over to the new internet explorer ...you can gets update your page.
from what? Email address that you no longer want you can cancel it or not logg in for a long time and eventually it will get canceled. If it is through messanger, you can just press delet when you highlight the name.go to my profiles, beside the screen name  click the delete button and click yes when it asks if you are sure, you can't remove primary one though
you have to change your settings for it to be public! you have a choice to make things on your page public or not it is up to you!Go by Yahoo 360 on your page and click the settings and you see, there is places you need to click "public" and save... and everybody can visit your site.... have fun.im not sure but i have mine on public and i cant get if off public. i have changed the settings and every thing and no its public forever.

If u need any help with this matter i can help u further and talk u threw the steps to get it public.activate your simple url in your settings. it will not show up in a search but if you go directly to the url it will take you to your page.
Have you tried clicking to view the invite that you sent? Is there a delete button or link in THERE?they are supposed to die off after 14 days. You might have to email yahoo help on this one.
You must have lost connection while the chat applet was loading. The first user id usually disappears after awhile.You can't fool me, you're trying to get on "adult" chat, aren't ya?the pedophiles  closed them. they would get on chat to talk to kids, so yahoo thought it would be a good idea to keep everyone off of it.
why do u all feel sux ?. i find it ok n load faster den the pervious normal one leh!. i feel it betta lo.. . its a trial only?u'r connection might be slow.just click on the mail and the message will appear below. though it is slow and really clutteredfor real, it sux...  it's hella slow.. just switch back :)I hate that thing I swiched back over. Never could get it to work right. Sorry for leaving you an opinion insead of a answer.
I dont know where exactly your going wrong but Yahoo messenger help has the trouble shooting steps for that in the other communications. or use this addressDownload Skype?Make sure it is plugged in. Next, it  is imperative that you speak OUT LOUD. A microphone that can transmit your thoughts hasn't been invented yet. It will be available soon, though.First make sure they have a mic or ear phones if not it won't work.If you are typing to them look up on top of page & click on the phone,you will hear it ring & hopefully they will hear it on there end.It will pop up on there screen accept call,they click on that & that should do it.
I've just tried it and it worksMy experience has been that they NEVER answer email questions sent to them, even tho they send a form letter response saying they will answer your question in 48 hours.  However, I have 2 phone numbers that do work, I have received courteous, excellent help , and others have told me the same.  1-866-492-4664 or 1-866-562-7219.  Good LuckIt seems like you're frustrated. If you give us some more information, maybe we can redirect you to a place that can be more helpful. Remember that Yahoo is a very large company and it's also a weekend. Tell us more information and we might be able to help.
I dont know...if it's been deleted check in the trash...if it's still in your inbox do this: there is a search button at the top..enter who is was from or subject. it should bring it back up.  For instance you list Tom...when you search anything that has the word Tom will come up.
use "forward"Use the FORWARD feature.  In other words, open the email, then click on FORWARD.  On the next screen, either type in the other email addresses, or click on the option to add them from your address book.Use the foward feature provided in most of the emailing services. Fast and easy, and don't forget to alter (if any) specific nouns for recipients and changed it to the universal form
You need to download Yahoo Messenger.  There is a text message feature on it. I use it all the time - so much more convenient!thats wat i would like to know
I don't know! It's strange... you could contact yahoo for this (even if they don't answer mails, you can leave a comment on their yahoo360 blog!).If the site you're blogging at doesn't list all their blog to search engines you'll probably never show up. Then again. If they do, bear in mind that you have to wait for some time before the search criteria are updated to include your page as well.
have you got your fravrits list up if yes take it downhave you tried to set the page ? zoom should be by 100% and text size by large . Check on your tool bar for the page button !Or ctrl and scroll up or downCheck your quick comment.. someone must add a long text on it... Or there is a URL link on your other text box...on the home page there is a "page options" link on the top right side.  click it and choose the narrow option.  also if your favorites are on the desk top you may have to narrow them or even close them.  it that still doesn't work go into windows control panel under display and choose a higher resolution for your monitor.It's either your text size or zoom level. Click View > Text Size > set to Medium. Medium is normal. If text size is set on medium, hold down the Ctrl key on your keyboard and turn your mouse wheel to change the zoom level.
Go to the top of internet explorer.  Click "Tools" then "Internet options"    Click the tab for "Content."  Then click "Autocomplete."  Then click "Clear Forms.."   Then "Ok"  And "Ok"  again.LoL so i guess u dont want ppl catching u raiding dirty.  Well its quiet simple u just got to go to tools then internet options then hit delet but this is if u have the new version for the internet explorer.
Welcome to the club. I have lost most of my email this very same way. So I changed it to another server on another company. But this is time consuming.My stepson is in afganistan Several times ive seen this

(To the far left) Depending on the speed of your computer it should open up in a couple of seconds.

You could also find a list of previous versions of Yahoo! Messenger on the right panel.Just type yahoo messenger into your web browser.. . EGo to www.yahoo.com and look for the messenger. Download and install it.
I wanted this feature too..Sometimes your question might fit in more than one category & when you dont find enough response in one, you may want to move it to another. As of now the only option is post the same question again in the new category.Cuz Yahoo puts it in a category for you.

Yahoo! Messenger stores your last 5 custom status entries so you can simply create as many as required to bump it off your list or you can download and use Andy's Clear/Edit Messenger status history utility. . . Andy created the Clear/Edit Messenger status history utility because your status messages are stored in your registry and unless you have extensive experience and time on your hands it's not recommended that you delve into that area to remove your current entries. His utility will will let your remove / edit your previous Yahoo Messenger status messages or you can either clear all or just select which ones to remove, you can also edit existing ones (for like if you do a typo etc) or create new ones. you can download it from our repository page.... http://www.wackyb.co.nz/option,com_remository/Itemid,3894/func,fileinfo/id,5/ . or check out his forum thread.... http://www.wackyb.co.nz/vb/showthread.php?t=353As you add new ones, the older ones will be deleted [automatically]. There's no other delete option.
If you have a regular email address (outlook express, etc) you can just hit "Insert, picture" instead of "attachment" but you cant do that in yahoo mail.Some email programs (yahoo not being one of them) allows you to just insert a photo.

By their e-mail address.you can start by going out more and communicating with people?!?!?Do you want to over Yahoo?. Do you know thier Yahoo ID?. Go to your profile page and at the bottom you will see something like searching for friends. Type in their ID and you can go from there.I use zabasearch.com its free and usually finds them.
(m). . A reference to imaginary small type in a policy contract supposedly containing exclusions, reductions, exemptions, and limitations of coverage. Most state laws include specifications for the minimum type size that can be used in a policy, and they also provide that exclusions cannot be printed in type smaller than that used to print the benefitsSmall print (also known as fine print in the United States) refers to the practice of including necessary legal terms, warnings, disclaimers or other phrases in small writing on commercial or contractual documents. Small print is usually included at the end or bottom of a document, in a smaller type size (as well as generally being in capital letters to make reading more difficult).Fine print is pretty much everything either written in small print at the bottom of all contracts or what you have to 'read between the line' and get a more rounded understanding of what you're reading before signing. A lot of contracts word things in such a way that they can be takin to mean more than one thing.
The time between the list of quesiton page to load to the time you clicked on the actual link gave ppl time to respond in between.Yahoo's database is a little slow to update - they are probably using their own DB or some derivative of MYSQL.i think it depends on how fast you type and how long your answer isCuz yahoo is behind. Sometimes it takes a few minutes to kick in...Also if youll refresh your page, thatll change.. . Awesome avatar!
Click on your name thingy and then click on "edit my info" and it will bring you to your "nickname" and you can change it to anything you want your nickname to be.

And then you will be able to change it.
I really hope Yahoo will correct this problem soon.. Because if they don't I will switch to MSN Hotmail.. On Live.Hotmail (the new version equivalent to Yahoo mail beta). you may choose the coding of your email from inside the web platform. It's much easier than on Yahoo mail.This is a beta.. Hopefully someone on the Staff will notice and solve the problem.. In the meantime, there's always the switch back link in the corner.
Click on this link. Go all the way to the bottom where it says CONTACT US. Push the button.If you find this out, please post it EVERYWHERE.  It seems to be a well guarded secret. . . UPDATE 11/10/06. I had used the "CONTACT US" button on the bottom of the page and got a reply back from Yahoo's "Customer Service" --which was mail@cc.yahoo-inc.com.  But, the answer I got was exactly the same as what is in their "help" section, which was of no help at all.  In it, it stated :. . "We received your feedback form and we think the steps outlined below will resolve the 'Failed Delivery' problem. But if we missed the mark, don't worry. Simply reply to this email with a detailed description of your issue, and a living, breathing Customer Care Representative will get back to you ASAP. "  . . So I replied and got a response that was exactly like the first (except it did not include the paragraph I just quoted).  Obviously, Yahoo does not really have a Customer Service department, just a whole series of automation that spits out the same crud over and over again.http://help.yahoo.com/help/us/mail/...... If that site dosne't help try >>. 866-562-7219 Yahoo! Customer CareDon't worry if you can not get on the system...it happens regularly!
go to tools, then interent options there you can make yahoo your home page.Open the 'Control Panel' in the Start menu. If it is in 'Category View' (2 columns of 5 categories on a blue background) click on 'Network and Internet Connections' and click on 'Internet Options'. If Control Panel is in 'Classic View', click on Internet Options. Once in Internet Options, there should be a category for 'homepage'. Delete your current homepage and type in www.yahoo.com and that should do it.Just close your eyes and think about it so hard...Open Internet Explorer to the page yu want as your home page.. Click on Tools &#92; Internet Options &#92; Use Current &#92; OK &#92; File &#92; Exit.. Open your Internet Explorer again - there you be!  Enjoy!yeah
No - If deleted from 'all photos' they are permanently gone from all albums.. . Also don't rely on Yahoo for long term storage, keep a copy on your PC and/or a CD.its okay
Hi,. You just need to go on Internet Explorer, from the menu bar you can select Tools=>Internet Options=>Content tab. Over there you will see on the right side the button Auto Complete if you press that one and click on "Clear forms" all your previous search will be gone... But to avoid future problems in the same page of "Clear Forms" you can untick all otions in "Auto complete for" this will avoid any further problems.someone dont want their wife of g/f to see?
Easy. Just bring the drop down menu up by clicking on arrow to right of pop-up blocker icon and check pop ups blocked. It will ask you to reset to zero press ok and your done.Tools, pop-up blockers, uncheck turn off or on... whichever applies to you.go to www.google.com. download their free version of Ad Muncher, another player told me about it today!  It's great, no more ads! No more lagging in the Canasta Room's.. . Stopzilla is also good for blocking stuff, but it cost for their product, although well worth the price.  I use 3 blockers and 3 adware scaning programs, still can't keep up.  But with Ad Muncher, it's great, at least will be, when I let it know what programs to let thru.  lol
you right click on the picture then click copy go to message right click and click paste.save a picture on your computer and put it in a file. remember the name of it. when composing an email, go to attachment, browse for your file name with the picture and click on it.
there were probaley many users here easily offended by anything religious i guess. and this one was like a sore thumb that stuck out..-IMHO.Wasnt yahoo, its the democrats who report it for no reason.maybe yahoo realized the question was a lie and deleted it.
Just click on the attachment link. If the sender has sent it correctly then there would be no problem at all.right click on the attachment,scoll to and click"save target as.."
somewhere in the address section there is a box labeled block sender. just click on it and thier name will be blocked and they wont be able to send you any more mailforward all their emails straigh into recyle bin, or junk emailReport them as spam, forward them to a different folder, or change your email address.
You can either create an Avatar, or you can upload a cartoon photo that you have saved on your computer.  Upload it to your account, and then save.. . To get it to display in Yahoo Answers, go in and change your settings, telling it to allow your Yahoo ID photo to be used.. . Hope this helps.Go to Yahoo! Avatars and create an avatar for yourself..download a picture from your camera or somewhere else and  save . and hit browser and upload. good posting.
It maybe possible that your system has a firewall, or your router is not allowing for this. Make sure you allow ports for this file transfer.. Also make sure you have the correct ver of the messenger you want to match your Op Sys. (i.e.) Windows Xp or Mac OS X. Check your isp for connection issues, if your dial up, you may get disconnected while in transfer. Maybe it's time to upgrade to a different isp.. At times the servers supporting this file you need, could be bogged down with allot of ppl downloading files. you could get a response like: "server busy please try again later". . Lets not forget the messenger site: http://messenger.yahoo.com/let your pc rest then download again..Father...I am assuming that you want messenger with voice?..Yahoo's new one..It is good...check your change/delete section with all your installed programs...scroll down to Yahoo and see if it's there first...Hit repair, if it allows that option for this program...If not, start to delete it...They will probably prompt you and you can repair/ complete the installation from there.... . Otherwise, go to the Yahoo site again and start over...Their server will communicate with your pc and do it for you...All the best... :)...Yukoneze
Follow directions on pkg.to hook up to your computer.Then get on MSN you will see a picture of a phone recieve,. 1st click on person you want to talk to,then click on phone.Have your volume up& click on the phone,you will hear it ringing.Please, visit the below mentioned links to know about the similar troubleshooting questions & there exhaustive excellent answers about the Yahoo Messenger,by the YAHOO-itself.Site is about, help your-self and solve your problems,you may check related links for tutorials..I hope that will do.. . <http://help.yahoo.com/I/us/yahoo/messenger/contactus/contactus-01.html>
maybe they are taking it as a racial question. give more deatail as to why you are asking the question.be a little more specific.Probley because it offends people.  Just a guess thow
Many people are too shy, or paranoid, to want to do that. Me, I don't want the people where I work to see where I REALLY spend all my time!! ;~)i don't even know how to have one of those cartoon pics on :(. . . EDIT: I found iteveryone is not like you. . anyway i can't see ur pic wellI like my little baseball player avatar dude.  If you're that curious to know what I look like, check my 360 account.  :)1 evry dont have it. 2 evry 1 are not as gud lookin as u. 3 evry dont have 360. 4 many dont botherb/c i have more things to do than take pics of myself and put them on all these goofy sites.. besides, i look just like my avatar.Cause I like to remain anonymousMy nickname says it all.  If I could figure out a way to put up my rank insignia or my functional badge I would...I actually don't use anything because this is my hubby's yahoo account. If I put a picture up it will show up on his Yahoo mail account too.I don't know howi would like to , i just have,nt found how to do it yet.  watch this space loldo u consider that a problem???to you tell you the truth i am to lazy to up load one
same way you clear all your searches (and this will clear all searches ie: yahoo and google too.). . From IE, go to tools------> internet options-------> privacy---------->clear forms.. . If you're using the new IE: tools------->internet options------->delete browsing history------>delete forms.If you searched for something you should not have searched for, clearing your history on the explorer may do that.  There may be a limitation on how many searches are held; doing 50 other searches may bump it out.Stop looking at porn and dirty videos and you won't have to worry about it
Yes you are right. It sometimes makes me crazy with its slowness...Loading problems with the beta seem to have something to do with Internet Explorer.It does not work too well with older versions.Try  downloading a Firefox browser and you may revise your complaint.Firefox seems to be a lot faster at loading the beta,which seems to fit better on Firefox than I.E. which can be a bit clunky at times. You can download a free Firefox browser at Mozilla.It works for me.may be there is a long way to goProbably because it's an "Unknown zone (Mixed)"
check all folders, junk mail etc. some mail will go straight to a folder rather than your inbox.If your email is on MSN I have experienced the same, (though not as many emails) It usuially corrects itself in time, but you can sometimes resolve it by deleting temporary files by clicking internet options, on the tools list and clicking delete files.. It won't do any harm to try this anyway.Are you running MS Outlook. It sound as if you may using something like Yahoo. Outlook tends to run in the background and download CC's of your e-mail.you are not on your own, i have no idea where they go to, its so spooky, are they ghostly invisible messages from the other side of life??????   lolmaybe they're in your spam folder.Have you checked your spam or bulk mail folders?
after signing in to yahoo, click on messenger and click on go to yahoo chat.Messenger>>Yahoo Chat>>Join a room. . Some IM rooms are hard to get into. Must be a bug on the newest messenger. But most rooms are fast to get into.Open your messenger, click MESSENGER in the menu, click YAHOO! CHAT, click JOIN A ROOM, click on the category and the sub-category you want to enter. Then click GO TO ROOM, click ENTER CHAT. Once the chat windwo opens, you can either type the message in the box at the bottom or click someone's name to chat with him.
Doesn't that almost discourage you from asking questions? But sometimes you just gotta ask.Because they don't want too many questions over loading the system and they are trying to get us all gaming for points.. . They teased us in the beginning by telling us we'd get cool things for our points, but really, all you get is to answer more questions per day or ask more, if you want.Hi Tiff, honey that is just the way they have it set up.... so answer more questions than ask them to get ahead on the points,,, and climb the ladder to success like so many of us have..... lol.... . .  good luckCheck this out. http://answers.yahoo.com/info/scoring_system;_ylt=AtEMXiP9h9.jrPX9UMkRQcQezKIXBecause you get 2 points for every answer and asking a question costs 5 points.It encourages people to answer questions more often than ask I think.That the rules sweetheart. Read them.That is the scoring system and the idea is to get people to answer question but not ask them. Strange in a sense other then not wanting people to flood the thing with dumb questions. Maybe it would be better to just limit the number of questions you can ask and not take away points for asking htem. In any case this is their system and it seems to be working at the moment.-5 for asking a question.  +2 for answering a question.  -10 if some a s s h a t reports you and you get your question removed.  Or -10 if you answer a question that gets removed.  Beats me.....that's exactly how the points work...didn't you read that when you signed up on Yahoo Answers?Everyone loses points for asking questions, and gains points for answering. To gain information, we need to loose points, but to provide information we gain points.you get +3 for choosing a best answer after 4 hours . . .
Rub it out.Masturbate, but use a condum.  You want it to be safe sex.Beat it.drive it off a cliff. Oh, unless you aren't talking about the car, well you could always think of some ugly nasty looking person that you would never have sex with in a million years.
Either (a) your questions deserved it or (b) somebody is being a jerk and following you around and reporting all of your questions.. . Do the Yahoo emails of notification give any reason why?because they are stupid, this is just wuestions, it is not like Janet Jackson is flashing her boob or anythingyou are probably going to keep loosing points every time you visit or answer or ask a question. just wait for now like 24 hours and everything should be fine.Because they are A-holes! They do it to me and I don't even say anything bad. Try rewording it, I've done that and it goes thru anyway!
click on the blank square with the smiley face. then go to edit info and click on the yahoo 360 thing.If you want a pic/photo, you need to go to http://360.yahoo.com and sign up for an account.

Yes I have had the same problem, if it is done through an email through yahoo answers, then you can only use the link in that person's profile to send them another email. . . Otherwise, for the questions you have answered or the question you have asked on the yahoo answers page, there is a green box to the right at the top saying "my Q & A" so go there to view your answers to peoples questions and their questionsyou can also go into your profile and view the questions you answered, I forget if our answers to the yahho questions are kept somewhere. . . But you seem to want to email the other person, so that is ok, just click on the link from her yahoo answer name and it will go to her/him, or just go to that persons profile and click on their link to send new email.You can't .  You can go to answers and find their account and see if they have an email address or messenger that they allow you to contact them on.

If you're only 12 you're not supposed to be in chat rooms! If you're 18+ you need to ingore those type people.I'm 16, and someone asked me for my cell phone number and my home address!Hun, chatlines are pretty much MADE FOR pervs. BE CAREFUL!!
Sorry, I don't know how. I would say right click over the bar and exit! Also... you might wanna check your settings!Try right clicking on it and then delete, if no luck go to control panel , go into add & remove ( be careful to not delete something you might need) and see if there is a file there for a tool bar that is not familar to you and read properties on it and maybe delete there, as in remove... Please read all info first, no whiz at this, just an idea   Good Luck
make a new email address....?Go to any useable PC connect to the internet. Sign in. Go get Mail
right click on the folder, then it should say delete.right click on the folder you want to delete then select delete.First, remove all of the emails that are in the folder. Above the Folders, there will be a [Add Edit] link. Click on Edit and beside the folder there will be a Delete.
isn't that considered spam?Have you tried clicking the report as abuse hyperlink?yep they`re totally annoying and i`ve not seen their answers get removed either. wot really gets me though is some people i know show a sense of humour and they get their questions and answers removed and they get violations. they`ve even had questions and answers removed for no real reason. i feel p*ssed off for them because it ruins everyones dayYou have to report them yourself.I'm sure these folks get suspended regularly.. . Don't let it bother you, and it won't bother you.arrghhh I know! they're so annoying!. . one of them is called 'c g'. . and the other one has a girls name I think, starting with a D...can't remember but they are pissing me offthe reason why he hasnt been kicked off as there is loads of these people on the yahoo answersYes it is,loads have reported him, say f*ck and there's hell to play!Yes it isThey do get booted off but sign up again with a different email address xxxYeah but they uaually make more than one account so yahoo cant keep up with them... theres loads of themThey use different log in names (though they use the same nickname - so it looks like the same bloke).. . Check out their profile, they always have only a few points and they've only been users for a short while.Yes, it is against the rules, under the heading "spamming/advertising".  All you can do is report abuse, but it doesn't seem to deter them.. . If you visit the American site, there are always non-questions that are just links to fundamentalist Christian websites.  . . It would be nice if, after say 25 reports of abuse, these twerps were banned from the site.sign up and you wont be asking so many crap questions about loveI've noticed that-and it never really bothered me. That is,until I got a violation for spamming because I replied to a question asking which internet service we used! I didn't provide a link-just answered the question! And it set me thinking,why did I get a violation notice for that when those with the dating sites in their sigs get away with it??? I wouldn't report them-I'm not that petty! But it does seem rahter unfair to me!
I don't remember now - but you have to tell it like 5 times you don't want it when installing messenger - which give me one more reason to Not to install it.. . I can't find it it my preferences as some are recommending,  but that maybe because I didn't install it.. . I would uninstall Yahoo Messenger (very safe - all of your "buddy" info is stored on the Yahoo site). Then install it and make sure everything is unchecked except for the Yahoo Messenger program itself.. . Otherwise, check for preference on the Insider screen to Not start it - when starting Yahoo Messenger.U can never turn it off.......Big Brother is watching you!!!!!click on the messenger tab at the top, find preferences, uncheck the yahoo insider tab.When pull up yahoo messenger........see Messenger on the left hand side.(top).......click there and look for preferences......click on preferences and then go thru each category (on left side)setting up each as you wish.. . Thank goodness they give us a choice huh?
actually, its not a team that puts people's questions into categories. the system looks for key words in the main question, then places it in a category that those keywords are commonly found in. i suppose some people dont realise its up to them to find a suitable category to put their question in, and they just post it wherever it ends upI always thought that people were just too dumb to put their questions in the proper categories.
Go to tools and then internet options.  You should be either able to go to the default setting or type in the address of the one you want.I went to "http://dial.sbc.yahoo.com/" or if you have DSL I'd try. "http://dsl.sbc.yahoo.com/". AT&T, Yahoo &SBC have joined. Give it a few seconds it should transfer you to your page, or download the toolbar, if none of this works go to "http://www.yahoo.com" and then to "My Yahoo" or as a last resort, make a new page.
Because bobbing for melons is bad for the teeth.Hypothermia rocks....apples are somehow creepy.  but it is weird.By A.D. 43, Romans had conquered the majority of Celtic territory. In the course of the four hundred years that they ruled the Celtic lands, two festivals of Roman origin were combined with the traditional Celtic celebration of Samhain.. . The first was Feralia, a day in late October when the Romans traditionally commemorated the passing of the dead. The second was a day to honor Pomona, the Roman goddess of fruit and trees. The symbol of Pomona is the apple and the incorporation of this celebration into Samhain probably explains the tradition of "bobbing" for apples that is practiced today on Halloween.History. The custom originated among the Celts as part of their celebrations of the Samhain season, celebrations that grew into modern-day Halloween. The original custom generally took place during large gatherings of people. Apples were associated with love or fertility goddesses; the first person to catch an apple would be the next one to marry -- a tradition that echoes in the modern "throwing of the bouquet" at weddings.
Sorry buddy,, u can't get that message again, u could have done one thing that u can accept that request that time when u get that  message on ur cellphone, just forget bout it now, u can ask ur friend to add u again, or instead u can send him/her the add friend request. Nothin to bang ur head for it..they will notify you once....and thats it...
you probably havent installed ot... just do what it says on the YIM thing on the main menu.Could it be that you were using web based chat not Yahoo Messenger. Yahoo discontinued chat via browser effective Nov 1st this year and remove supporting it protocol. Since only way to chat is with Messenger, however considering number of problems newest version presents, opting for older (6.o – 7.5) version is recommended in my opinion:. . http://chat-clients.com/content/view/422do you still have it installed in your computer you may have to reinstall or get a newer version . . you could make a new screen name and password if you have forgton your other one and cant sign in with thembecause you have to install it on your computer that's why
Sorry for the confusion. As mentioned by a couple of users above, the leaderboard wasn't updated properly this week, and we're investigating now to make sure whatever caused this to happen is fixed.level 4 is not that great. I know it sounds like an accomplishment- sorry to burst your bubble. You're going to have to give up your day job to be anywhere near the top of the leaderboard. Not a wise move though.... that's if you give up your day job!Unlikely.. . The leader board works out positions as at midnight on Sunday night, Monday morning, so you have to remember how many points you had then.. . OTOH it might be that two week retrograde thing.  I diodn't know about thatThe boards have retrograded to about two weeks ago, so that it the reason for you failure to find yourselfI can't find mine either!!. Just found my position 677!. with 30,030 points..level 4. I'm now 5,730..level 5. dukalink6 was right..give him the 10 points!could be try yahoo helpI think most people on the leader boards are Level 6 or higher.no im not there either,im level 5You have to constantly and continuously check each page.  It's is frustrating. I've been on Y!A since 6/06 and still have not found myself.  I just don't have the patience.  I concur with blacklablover, I think it's certain levels.. . /docThe leaderboards haven't been updated this week.  You may actually be on the leaderboard with less points than you have (from a few weeks back).It is probably that it just hasn't posted yet. I have never looked for mine and don't know if it would even be worth the effort. . . Wait a week or so and then look again.o.....kay

This has worked for me every time I have done it you should try!!!on your inbox, go to options, search till you find it. there's all this stuff about everything. just click on everything. also, on the left side, there is a little box, those are cool too. go there. you can change like the color of your e-mail screen. it's cool, just go
It's impossible to erase that much e-mail at once.Hold a large magnet against your hard drive.i would say, get a new account...Page by page is the maximum that you can. You must be a member of some fan club to get that many.Open your (wherever you have them stored) file, point and highlight the first one, then hold your shift key down and hit the arrow down key repeatedly to highlight them in groups - not all -  and hit delete! That's it!. NDS
If you have the new version of messenger, you can't uninstall it from Add/Remove programs.. . You will need to go into your Program Files, click on the Yahoo! folder and uninstall it from there.go to "MY COMPUTER". choose "ADD OR REMOVE PROGRAMS". a list of programs will pop up. find yahoo messenger. and click the "UNINSTALL" buttonGo to "start", then to "my computer", then to "add/remove programs".  Scroll down once there and find yahoo.  You can delete it from there.  Also, if you look in Accessories, find yahoo and it may have an uninstall feature.Whenever I do it, which is more often than not I got to "my computer" click control panel on the left hand side about half-way down and one of the options that comes up is add/uninstall programs. Scroll down to Yahoo whatever and click it, it highlights and gives you a cancel/uninstall question. And just go from there.
just click ignore. or delete the person's email adress first from your account and put his/her address in the ignore list.i don't know...how?  wait...why do i care?

First you need to log into your Yahoo email account and use your mouse to select that boring profile image.  Once you do that you get an array of choices.

I think they subtracted everyone points instead of adding for last week. Voting on open questions have been messed up for DAYS!!like everything else on yahoo its crap n not working i can't even get points for voting.The thing is out of wack. I noticed it also when I went to check on my points this morning.Actually, in the leaderboard, my points are lower than last week!. Not only they have not been updated, they went backwards another week!. It is showing my points of 2 weeks ago.It only count points up to 10 PM PST; after that, it's all 'this week' points
I see a lot of people asking this same question this morning...but my system is fine and not having a problem with Yahoo mail or anything else...call Yahoo techs or see if one of the Yahoo help people from Yahoo Answers can assist you. ;)Do You Still Have Your Account?I also can't get into my yahoo mail.  (Along with many other users.). They must be having problems today.
have u tried an antivirus??. or reinstalling yahoo messenger...but deleting yahoo folder as well?. if u this doesn`t work priv me on mess..id wisky_roolzHere you have some good and free antivirus programs:. http://askcomputerexpert.ws43.com/download/. Get one!
Yes, if they are chosen best answer. The number of thumbs up will be added to the ten points they get anyway.They get a point per thumb if their answer is chosen as best.Yes it will.  If i give the person above me a thumbs up ( and which i did) she will get the number of thumbs up minus the number of thumbs down.nope - it's just a ratingI always give an interesting, amusing or unique question a thumbs up.. It is simply a way of showing appreciation for someone else's intelligence.. Ditto thumbs down for lack of the latter.No points for thumbing up a question. It just shows that other people think a question was good.

wrong emai address...Probably the connection never went through.  Are you certain you have the correct email addresses?IDK...that is starting to happen to me all the time. I am about to contact Yahoo! Email advisors and ask them why. At first, I thought it was something with my computer, but now I know it isn't.
you need to wait 4 hours before you can choose..then click on best answer...click on me for best answer on this question!!!Go to My Q&A (which is top right, highlighted in green). Click on that, then click on your Questions and you will see (after 4 hours or more) that there is an option to choose the best answer.U choose me!!!!All of your questions that aren't resolved has gone into voting so all you can do is vote for the Best Answer.Just choose the one with my nickname on it. (Plss)you got to wait for a day, I think, then select 'best answer'. easy. good luck
Serious questions deserve serious answers. Some questions are really not questions at all (Just look in the politics section), and a funny or witty comment may be justified. If it's funny, or if it's witty, not mean. Also, some questions get asked over and over. It's hard sometimes to avoid being a goof when seeing the same question for the upteenth billion time.because people think they are sooo smart!! it is annoying!
Scroll over and delete.  Retype.click on the e-mail and  press  delete or you can do go to the delete on the top of your e-mail.. I hope that helps
I agree with you.  The guidelines are simple and the people who get questions removed are asking questions that violate those guidelines.  I've had two answers removed, and both times it was a justified violation.  I knew it when I wrote the answers, but I wanted the asker to know how I felt.whats dumb to some people isn't dumb to others. don't worry I'm sure your time is comingI asked a legitimate question ( does anyone know what movie screenplays sell for in Mexico and South America?) and it was deleted. Is that a dumb question? If so, why? 10% of the country is Hispanic and there is a reasonable chance someone may have an answer.  There is no reason my question should have been deleted.I think its just depends on whos online, cuz some great questions get deleted immediately sometimes. . . Youve been lucky, if you havent had any deleted. Hope this isnt your first.
Does it matter?. . The question is out there, now - people have probably answered it. Why not just pick a best answer after awhile?Once it's on it's on I'm afraid. The only way you can tell the world that you have changed your mind is to 'add details'. . .                   THIS QUESTION HAS BEEN DELETED!!!!. Although you will find that some dipstick ( probably more than one) will answer it.. If however you have had no answers you can 'Remove this Question' as an option.Go to your Q&A page and click on "My Questions" and click on the question you want to delete. Under the question are edit icons, the end one is a pencil with a drop down window. In there is "delete question".
360° is a free site so it can't be reomved from your computer. All you can do is go through and make everything Private so that others can't see your info. Or delete all of your info on the page.You can't delete a 360,follow directions below to make it private>Select the "Settings" option at the upper right of your 360 page and change all of you settings to 'Private'. This hides the majority of your content, if someone stumbles onto your page.. . Perform option #1 and then select the first "Display Me As" option on the Settings page. Now your profile doesn't link to your 360 page. Also, UNcheck the "Activate Simple URL" setting. This way people cannot guess your 360 page by sticking your yahoo id onto the end of 360.yahoo.com. . Perform options #1 and #2 and then delete your friends by selecting the "My Friends" link in the upper right of your 360 page. Select "Edit Settings" on a friend's name, then select "Remove <friend> from your Friends Page". Finally, delete all of your content, blogs, links to pictures, lists, reviews, etc. This pretty much makes your 360 inaccessible and/or unusable by anyone who happens to get thereGo to the page  and delete it.
Once you have chosen your answer to the Secret Question it cannot be changed.. . Good Luck!I'm not sure. I think it's a secret.

The only thing I can think of is that someone is also in your e-mail.  Everytime you log in, it bumps them out and then they log back in and it goes back and fourth.  I used to do that to my ex boyfriend.  I found out his passcode and I was in it one day and he logged in.  I got bumped out.  He ended up catching on and changed his password.  But men are simple minded and I figured it out again.   But anyways...try changing your password and see if it keeps happening.  If it does, sorry I can't help you out.. Good luck!Same thing has been happening to me, so I think its a yahoo bug, that we need the yahoo techies to answer to. Unfortunately. they don't give much of a way to direct these questions to them

he was talking to your friend and copied the message over and pasted it, he was clearly talking to your friend crazy stuff like that doesn't just happen.  I have used Yahoo messenger before and have never seen anything happen like that without someone copying it.probably just a mixup with your messenger service... kind of like when you can hear somone else's cellphone call on your phone.  I wouldn't worry about it.
if you mean getting your yahoo email into your outlook express then:. open your outlook express>tools>accounts>add>type your yahoo email and password>use it as a default. good luck.i think it's in the options where you can change settings and redirect e-mailsAs far as I know you have to have MailPlus to automatically forward / redirect your Yahoo Mail to an external email address.. . This costs about £11 (UK) - about double that for the States. You get various other benefits too. I've just done it myself - check out the link.. . http://help.yahoo.com/l/uk/yahoo/mail/yahoomail/mailplus/

well there a lot of jelous people in here, the guy who reported him probably has mulitple id's and reported him under each of his id's, thats enough for yahoo to suspend his account. if i were u just  ask him to make up another id and carry on as usual.this is the best advice i can give u.I personally don't report people like that; I just like to mess with them.  Unless it is something very serious, I don't think snitching is necessary.  I'm sure your boyfriend can create another account; don't worry.Poor guy. Maybe he's posting inappropriate stuff you don't know about? There's no other logical reason.. How about he just make a new ID?just set up a new account,Check his old profile and answers. people dont get suspended for nothing...so perhaps he's a jerk?apparently he did enough to warrent getting suspended. Y!A should have been sending him emails about his violations so that could give him a little insight about what he did wrong.
Go to your Q&A page and click on the My Questions tab. You can click on the question to see the answers that you have gotten.Open up your Question and below it are your Answers.go to my Q&A at the upper right corner under discovery.
You`ve got something I do not have. Mine is the same as it was.Have you re-booted your computer or do you leave it on all the time?  If you haven't re-booted - reboot it now and see if it doesn't go away.  Comptuer's have so many weird glitches it's enough to drive someone crazy.
If you have your messages archived in your messenger, then any offlines from contacts on your list will be saved there.. . Check messenger (upper left on messenger) >> preferences >> archives.  If you hadn't previously fixed the settings, you can adjust them to delete if 10 days old, or keep and delete them yourself rather than automatically deleting them when you close your offline window.Click on Recycle bin Icon on your desktop, then click on the message you need, hope this helps.
the messenger will not connect. I have installed IE 7Problem sign in where exactly do you mean, please elaborate.problem sign in--means wrong user id or password or  wrong case is used in password. sometimes  server problems also  may give  sign in problemsYeah U may type the address of the E-mail I-d or a wrong password or a mistake in the ID or a password with the change in the letter U may use the caps either in the email id or the Password in password U may be given the letters only in the small letters. .

You need more points.  This will increase your level.. . Don't forget that you get points back when you select a best answer, and you can also vote on undecided questions to earn points too.answer more questions,... see when you ask a question it takes away 5 points, and when you answer you get 2 I believe.  So you are losing more then you are gaining.You just need to have points to spend! Keep answering questions to gain these!you have to earn points and once you get to a certain level you can ask as many as you like,,,,xxxYou should choose the question that you really dont know the answer or that you cant find in web search or wikipidi...etc2 points. Sorry just using you to get to level 2 so i can ask more Questions. Remember to choose best answers. and don't be as obviose as me. answer my Questions and I will pay you back 10 fold. . A friendanswer more questions to get more points to ask more questions you with me????u have to move up in levelsAnswer more questions and try to win "best answer" since that gets you 10 points. The more points you accumulate, the higher category that  you will be in. You lose points for every question you ask but, the higher your category, the more questions you get to ask and answer each day.. . You also get 1 point for logging in each day... and can get points for voting as to "best answer" on questions in voting.
I would like to know too!!  I can't delete pics to my profiles, or photos account, nor can i add a new pic to profile now.  I'm very frustratedI don't know, but I have the exact same question.  I know how to delete a picture, but yahoo does not give you the option to delete, so how do you take away a picture you no longer want in yahoo pictures.
E A S Y !!  Just go into the email that you want to delete.. go in meaning put in your password, etc as if you are checking in to your particular email account.. THEN when you are in.. go to MY ACCOUNT.. usually in the upper left someplace on your screen.. go to delete my account and delete itIf Yahoo! is your provider:. (1) Go to email. (2) check each box you want to delete. If you want to delete all of it, check the box at the top of "sender" and hit delete OR hit "check all" at the bottom of the list. Everything will automatically be checked. Hit "delete", and you're done.- select the email you want to delete (to select multiple emails at same time hold CRTL key and select more). .  - click on "Delete" button on the screen OR press "Delete" button on your key board.
You should only give out your Yahoo address.. There are some e-mail accounts that have a default that will send mail using your other e-mail account name. View the options on your account to see if you can set it.Because it is an Internet mail program you really can't make it you primary mail program like you can with the hard drive mail programs.  BUT you can do this:   When you are on your Yahoo mail sign in page... click TOOLS, then OPTIONS, then GENERAL. then click on Make current page your HOME PAGE.
You must "cease and desist", at once!Options: . . 1) Do not use Yahoo! Mail for 2 months and it will automatically delete itself.. . 2) Click on "My Account" at the top of the page and choose "Edit/Create Public Profiles" and then choose to delete your current profile. You can only delete your current profile if you have another username. Example: You created another profile and you don't want your old one so you delete it.. . I hope that this information helps!Yahoo! members can remove their own accounts and account information from Yahoo!. Please follow the instructions below to initiate the deletion of your account.. . By terminating your account, you will lose access to your Yahoo! ID, Yahoo! Mail, and profile names. We will also delete your account data and settings across the Yahoo! network. This includes any contents in:. . * Yahoo! Mail. * Yahoo! Address Book. * Yahoo! HotJobs. * GeoCities. * Yahoo! Briefcase. * My Yahoo!. * Yahoo! Groups. * Finance Portfolio. * Any other area of Yahoo! that can only be accessed with your Yahoo! ID and password. . Please be sure you want to delete your entire account as you will not be able to reactivate it after the account has been deleted. You are always welcome to sign up again for a new account.. . Terminating your Yahoo! account does not alter or delete your Yahoo! People Search listing, which you need to edit or delete yourself. . . You could close your account @ http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/edit/changing_users/edit-23.html&#92;.Go to.. My Acount.. at top of this page.  (blue letters). E
Save the pictures to your "MY PICTURES" then attach it like a file in the jpeg formationWhile your composing the email, click on insert photo.It will take you to what pics you want if  you have yahoo photos go from there, or go to your pics.. . Hope this helps..Good luckJust click on the 'attachment' button in your email program, and browse until you find the picture you want to include (you need to know where it is on your computer.)  After it is attached, it will show up in the mail automatically, in most cases.
Log into Yahoo! Messenger, click Messenger, My Account Info. Sign in if requested or log into any page and click on My Account at the top of the page below your Yahoo! ID and sign in.. Click on Change Password.Under your ID, click on My Account. Verify password and you will see where it says Change Password.
try signing in and when they ask for password.... click where it says 'forgot password?'. they will e-mail you to an alternate account or ask a 'secret question' that you answered when you 1st got the accountYou just wanna be emailed, that's what.
You let them build. You gain more and more and reach higher levels and with the higher levels, you get more privleges. There is no money to be made, no prizes, just self satisfaction. Something to pass the time, you might be able to help someone with a question.Points encourage you to ask and answer more questions.I just let them accumulate.
sounds like it could be spyware.  try to change the settings in your control panel. if it keeps reverting back or won't let you change it, it probably is a virus or spyware...ok to change homepage you need to go to the control pannel and internet options thats were to change your homepage as for changing the text when on an internet page if you goto view and text size change it to suit you this acts as a default and should stay the same!
hit "clear"There should be an icon that looks kinda like a pencil..it is located to the left of the search bar. Click on it and there is a link that says "Clear Search History" Click that and it clears those searches.Pencil. Drop down menu = Clear Resent Searches > Click on it. All done.
Try holding down the Control key as you press Enter or Send. This should over-ride the blocking.Try not typing like a tard.

It can't be gotten rid of. All you can do is remove anything that you have on the page.You don`t. You`ll loose your ID So remove what you don`t want. Also make it so it isn`t public.
Its probably jsut showing the name that is on your account. To have it show your ID, click on Messenger in the menu bar and then click on My Contact Details. Put your ID in the nickname box or first name box and save it.The fix.. 1). Log into Yahoo! Messenger.. 2). Click on Messenger.. 3). Click on My Contact Details.. ~If you want to have your First Name only, delete your Last name.. ~If you want to use the Nickname field, delete your First and Last name and enter the name you would like to see in the IM box in the Nickname field.. ~If you want only your Account ID to show, leave all fields blank.. 4). Always click Apply and OK when making any changes.. . The reason...... you probably signed up for a Yahoo! Messenger Account using your First/Last name.  They will show in the IM window when you send an IM or receive an IM from another user, unless you change it.    . . That does not mean the other person you are chatting with can see your First/Last name. Your Contact Details must be sent to them. If you have not sent your Contact Details to the other person you are IMing with, they will see your Yahoo! Account Name (or Nickname) and not your First/Last Name. . . If you have previously sent your Contact Details to the other person, they will need to delete you from their list and re-add you in order for you name to change on their list.. . For addition explanation and information go to http://www.chatauthority.com/changename. http://www.chatauthority.com/editcontactinfo
You may want to check how many invites you have that have not been answered (they will be listed in your "Favorites" category.. . Try deleting some of those and see if it solves your problemIts possable your at your limit for pending messages try deleting some of you old messgaes and then go ito your sent folder and clear out the old ones then try again...just like E-mail you have a limited amout of storage space.i think yahoo doest want you to have lots of friends or there might be limit for making friends, delete some unimportant people and than try again.. . good luck in finding friends
No I don't agree.  There are other 'pay for advice' sites.  If Y!A starts charging, a lot of people living on fixed income will not use the site any more.Yahoo! is a free web service. If you want to pay, there are other sites around that do so. If we have to pay I'm not using the site.agree. there are, however, sites like that.. for example, there are medical sites where you punch in your credit card # and for like $50 an expert answers your question.OK, how much would you charge for this one?  Maybe you have a GREAT idea here for a new website with serious questions, professional answers...and Pay Pal as a business partner...Yeah but we're all cheap aren't we. Most of our questions can be easily answered with the help of either an encyclopedia, a psychologist, or just the internet. I wouldn't want to pay. Besides, even if we could, you'd get few answers if not any. It's good that people with all kinds of knowledge can log in--i know there can be a significant number of exceptions with this. But I think we're better off free.. . Besides...even if you do pay, what does that guaruntee you? Yahoo! doesn't control the answers, so someone could pay just to say something wrong. Too much of a waste.Most of us are here to help each other, learn something new and maybe have a few laughs to relieve the tedium as we go along. I gladly give advice for free and appreciate getting it for free. I'm just sick and tired of the tattling trolls that ding you for alleged violations of the rules and then nobody at yahoo bothers to independently verify if the accusations are true or not. They just take your 10 points because some whiny baby complained.
If it's yellow, it means that they are signed into Messenger. If it's not lit up, they aren't signed into Messenger.the smilies tell you that that contact has a yahoo account,,  the yellow ones are one line at that moment.. the blank ones are off line.
You just have to wait for the yamsters garbage man to come get them. usually it takes a few days or a week to do that.. They will go away eventuallyNope, they stay on the list, just grayed out. No one can see them but you.you cant delete your questions or answers once they are resolved, they go into the main database for everyone to see. . . if your questions are not resolved or in voting,  just go to the pencil and click delete. if you have answers that you want removed just click delete next to them.No. I think they're just there to remind you that you once asked them.
To put it simply; it's like an online journal but you can allow people to read it.A blog is a place where you can keep log entries, about whatever you want.here's some links. www.blogger.com, www.livejournal.com, www.xanaga.com etc www.myspace.comblog is short for "web log" which is just a place online that you can put down ideas, thoughts, share information.  People can then access these blogs and see what you have to say.. . Usually they have the opportunity to leave comments so that you can even get some dialogue going.

I don't know,but,welcome to Yahoo!Answers,bud,this Is the Best Website for Questions,and Answers.E-Mail me If you wanna talk about something,anything,I'm here 4 you,bye...Go to Yahoo,my account. Preferences and Settings and that will probably take care of it... But if you get group e-mails directed from Yahoo you should look the bottom of one of the e-mails and it will tell you how to unsubscribe from the group.like taking pee out of a pool.. once you give any of your information to a company they NEVER remove it, . in fact, you have a better chance of that information getting stolen than you do of getting the company to delete it.My suggestion to u is to go to contact us and let them know u want to close the account...then on your computer go to control panel the add and remove and reove it from ur computer.
I don't think there is away.You don't, if that person doesn't want you to. All controlled by the user of that email account /profile.

The whole e mail has to go from the sent folder to save space. They are listed in drive c or documents one at a time.If I understand your question correctly, you want to delete some pictures from your PC, right?. . You need to go your pictures, highlight the pics you want to delete, RIGHT click, then click the word "delete".  They'll go to your recycle bin, if you change your mind you can always undo the delete.  If you don't want them in your recycle bin either, empty it.  You empty it by double clicking your recycle bin icon (found on your desktop) then click file, then click "empty recycle bin".have you tried hitting del actually? That being in your sent items.

It's possible someone is changing your password and accessing your account.  Change your personal/security settings and see if that helps.Does it give you a reason for a new password?

don't think you can.You can delete your answers to questions, but you also loose the points for those answers. It's best to keep the answers!

You will also loose five points for deleting a question.. . If questions have been resolved, your questions and answers can't be deleted.you can't .. they become property of YahooAnswers and remain until they delete them (if ever).You can only delete those questions and answers of your's which are in the open category.

There is no option for adding background music like on My Space.. You can add a link to a song in your blast (find and MP3 on line and copy the shortcut into the link section of the blast) - then someone has to click the link to play the song.. . If you use the share music link you have to set up a Lauchcast account and then it will provide a link on your page to your Lauchcast station that others can play.There's a sidebar on the lefthand side that tells you to 'share music' - try that.

Right click on the icon and go to open in new windowIf you are talking about having a yahoo page open and wanting to leave it open and open another, just minimize the existing page and click on the internet and open another one. You have just about as many pages open at a time as you want.Or you can go to the File menu and open a new window. Either way gives you a new window without changing the previous one.The new IE 7 makes it alot easier by opening a new tab

View the Avatar in another app. Then take a screenshot with Alt-PrintScreen.. Open MS-Paint and save the picture as myavatar.jpg. Then add it to your profile as your picture.Whats wrong with the head?You don't like the head?Look,all you get is a head.Think about it,who would want a picture of your knees.Be happy with the head.The head is fine.The head is good.. Give some people a head and before long they want the whole body!I swear,Can't we just be happy with the head?You should be thankful you get a head.Maybe if you didn't have a head,then you should ask for more than a head.i really cant answer that question, wish i knewzoom out buddy.. : )You can't as far as I know -- Y!A no longer allows oversized avatars. You could take a screenshot of your whole avatar, shrink it down to the right size, post it to your 360 site and select it for your new avatar, but I think that is the best you can do. Sorry!
If it was reported as a violation, you should have received an email stating what the violation was. Otherwise, it might have been removed because one of the answers was reported as being a violation, in which case that person received the notice, but the answer & question were both removed. Sorry!what was your question, did it breach the community guidelines?
THE ONLY REASON IS GREED,. THEY DO IT BECAUSE THEY CAN.. DONnever give out your credit card numberYES YOU SHOULD HAVE BEEN ASKED FOR YOUR CREDIT CARD..........You were creating an account for a minor?......... Yahoo asks you to give your credit card number if you are a minor making a new account..they do this for the security of the minor.........its like yahoo saying."Go get mummy or daddy to see what you are doing"......... the actual input of the card numbers tells yahoo yes an adult/guardian does know what is going on......... Yahoo say they charge ($1 i think).....but no charge ever goes through.........its  a SECURITY MECHANISM set in place  so kids cant make accounts without their parents knowing...You cannot make a juvenile account on Yahoo without giving this CC info.  Yes there is stored value............your input of CC numbers were NOT correct or your card was  invalid..........normally wen signing up a FREE account dey do not ask for any credi card information. . . if its der they usualy mention it as optional..You shouldn't...sounds like a scam.  Start over from Yahoo's home page and try again.You should not have been asked for your credit card info, be careful.

you don't. shall we all go look it up nowOnce the best answer is chosen, you can‘t change anything.. It is in Yahoo‘s data base and no longer subject to any change.you promble went to my qa  thanbdelton your your qustionSorry it is part of the data base now. So it stays.You don't need to delete it it just stops appearing as "open" IE: no one else can answer but you don't have to do anything after you have picked a best answer. Hope this helps.Was it because you put your addy in a question?? Try speaking to the yahoo team, they may be able to do something for you, I'm not promising though.
A lot of people get on yahoo at the same time pretty much. Also I would reboot my computer because that is what I did and it helped a lot because yours might be kinda old and then it just needs a boost. Lastly, you can delete some things on your computer and then it will go faster because then it does not have as much to load in case you want to open it. Hope that helped!A lot of people are having problems. I re-booted and it helped.Because they aren`t able to buy and to configure a proper server for their claims. Oh, sorry, my mistake , the answer is like this: they have claims but they don`t have reasons and staff to have them.I think its your internet connection.. I've experience the same thing long ago, when I had slower internet, but since I've changed the internet, yahoo mail'z been working great

If you want a shortcut to your desktop go into "start" then "all programs."  Look for yahoo messenger and then right click on it.  Go down to "send to" then click on "desktop." . . If you don't have yahoo messenger then there should be a section on yahoo's page where you can download it.  Hope this helps.Hey, im a little confused as to what ur asking. Do u mean u have downloaded yahoo messenger and want it on ur desktop or u want to download it and have it on ur desktop? . Sorry im having a really dumb day today lol.You could download it from official Yahoo page:. http://messenger.yahoo.com/ . However considering than newest versions are buggy and have lots of problem opting for older version (6.0 – 7.5) is in my opinion recommended:. http://chat-clients.com/content/view/422. After installing Messenger icon will be added to desktop automatically.
I know what you mean!!! This has been happening to me recently too!What is your question? If i know  the answer,(or think I do) I will answer you.

The Leaderboard is updated once a week, Sundays after 10 pm.. . HOWEVER, this week, they put up a chart that is two week old, so who know what will happendunno you're doing better than me! Keep trying never give up!I don't think you reach the leaderboard until you're a Level 4.  Are you sure you saw people with less points than 950?  Maybe you saw their Best Answers, or their questions asked?  I never bother looking so I don't know whether you might have been mistaken or not.Have you got enough points to get on it? Alternatively, maybe someone has got more points than you, & has knocked you off.Because you're wasting your precious points on asking silly questions like this!. . By the way, the leaderboard is organised per level. The first umpteen pages will be packed only with "leaders" on level 7 and 6. Not to mention the other hundred pages filled with leaders from level 5, 4, and 3. You're only level 2. I'm sure you must be on the leaderboard, but you should be somewhere on page 2039 or something and I bet you can't be bothered to look that far. I'm some 850 points short of level 4 and even I don't bother looking for myself on the leaderboard.why does it even matter.because leader board is only updated once a weekmabye you dont have enough points. who cares!!The leaderboard is out of date, therefore you may not have had enough points when that leaderboard was originally updated. Keep looking on a Monday (When it should be updated), and remember to subtract the number of points that you've earnt for the week so far.
you have to be a level 2 or higherUnderneath each answer , to the bottom right you will find a gray box with a thumbs up a thumbs down and a flag. Click on the thumbs up sign .Of course you may not be able to do it right now as you are yet on level 1.When you want to give an answer a thumbs up, all you have to do is click on the thumbs up.. Glad that i could help..  Plus, you have to be in Level 2 to vote on questions. Maybe that's the problemGo to it and hit the thumbs up  ^^^^^sweet! i just reached level 2 and gave my first thumbs up!You have to be at level 2.what level R U? level one can not rate.. . /docAt level 1, you can't rate answers. When you hit level 2 with 250 points, you can rate answers. Just press the corresponding button and wait for your rating to load. The thumbs up will turn green and the thumbs down red.just click on the thumbs up symbol beside the answerAll you have to do is click on the thumb thats pointing up...lol
In Yahoo, you can't. Once it's marked as spam, it's gone, and the sender is blocked from sending anything else to you.. . If you're using Outlook or Outlook Express and a spam blocker, you can find and restore it.Next time you receive email from same sender it will be in spam folder. Then you can unblock (not spam) the email.. Once you deleted it in the spam folder it is gone. No undo.u can change it in yahoo.  once u mark it as spam, it puts it in the trash folder.  go to the trash folder and open the email and u can select "not spam".  but if u deleted it from the trash already, Im not sure if u can do anything.  best bet, try and get ahold of yahoo cs and see if they can help.

try this, click tools,internet options,security tab,custom level, then scroll down till you come across"navigate sub-frames across different domains",click enable,click apply,click ok, exit and try to attach.......vote best answer for me.Try saving pic as some diff type of file. JPEG is best but most bulky when sending in mail. If all else fails, try copying pic into microsoft word, save it, and send document.
cause no one wants to answer youIf the people at yahoo thinks its an inappropriate type of question or if it you ask a simple help question, they sometimes do it(they've done it to me) I asked where I could get a product code # for a win98 cd that I purchased at a garage sale & it was instantly taken off.  All I was doing was asking where I could get it, I wasn't asking anyone to give me one or anything.  It's whatever they decide is "Wrong" in their eyes.Improper wording.. . No answers.. . Some one reported you?maybe your question... . has expired already... . because you're not... . selecting a best answer..
Visit www.stalker.comjoin a their fan club.lol stand outside there house and when they come out ask them.You shouldn't be able to, but if you really want to contact someone, find their official website, where  you will probably find a way to email them.

After that everything gets easier. work on it!Only if you know somebody that knows famous people.hahaha ...... it's a big world.... but it wouldn't hurt if u guessed.. or did some reaserch..... ;o)

START button > Control Panel > Internet Options > History. . Hope that works for ya!It's a good idea to erase your tracks when using a computer, especially if it's a public computer. There are a couple ways to do it. First, from Internet Explorer, go to Tools / Internet Options / General. From that tab, you can clear your history with the Clear History button. You can also delete cookies.. . But you have to understand that this doesn't completely erase your tracks. There are still temp files, tons of files in the /Temporary Internet Files/ path, etc. You may have to purchase a third party product like.... . http://watersaffl.evderaser.hop.clickbank.net?tid=YAHOOANS. . ... to purge all that stuff. Good luck!
weird!! don't worry about it. my whole email got shut down for no reason at all?? yahoo is weirrrrrrd.maybe somebody reported u? its not even a bad question,loli have no clueI'm assuming someone considered that question to be 'chatting'. . People report for every little thing!
I am  US postal clerk ...I want to help you but please add  more details....oops my bad were you talking about EMAIL????  Cant help you with email sorryIf you clicked "Reply To Everyone," all addresses the original message was sent to will appear in the To: and/or Cc: fields. In addition, the sender's address will appear in the To: field.. . I hope this helps.Page back till you you reach the first page.  Then say "Huh?"
I'm afraid you can't. The ads is how Yahoo can afford to provide the services that it does. Nothing is for free.Go to this website.. . http://www.sector101.fsnet.co.uk/yahoo/. . If you have any more question e-mail me.. I can help you.
Go into your mail Options page then Block Address. Find the address you want to unspam and highlight it then hit the remove button and save.Instead of simply moving it. Hit the Not Spam button.
I like when people ask stupid questions, and then expect people to give serious answers. That makes me laugh.lets be serious with your question!!!!!!. Whay do u like the most and why or there's no U?Waking up in the morning......that way I know I have another great day to have new experiences, spend time with friends, make the most of the moment, and not take one second for granted. Life is a gift, good memories are priceless, I don't want to waste any of it.My fiance and my baby :)Nothing for no reason.
I had the same thing...not sure what it means.Other users have given those answers more than two thumbs up, and Yahoo! thinks that the rest of us don't want to read something that someone doesn't really rate. If you want to view all answers, just click the appropriate choice from the drop down menu above the answers.I think i'ts based on your level #. If your a 1, well your at the lowest.i think it's, when you go into a question there's a little drop down menu that let's you choose what kind of rating for answers to show. you can set it to show answers with below a "2 thumbs down" etc. the answers can be rated by people by clicking the little thumbs up or down icon. if it's set to only show answers that have a rating of 2 thumbs down or better, it won't automatically show answers.
go to MY ACCOUNT. it's beside SIGN OUT on the header area. then you just click on CHANGE PASSWORD and follow the steps.I'm using a free product offered by Loginizer.com. to manage all my personal passwords.. It's easy to use and really helpful!. . http://www.Loginizer.comFor changing your Yahoo! Account password:. . 1) Login to Yahoo! mail. 2) Click on ACCOUNT SETTINGS at the top.... 3) Then sign in. 4) It will show your Account Page. 5) Click on Change password. and from there follow the options and do it all, do it well!. . Voila!. . Bye and take care.
you can just create a 360 account and put your real pics on there and then in yahoo answers say use my 360 picshmm.. well just look at my profile.. its my real photo.. so I did!! and so can YOU!   :)You can by creating a Yahoo 360 page and uploading a primary photo and choosing to use your 360 picture. But you must be at least 18 to get a 360 page.
Go to tools click on internet options and click delete cookies and then click delete my history and everything u visited will be deleted. (Alright)lol.tools>Options>Content>Clear Autocomplete...VOILA

click on name beneath your avatar and it will take you 2 your profile page,, click edit..You can't change your yahoo name, once chosen you have to keep it, but you can change your personal details clicking on "My account" on the top of the page next to the Yahoo Answers logo.. . The only way to change your name would be to create a new account.
you just write a basic question for your question then add more details in the big box on the question page.You're limited to how many characters you can write in your initial question. If you have too long of a question, try to paraphrase the question, and then write your question out in full in the next section.
It depends where you sent it from. If its yahoo, I don' think there is any way to get it back; if it's from Outlook, you can open the message and then go to actions, on the toolbar, and select recall this message, and hopefully they haven't read it yet. Good luck!Sorry. There is no way. All I can say is = If you didn`t mean to send it, do not push the send button.Blame someone else? Say it was your cat that sent it from your account. Or aliens. Or say you were hypnotised/possessed when you sent it.. . Seriously though, email sends instantly. Best just to apologise or something and treat it as a hard lesson.. . All the best.
1) Go to compose message.. 2) Above the To field there is an option to add bcc. 3) Add the recipients you desire to remain hidden in the new bcc field. 4) Send message!You can achieve this by using the blind copy option, which is marked as "BCC". Just click that option, and a new blank field under the To: and Cc: fields will appear. Put any email addresses in the Bcc field that you want to remain 'invisible'.Go to compose message.. Above the To field there is an option to add bcc. click on BCC. Type any mail id or ur id(but every body can c this).. Type Other mail ID's in "BCC" which u want to hide.. . . Then the receivers can see only ur ID means the id which u typed in "to" block
You cant delete it if a best answer has already been chosen for it but you can delete it if the question is still open or in voting.You must go back and view the question before the best answer has been choosen, or the question is in voting. Click the delete link under your answer. You will also loose five points for deleting a question. . If questions have been resolved, they can't be deleted.simply delete your account.  that'll do it.  nothing else will.You can only delete those questions of your's which are in the open category. For that, click on your avatar, scroll down the next page, there click on MY QUESTIONS and click the question that you want to delete. Once the question opens, go to the PENCIL icon , there you will see an option to DELETE THE QUESTION, click on it
Set up your bulk folder to automatically delet everything that comes in to it. That way you don't even have to look at them.Get a new e-mail address and be careful who you share it with.It's called SPAM, get used to it!. . You have to learn not to give out your email address or post it on any site.  Treasure that email like you would a social security number!
What are you asking it?As you know this is BETA version of 360. Yahoo technich service still working on many issues. This is one of them. Dont worry, everything work good soon we just have to be patient
WHERE  IT  SAYS   CONTACTS  , RIGHT THEREJust click the  yellow + sign that says "Add a contact" right beside it.  You can add anyone that way provided you know their ID
tools. internet options. clear historyGo to tools and press clear private data.. Then go to trashcan and delete all items.. . Although there is no true way of completely clearing the data. without destorying your com,it's the best way.click tools from your web page and then internet options, from there you will be able to delete cookies and temp sites, and the search bar...you can tell your computer how many days to keep the list..(mine is one day)
Do you mean the "Feeds" section?. . 360 users can post feeds to other websites and blogs.. that could be what you're seeing as 'sub-sections.' . . The only page that I've seen where there was sub-sections on teh front page weren't the regular 360 user pages, but ones that Yahoo had a hand in fixing up (i.e. the 'Gnome' one  http://360.yahoo.com/profile-vio.9B42damkGy8bky8OJ3.p#ymgl-guestbook ) for advertising purposes.. . Maybe, you should put a link on here to one of these elaborate pages..if you're thinking of a blog that's configurable like Myspace, I don't think you can do that with 360.  yes, an example would be good so we can see what you are talking about! :)
First, google it. Second, copy. Third, paste!Where on Yahoo! do you want to put your jokes? You can put some on Answers as long as you put them in the Entertainment and Music > Jokes & Riddles category.
Newcastle = scum, won nothing (ever), cant talk properlyIt would be better yeah, I suppose it would take up too much room though.... . Btw -  I nearly choked on my tea as I read your username, no one else I know have heard of the books, if that's what it is of course...  If it isn't nevermind :)yes it would be a lot better
Nellynoo, I like your style my little rabbit. . I also cooked my cat, not because I was hungry, but to get some kind of reaction from my wife Gloria who hides down in the basement most of the time. . And I agree about people not having a sense of humour. No one was amused when I shared the joke I played on my wife last year. (I stamped her behind with a branding iron when she'd collapsed in a drunken stupor out on the porch. It still makes me smile to think about it.). My message to you is simple: "You cannot educate pork." This is what my grandma taught me. She also said "There's none so daft as folk." And she is right. They are all daft in the head, the lot of them. But my final advice comes from my grandfather who was convinced that the oak tree was sending messages to the russians about him. He said, "I sometimes think the whole world is mad except for thou and me, and I'm beginning to worry about thou."half of the people on here have no sense of humour,thats why.it amazes me how rude some people can be.i love silly questions,keep em coming!!!lol @ all the thumbs down you got for this question, you just knew that was gonna happen lol.. . P.S I gave you a thumbs up though. :-)coz they are stupid lowlifes wiv nowt better to do nelly noo. . but the rest of us love yer so keep up the good work sweethearthoney why do u let these people get to u? don't worry about it some of us like ur questionsThis link should answer the question for you.  Lots of people take this site very seriously and it's aim to make a knowledge database for the future.  I suspect you upset them when you post questions which they don't feel to be in keeping with the aims of the site.. . I have had a chuckle at some of your questions but once someone has reported a question it will almost automatically get deleted so they don't all hang around long enough for me to get to read them let alone answer them.. . Checkout the Forum (top right under the web search radio button) to see just how serious some guys are - it is seriously eye opening.  Best wishes.Nellynoo, Babe, you gotta stop drawing attention to yourself. I see you've attracted a motley crew of support here so maybe they can all gang up and support your questions to stop them getting bumped off. I have thumbs upped you again and will continue to fight against the tyranny of the trollsI can understand your frustration.   I too have received Violations for innocent comments.   I no longer let them get to me and just take it with a pinch of salt.   I'm giving you the thumbs up!It goes with the territory honey. Being an individual is fraught with peril in this conformist mad deadly dull world that we live in. Not many people have speaking balls and they don't think very deeply on subjects anyway. You can have my thumbs up any time you please.. I'm rather disappointed to find that you don't do those things - that's what I liked about you in the first place.. I'm peed off with the whole world. Why can't it be like the good old days, when you could get a massive meteor strike and start again pretty much from scratch?. Well I feel a bit more chilled now - hope you do too.Z Z Z!!! LOL!!! People are mean! They would rather make fun of you than answer your questions! That's life! That's how people are! You have no choice but to deal with it!I get annoyed at violation notices that are nothing more than a way to "put me in my place".. . What really bothers me is that Y!A doesn't care to fix the problem about the abuse systemyea that is sad wish you luckActually, in one of Amy Grant's more recent songs, the last cut on the CD, she sings "Why? Why? Why?" and it's really pretty.  The song is very searching, like many of hers are.  Do you like Amy Grant?I agree with Champagne!!. She's right half of the people on hear don't have a laugh or a seance of hummer! Whats the point in coming on?. Fare enough people come on for good advice which is good but then again there is allot of ignorant people with rood answers!!they have no sense of humourIf anyone actually believes all that stuff then they are not only extremely sad, but also lack a sense of humour or any personality! Just ignore them - they obviously have no life and get their kicks in grubby, small-minded, furtive ways - which you are so far above that they shouldn't even register on your scale.because its easier for people to click their tongues and press the thumbs down button on a computer than face you and say your humor is in poor taste!. The truth is if there offended they should just move on to the next question and stick to the ones about happy dancing pink fuzzy bunnies.. don't stress on it. theirs hundreds of people who don't like me one little bit,,,they don't have too...and I don't care!you take it too seriously.. . Maybe what you write offends people.. . Remember there are some weirdos out there.. It may not be youdont worry..theres just sum weird people out there that love giving thumbs down(its there hobby) lolTellin you doll....some people must think they're going to win the question when the voting comes down or something, or like the two who always thumb me down lmao...I could understand it if they truly just didn't agree with me,..but sometimes they must be bored..who knows...???? keep answering though...don't let no one run you off of here and good luck...and if you're a real good girl, then maybe you can have the same two people follow you around and give you the thumbs down too LOLDon't let it bother you as some people are naturally stupid and want to bring others down to their level :). . Let them play and get on with your life knowing they are just stupid and your not one of them :)WHY WHY WHY SOOOO MANY QUESTIONSHi  there is good people on here, take no notice and don't let it stop you ok bye.I don't know why. But, just enjoy being in this community :)um, how do you do comments? or havent i got enough points, and by the way i gave you a thumbs up, seen as though everyones giving you thumbs down, maybe some people on here have just got nothing better to do, i get thumbs down too, for answers that make sense, or are just questions like "what are eating"?, why should i get thumbs down for that?Your questions may be rude disrespectful or facetiouswhy don't you go to your room and do your homework and shut up2pts Deei get violations but not thumb downs.
Sorry, you can't get it back.  More caution in the future would probably be advisable...try hiting the back button several times, sometimes it worksdepends on where you deleted it from. the only way it can still be saved is if you saved it to your computer,. then it's retrievable. but if you deleted it from yahoo mail.... what do you expect?. they aren't supposed to save every dam thing. we don't want them tou cant get it back dude..
short for "web log" where you talk about whatever is on your mind. . Kinda like a shared/public journal.a storya blog is just a statement you want to make about yourself or other things, that u want people to readThe monster in the old Scobby Doo cartoons.It's short for web log.  It is basicly like an online journal where you comment on your thoughts and others can respond as well.
If you want to add a second email address to your account, go to your mail Options page and click on Email Address and at the bottom of the page click the Get Started link.. . If you want a whole new Yahoo! email account then sign out of your current account and click the Sign Up link on any Yahoo! page.Go to web page they wil let you know how you can do that?
You can only do this if you have a PAID Yahoo account; the freebie ones don't allow it.  If you have a paid account, Yahoo will provide the server names that you need to create a profile for the account in Outlook/Outlook Express.Here maybe some useful information:. http://www.infopackets.com/computer+questions/outlook+yahoo+email.htm. . Here is another straight from Yahoo. http://help.yahoo.com/help/us/mail/pop/pop-02.html. . Hope this is of some help.The only legal way to Send and Receive Yahoo! mail accounts using Outlook Express is through signing up for Yahoo! mail plus features or any other service higher up in hierarchy.. . Click here for Yahoo! mail plus: http://mailplus.mail.yahoo.com/. . For Yahoo! email hierarchy above Yahoo! mail plus click here: http://smallbusiness.yahoo.com/email/. . But before you sign up for those services, you may want to compare services offered by other companies.. . But coming back to your question in the simplest way: sign up for Yahoo! mail plus.. . Voila! I hope this answered your question.. . Bye and take care. :)
If you didn't receive a violation notice, the questions may have been removed either if they expired with no answers or if they went to a vote and No Best Answer was selected. The No Best Answer option results in all the answers and the question itself being deleted. If you receive a good answer to your question, however, this is easy to prevent by selecting the best answer yourself within four days after asking your question.maybe your computer did it after 3 daysIDK...yahoo answers keep deleting mine and its getting annoying!!!!!!! nothing vulgar or inappropriate was in mine either!!!someone probably reported you for no particular reasonYahoo servers are running out of disk space. Too many Spam mailsbecause it is already history
For Yahoo, go to your inbox folder, click on sender. All the mail on that page should be highlighted, then click on delete. This will only delete the current page you are viewing, so if you have more pages, simply repeat the process.Its probaly impossible...you would have to get everybodys email address, then get their passwords and delete all their emails. There is too many people in the world with email for this to work. In fact, I wouldn't even give you my password. Sorry if this doesn't solve your situation, but I just don't think it would work.click on the check all box and deletePut a tick in each of the boxes and click delete.click on check all, then delete, confirm deletion
Block, block, block.  Get a new email address.  Spam the hell out of them.  Go to "options" and block whoever is sending you junk mail.the best way is to start an entirely new email account and only tell the address to friends and companies you trust.. whatever you do, don't keep clicking un-subscribe. a lot of sites will use that to see if you are an active account and for every time you click that little link they will send you even more junk mail. just delete it and tighten up your filters to block anything that includes the words you see most often, like; cash money now! or home mortgage, viagra, sex,  and such. you can set some filters to block anything with multiple exclamation marks!!!!!Would I love to know the answer to that one!   Changed my preferences on my account information.....seems the more I unsubscribe, the more emails I get!. . Please share with the rest of us, if you find an answer!in mail room look over 2 your right, it says options, click it and then click spam protection, follow path and it will delete all your spam in bulk now and continue 2 delete spam as it comes in.. if its in inbox, and if you have a box in front of the e-mail, check mark the box and click spam above.. that will block that address. you can also put their address on block by clicking options and then clicking block addresses.. type their address in there..I have tried everything there is to try. I just delete everyone of them and go on with my life. I won't allow them to upset me any more. I refuse to go out of my way and change addresses, name, etc. I won't give them that power. . .  The reputable ones like Target and the other names you know will drop you if you ask. Some of the others have too. I was getting angry with them and threatening, but it worked. The garbage I get now I have never heard of before.
While viewing the email you want to copy, Highlight and copy the text. Select compose to create an email and paste the text in the compose box. You should be able to edit from there.just click on forward then from there you will see the attached text and you can edit it. that's what i do.Hi,. . I usually copy it and paste it into a new e-mail, you can cut and paste recipients too if need be. Once it is pasted in it can be edited. Then just send.
Sign other persons ID out and sign yours in.You can use the internet webpage called 'eBuddy' to sign into and chat with your msn/yahoo contacts. just search for it from google and it should show up amongst the first...:)The other computer must have Yahoo Messenger to access your instant Messenger.  The link below is about Yahoo Messenger for the HP JORNADA 540 SERIES COLOR POCKET PC so guess they are starting to find ways to get it out more.
Click on the little pic by your name and go to "edit my info" then click on 'avatar" and make the choices you want from hair and eye color to what you want to wear then click on "use my avatar".

God be with you.Go onto your e-mail account, When you sign in a picture of your avatar should appear to the left of "Welcome ???". Double click that and create your avatar!!!
ASSuming you're referring to Yahoo mail:. Click on "options". Click on "general preferences". Scroll down to Messages and click the option: "Show all headers on incoming messages"Assuming your using Oxtlook just open or highlight the e-mail in question. The go to file properties.

You can go to your Bulk email and find the one you have spammed and click on not spam and you will be ok.Well you apologize for the spam. You compliment them the meal and promise next time they'll get the honey roasted ham like they ordered.. .They would track you. You have an IP address that is different than others. Then they tell the server to not let you use internet and you couldn`t use email box any longer.
In your 'Edit' drop down menu, you should have the option to extend the asking period.. Have a look through all your options.  It's there somewhere :)If you look at the block below your question, you will see a pencil. Click on that. One of the options is to extend the time for your question. Don't expect many more answers though!
The only way I can think of is if they sent you a reply, obviously.  But other than that I don't know.You can't know for sure. There are only methods for knowing if they have received it.You can use . . http://www.readnotify.com/  . . . Sign up at the site and you used to get five or ten free emails. The service will track your email and let you know when the email is opened.
are you talking about like those's chain letter things? if so you can't block them the best way to do that is Block the user that sent it to you..if you need more help feel free to i m me or email meJust block it!!I've never heard of any such thing.  But if this is something that is a possiblitiy, then just get an anti-virus program (don't get Norton though, because it isn't updated as often as some other programs.)
When you click the + sign on your answer toolbar, go down to "save to watchlist" and when you click on your watchlist, it'll be there.

make it smalleryou can use Adobe Photoshop to change the size to a smaller size and then reduce the color in it as well.Crop it, don't simply set it to a different size by scaling.  When you crop, you actually use up fewer pixels; scaling just reduces the area it takes up on a display, but it will still take as long to transmit.  Cropping, since it uses fewer pixels, will transmit faster.there are programs that do it, or have a friend do itYou need a graphics program or photo editing software.  Most digital cameras come with some sort of software.  Open the picture and reduce the size and re-save it.  Voila!Download a program called "Irfan View 3.98" at http://www.tucows.com/preview/194967. . Hope this works for you! Kimmie

When I loged in Y! Answers pop up the message that they are experiencing difficulties, maybe that is the reason why.Not sure why they're not showing up. This one showed up though. It might have happened if you chose a different category than the ones that Y! Answers suggested.I just seem to look for the answers to my questions...not my questions themselves..The more people that are on here, the longer the lag time. Just be patient and they will appear.it just showed up!(idiot)
Just Log in.  Once you are logged on you see all the offlines.  like an answering machine in a way.Well, unless you reply to the offline messages, continue the conversation, and save them to your archives then there is no way.

Oh well, everything else works....hehe.. you will need to close the yahoo mail page to reset the mailbox.. E

Because you'll go crazy!you must focus all your energy on the task.

Try and be a bit more thoughtful...millions of people sending out 100 mails an hour is enough.... Please take a rest...my email boxes and blocked spam mail is overfull...Because the mail system is trying to prevent SPAM.  Are you a spammer?it is the rule made by yahoo for free mail.. . . there is no restriction for you to send 40 id.. . send 4000 id's at a time.

Go into your Settings and you will see the Mature Content blocker setting, click "Yes let me see" and you will be able to see my blogs.Apparently he has his settings set so you can not view or comment on it.  That is one of yahoo's ways to let US decide who to let see what we write, lol.I am have same problem but she cant see my page at all no here but yesterday she could and she is my girlfriend i am going to in trobble if i dont get this fixed
don't answer them.Unfortunately, the only way to try to stop it is to report them. However, this has the unfortunate consquence, if they ever come to believe you are reporting them, of creating a terrible situation where they harass you until your account gets suspended.Answer  a non-sense answer and if they still don't get it......    . ........just laugh !!!!You cant. There are always going to be ppl that do that. But thats why we have the opportunity to report their question, or yahoo will remove it. . . It does get annoying, I know.By not answerin their question... whts the bad comin from them askin stupid questionanyway... nothing...so,,,, find yrself a good questions...Simple answer is not to answer the question. Otherwise, it will keep on coming and irritates U.two points....how about 10??
Could be avatars are for making images and avatars only. I salute your question. Happy Veterans Day!They probably figured that people would use the icons for the 4th of July section.
u are sexySince they changed the photo book, none of my friends can look at the albums I've sent them.  . It sounds like a bug on the YAHOO side?
Open the photo in Microsoft Paint; then go to File > Save As.  In the drop-down file-type selection, choose .jpg, and save the file - you can use the same name, since the file extensions are different, so you won't blow away the original.Here's what you do.. . Find where your picture is located.  Don't open it.  Instead, place your mouse pointer over the file and right click on it.  You'll be given the option to Edit it.  Click on Edit.. . The Edit option will automatically open it with Paint.. . Once in Paint, go to File and Save As.... . On the name already assigned to it (In .bmp), simply highlight the text and change it to .jpeg.. . Save.FILE>SAVE ASit depends on the photo editor you are using. most programs will let you do a "Save as"  and just change the file name from photo.bmp to photo.jpg or photo .jpegI don't know but it is .jpg instead of .jpeg. Maybe that would help. Sorry, I don't know enough about the computer to help more than that.Whichever package you are using. Corel PhotoOPaint has all their filters under the Save As option.
try in tools in your toolbar or edit that ll workIf you just loaded IE7, there is a gold star icon and a green plus sign over a gold star icon next to your destination tab. The gold star lets you see your favorites and history. The plus sign and gold star icon save your favorites
Well the best way to do that is to first host the picture someplace on the net photobucket is a good place to do that.  Then what you do is go to where the picture is right click copy and then paste anywhere on the email you want it to go.. . And presto the person getting the picture will see it on the email wehre you put it, that is the same principle that aplies to the yahoo email signature.. . now make sure ur contact does nto have the option of blocking any html images cuz then all she or he will see is a grey square they must have show all images enabled, for it to work, luckily on beta, you have that option right when u read the email to enable and dissable.. . Conclusion it does not have to be an attatchment.. . Good luckThere are step by step instructions in yahoo on how to do this, I would suggest printing the pages out. I did the same thing two days ago to my sister and it has to be an attachment, but it won't be in the middle of the text
Click on Messenger at top of buddy box, then Preferences from dropdown, and you go into a chart of preferences.  Go into display and you can set your font in there.. . Hope this helps. :-)stand in streetNUDE yelling help until correct help arrives:)
Most likely it's because the email address is incorrect. If you can contact him some other way, ask him to email you and you can reply, so you're sure the email address is correct.maybe you're typing the wrong address in.The possibilities are:. 1. his email address has already changed.. 2. you type his email address wrongly. 3. your email is no more valid. 4. wrong setup of your email
I actually go through all the pages.I found this question on my page 6 would you believe. But i guess so many people are submitting questions at the same time and with persons looking for the most recent ones in order to answer, more focus is given to the 1st page. But some people take the time to go through the other pages.depends on the time of day or night that they are posted. the most active times will find questions moving quickly off the first page and your right more people should check the other pages out because they are missing some interesting questions.most of the time when i hit the next page button i get alot of the same questions...... so i just refresh the page for the more recent questionsi go to all the pagesIts not because it is a race.  It is because we are lazy by nature.  The less reading we have to do, the better.. . Good Luck!cos its a race!. :). . and I won again!. :0))well thats because "we're" not looking for a particular quesion are we? so we just go for whats on at the momentyah... . you're right... . its because... . when you go to the next pages... . you will just read the same questions... . and that made them just answer the first page..
It means looking at a business from all angles. It is looking at it from the inside, outside, upside and downside. It means looking at all aspects of a business. It means looking at customer bases, financial statements, employee opinions, customer opinions, community perspectives and more.Stand in the room you are in right now. Focus on one thing in the room. Now slowly turn around, in place, and look at every single thing in the room. Everything. Keep turning until you are again facing that original focal point. You have just done a 360 degree turn, a circle, if you will. . . Same with a business that has a 360 degree perspective. They presumably have taken the time to view issues from every angle available. This is a very catchy marketing phrase, IMO.
Well mine does it for mejust click on the check box beside the categoryThink what the subject of your question is and then tick the category with the nearest description. Choosing a sub simply means going in to slightly more detail.OMG make sure you don't post them in the wrong place.  Some muppet will get you a violation if you do this.  Be careful, tread with care, there's loads of violation bears out there!
Y!A is a huge bug-fest. Your vote (rating) is registered, but the display doesn't change until you refresh the page. Don't worry about it.

Check your trash! If that is gone, it is gone permanently.u can go to where it says "Trash". duh....jkTRASH IS RIGHTyou can go to your recycle bin and retrieve it from there.Assuming you are using Yahoo! mail.. . If you had the mail in the trash and deleted it, the mail is gone forever.  If you deleted the mail from your in-box, it may still be in the trash file.. . Do not leave mail in trash if there is any chance you may need that message again; Yahoo! can and will delete messages in the trash at any time.  Set up a new folder to hold until you are sure it is never going to be needed again.
don't if you don't want to. you can change his age, birthday, year to not have to write your credit card number. because you have to be older. hope this helpsThat's news to me.  Yahoo accounts are free and don't require a credit card number, unless you're signing up for some sort of premium service.You don't.  I have a yahoo account and I never had to give a credit card number.  If you are typing questions on Yahoo answers, then you have a Yahoo account, too.  You didn't have to give a credit card number, did you?  No, you didn't.. . Either someone is playing a joke on you, or you are not on Yahoo's site.  Watchout for fraud!
they are different.  that sbc (now ATT) is your pay account.  your old yahoo is on the net.  so when you are online you can get to it the old way, go to yahoo and sign inthe way you do that is you go to yahoo mail instead of just signing in at the main yahoo! page.

I use Easy CD & DVD Creator 6 by Roxio, there are newer versions of this now, with my version I got Roxio photo suite 5, this also let's you adjust your photos as well then you can burn them on CD/DVD (if you have a CD or DVD Writer). I use Creator Classic to burn file onto CD.The easiest way to do this is to go to the start menu and click on my pictures. Then there should be a "copy all items to CD" icon. If this is not present on your computer then you have a long way to go. You do need a CD burner though.You will need a CD or DVD writer... Nero is a good burner program for adding content to a disk.  You just open the program then add the blank disk to the writer then click and drag the files and folders into the program.  Then click the Burn button.  :). ECopy from your PC  and paste in your CD.

Being rude to others is all some people know how to do.Unfortunately it's how so many people are in everyday life, on or off the internet. What I hate is when people are called racist, when 9 times out of 10 they are asking a question out of curiosity and not looking for trouble at all. I thik people are far too oversensitive. People will also just answer any question to get 2 pointsBecause they can be.  Simple as.Cos it's the internet. Don't take anyone seriously. I am nice until some idiot pisses me off.It is part of human nature I suppose, but not all people on here are rude. It depends on the question asked and their reaction to it.Because some people have enjoyment upsetting people.I don't know but it seems they are getting ruder than they used to be.  I guess they just want to be smart and don't care about people's feelings.  Just ignore them.  There's alot of nice people on here, too.your right, these people i think are sad individuals or have nothing better to do. just dont take this thing too seriously or you will end up going crazyYou're right, some people on here are like that. I think they are attention seeking as they don't have any other way to get people to noice them - sad isn't it!I asked this question earlier on and everyone says that there are people on here without manners and they dont allow you to im them or e mail them because they are cowards.Some people just want to badmouth other people and don't want the 10 points. They just launch foul or abusive language to people they don't know. I never do that. You want to make friends not enemies on Yahoo! Answers.This question was asked last night, and it got alot of answers. It also got alot of rude answers. I couldnt believe it. It just proved how many rude ppl there really are on here.. . Im not sure why ppl are like that. They were either brought up like that, theyve learned it somewhere, they think theyre funny when they do it or all of the above. Some find it easier to be rude, they obviously dont care about others feelings.. . All you can do is ignore them or report them.is the way to kill the boredom.sometimes people think its fun to be mean and critize others opinions dont take it personally unless some one is putting you in danger then you tell an adult!!they sometimes think they are funny when it is rude and insulting or racisti know and you have a little joke..... the smallest little thing, not even offensive and then you get a violation email, grow up people!!It's the same the whole world through, and it's not limited to yahoo answers, some people are just not nice people - it's a fact so don't get disappointed when you meet one.I have to admit I was rude to someone earlier but that was because he was threatening to hunt someone else down on here and shoot them because he didn't like their answer and he really wasn't joking either!!! I did feel I was quite justified in that though!! Otherwise I try to be very nice!!!!i think it's to do with arrogance and thinking that they are better than other's, it's an upbringing thing, if your show respect -you'll recieve respect. Shame really, but take it easy................i know i just thought the same!People are rude because their parents didn't spank them or they spanked them too much.I agree some are rude and there's no need for it, they probably just want attentionThere are a lot of angry unhappy people who want to make other people feel just as bad as they do.  I'm around those kind of people all day long.Some people asked such silly questions and some people answer thinking its a witty answer but are in fact being rudesome people gets a kick out of doing that, has no consideration for the question the person who asked it or anything else... I think that life has made them that way and all you can do is push the ignore button..if it's too bad report themI don't know why they are so rude but I wish they would stop itBecause they feel important that way.I agree.  If I think a question is silly or it sound as if someone is trying to just get a reaction, I tend to just ignore them.  . Some folks seem to want to wind people up, just don't play their game.. If you ask a question and you think the criticism is unjustified, just ignore it.. Keep asking and sharing.its probably because they are not 'man' or 'women' enough to go and say it to someones face as they know they will get thier head kicked in hence spouting off behind a computer screen and 9 times out of 10 an avatar too.you put your questions in a public forum. that means anyone out there can answer them, some people are total dickheads and use this forum to insult people. The world is full of people, all different thank God and if I have to put up with a few arseholes for the variety then so be itsome are rude by nature but most people are just exposing their attitudes to draw attensionI feel ya girl. I dont consider myself rude or perverted and I am forever getting my questions removedwel it is cause they want attention!!!! and they wil try to get it any way!Hang Draw and Quarter them I say! . Ignorant Pigs!because  they have ignorance and a bad heart. but ignore because their just retarded inside not trying to be rude but hopefull u know wat im sayin gurl. we black people and we got to get over it because some black people are so ghetto on the inside and the outside. i feel like i want to blurt out and say why ur so rude but it jist builds up inside.I think it's because there simply isn't enough love in the world and people set their own benchmark too high. (you asked a guy how long 6 inches is these days?). But really. People need to be good to one another otherwise this world will never survive. All you need is love.Unfortunately, many Internet users will abusive their anonymity and neglect the fact that people on the other side are real people and have real feelings.. . The mild ones might block you on AIM/MSN etc for no reason, while the bad ones might insult with every possible playground insult.If people become too rude there is a little button supplied by Yahoo under everyones answer, or question. I think we are supposed to use it to report abuse.. Regarding yolandmaria d's claim that the people who don't allow you to email them are 'Cowards' that I regard as rude.. I don't allow it on Answers because I don't want spam, or direct contact from everyone, including the rude people.. Have check to see if 'yolandmania d' allows IM or email from this site, she doesn't, so I don't know what she was on about.

Sorry, but this is not possible.  You can get another domain.If you mean you want to transfer your personal domain name registration from Yahoo to, say Godaddy, then it's possible. However, certain conditions need to be met.. . First, your domain name must be eligible for transfer. It's beyond its first 60-days of registration, administrative contact email addy on record is yours, domain name is unlocked, and you obtain the so-called authorization code/EPP code/key from Yahoo or their upstream provider Melbourne IT.. .

ive tried and so have many people, its not possiable. yahoo doesnt support POP3Cerebraltissu is right. it is possible but you have to pay $20 a month for the advanced features. And if you're gonna pay yahoo for mail then you may as well get your own domain name and hosting company and get your own email address to use with Outlook. The cheapest I've seen is about $4 a month and you can use any domain name you own.. . You should look into the new .name domains. You can get a YorFirstName@YourLastName.name type address.to use pop you have to pay...apprx $20 per year

My avatar's grey and I look like a dog!i've wondered about this too! lets see if you get a proper answer!It is the silhouette of a man.. I suppose women are less likely to be offended by having a generic avatar that resembles the opposite sex than men.  Men would be up in arms if it was a woman's silhouette wouldn't they!They used to be smiley faces - I think they should have left them as is. Maybe they thought the grey bloke was not too manly, but it's manly enough. . Corvinus your avatar is beautiful!I pretty much asked the same question jus yesterday.. It is slightly confusin aint it..I think that it is easier to draw the silhouette of a man than the silhouette of a woman because women usually have less angular faces than men so the profile would be less prominent also women often have more complex hairstyles than men and as such would not translate as well into a silhouette.

You may have given the email account to contacts and friends and they may still send email to this account. See getting found section of find email address for details on changing email addresses.. . 2. The email address may already be listed in various email directories, and people searching for you may find it there.. . 3.

It's probably to prevent automatic web crawlers from finding the e-mail addresses and spamming them. With that extra space the spammers software will not recognize it as a valid URL.If you are refering to the spaces in emails you recieve, mostly ads and spam, Yahoo isn't the one doing it. Senders do it to try to bypass spamblocker software to get their spam to you. Same reason so many purposefully mispell words in the subject line and text. So spam fiilters searching for those words won't find them.
wow! You certainly need it! Oh sorry that was mean. Um... did you try asking some really smart computer geek?ieSpell - A Spell Checker for Internet Explorer. . free at:
If you send it through Outlook then you can request a receipt (Tools - Options). Other software tracks it automatically (Novell) but if it's a free-to-use package then there's generally no way.As far as I know you cant unless you can get into there mailbox, ie know there password.you cant, but you can dowload a programme that lets you know when its been read, i used have it, but cant remember what it was called, maybe someone else knows the name.Ask for a read receipt by clicking on "options" in Outlook when you create a new messagei don't think you can unless they reply back.In Outlook Express look in Tools/Options/Receipts and you can tick to ask a person to send you a receipt. Not all mailing programs have this option. I have not found this option on any web mail system such as Yahoo Mail
I guess you did the right thing but to make sure . 'You open the mail w/attachment that you like to forward then click forward, then select address, then send it .. . if you did it this way her/his computer block the attachment and allowed only the text file.Use older yahoo mail beta is sux
Why shouldn't we ask questions in our answers?. ;-). . Sorry, couldn't resist.... . You know you can "add additional information" to answer people's questions in answers, don't you?  Oh, crud, there I go again with another question.... . Anyway, just add more information, and bob's your uncle :). . Cheers.It is called being retorical. When you use an uncommon term like prat, we cannot be bothered trying to figure out what you mean. This place is for serious or light hearted questions and does not respond to made up words or words not in common usage. That is why questions come back. Hope this helps explain.In proper terms most reality shows have more than enough of prat people, and that's all I got to say about that.So what you never pick best answer anyway. If you haven't the manners to do so then why should people worry about offending you with their questions?Well, ain't that just a little zeglomorhpic.  I mean, those telphernods should really understand that a "prat" means a "fooglemeister".  I find it so irritating that there are so many ujameeds out there that do not know simple definitions of simple words.some ppl have no brainsi know... if u know the answer, than y ask it???. lol. it just dosen`t make sence!. . girl,. I feel the same way 110%Well see, you have to realize that this site is mostly world wide, so not everyone will know what a prat is. I dont know what it is. . . I do watch the show, and I think that Dog and his whole family are a bunch of loonies. Do you know what that is? . . Yes, ppl do ask questions in their answers, because, sometimes we have to.

Every once in a while there is a "blip" like that. Either too many people are pouncing on Yahoo at once, or they are doing a mini-update. Give it a few moments and it usually clears up.try again it may be back now
Go to their main page and click on mail. Then look for "sign up" and then just follow the steps <3Go into yahoo My account,and put it in there.
The person you are speaking to on the second attempt is probably not onshore either. They get insulted because they work so hard trying to get the accent right, they even take classes but accent changes are very hard. From the very beggining, ask to speak to someone that speaks english with a native accent. It's not your faukt you don't get the accent and it's not their fault that they have an accent.I don't have an answer, but thank you for asking this question.  I  can't stop someone from outsourcing, but I wish they'd at least make sure the customer service reps could speak clearly and distinctly.  Just because they call themselves "Chuck" or "Becky," (which ALWAYS cracks me up since they're so obviously Indian) that doesn't provide them with all the skills they need for their jobs.Seems you're not the only one running into this situation.. Ask to speak to their supervisor - which may or may not give you an English speaking person.  Let Yahoo and all others know how you feel about this. Tell them in more details what you have said here. . Maybe if we all complained, someone will listen <snickers> . Good luck!
on your web window go to tools, and click internet options. Delete your cookies, and clear your history. CLick apply.

I don't find it to be addictive at all..no..not me!...(twitches)It's a place where you can socialize in the world net and ask questions and earn points.  I can't get off my computer for hours lol.I guess it's similar to giving someone the chance to dribble on about themselves - people like to make themselves feel clever &/or important :)maybe its the fact we like to help others, or were sad and have note better to do at nightsBecause it's an instant gratification of having your questions answered by a wide array of people.I can quit anytime I want...I just don't want to right now...and dont tell me I'm in denial cuz ITS NOT TRUE!!!! er....I gotta answer another question now *feels withdrawls*...Personalities, variety, new ideas, humor, information, the chance to help others - I dunno, you tell me! :-))Thats because..........Sorry, your talk time has just expired......BECAUSE....?I don`t know, but it isI can give you 3 reasons:. . #1).  It's cheaper than a pack of cigarettes and a 6 pack of beer. #2).  It's legal unlike cocaine, heroine, marijuana, & L-tryptophan. #3).  It has fewer calories than light beer.I  like  getting  answers  to  most  of  my  problems  and  trying  to  help  others as  well.  I've  run  out of  questions  though.better get broadband then, work out cheaper. xxWell, once they did a survey on why people listen to Howard Stern on the radio when they are offended and wish they could stop.. . The most common answer was they just wanted to see what he had to say next...silly or not, offensive or not.. . It is like that for me on yahoo... I just want to hear what people say next?For me,it's the simplicity and ease of use of the site.
Hotmail> find the word compose/new mail.. . Yahoo> under new den mail.Find mail icon on Yahoo home page---click it---(you may have to enter your password-----do so) it will then  take you to your mail page.  Click on compose.

Go to yahoo member search and use their yahoo IDyou cannot contact himYou can contact them only if they want you to..search for their 360 page, if not, you can only email them if they let youclick on their avatar (picture), or name beside their answer and try to send them a message.  Not everybody accepts e-mail but a lot do.If the person does not allow E-mail or IM access you are outta luck I'm afraid.U have to contact the Yahoo answers or the Yahoo administrator inorder to get the ID of the person
well the best way to get rid of him is to use the block user utility found in your messenger, also it is a crime to send a computer virus on purpose so he can get a hefty fine if its proved that he sent you the virus on purpose, also try to keep a record of his/hers conversations by either saving the conversations or printing them so you have proof to show the police or court if necessary, good luck!!!!take off messenger(uninstall), and you can even call the police about it.  it is a serious crime to do that, you know...always log in as invisible ,use ur stealth settings to make ur self visible only to people u want to chat with.I recommend enabling your archive, so next time he IM's you, either you block them (hitting ignore) then or later you can go into the archive pull up that conversation hit the IM window icon in the left hand corner pull up a IM window for that person and block them or if you know his ID, you can go into preferences in the main window by hitting messenger then preferences look to the left hand column and click ignore list and put his ID in it.Do Not answer him, or report him to your website or call the local police and ask them for suggestions.
got omyspace.com and open an account there.Go to the Yahoo home page.. Click Mail. Click open an account.. Follow the dotted lines... so to speak.

Go to startup, then settings, then click on control panel. when you are in control panel got to lanquage and set your lanquage to the UK.I am with you mate (luckily ??) I had to reinstall X.P. and I caught all of the default settings and changed them to U.K. but I think one of the options in Word is to create a U.K. template for Word.go to control panel and chance the language form there.it should be options for internet and softers.on my pc, on the bottom right corner, i can choose the language i want so i don't have that problem if i do need to write in french i just change the language I need to write in and then even my keyboard become AZERTY instead than QWERTY.

Ain't the idea of having a page sharing your information with your freinds or public ? it depends on individual - U decide what U wanna display to othersI wouldn't either, but some people just don't care.  So, I guess if it makes them happy ...... -MMSocial Networking, it worked for MySpace, yahoo is trying to copy a good thing, cant say as I blame em for trying, but your right, its kinda stoopid to put your picture there. Once its uploaded, they get the Copyright of the image.Some people are more paranoid than others.  I have my 360 page open to public and will change it to private if I need to.  I post pictures I like and landscapes and cartoons.  If anyone is concerned about cyber stalking they can hide everything from the public.. Some people feel safe and are open and want to make a few friends.  I think I can protect myself from people who visit my page and I will probably change the settings soon.. . To each his own.  Dance to your own drummer.

When you see ''Accepting Answers'' on top of a question, click on the ''Answer this question'' ............ Then type what you want and preview, then submit.. errrrrrr......... I hope you are not kidding me...lol.You can click submit button to post .Um... you click the 'Answer this question' link that's below every (unresolved) question.Just click the question that you would like to answer after that type your answers and click preview and then submit.
you cant ,once it is resolved ,it is there forever,and beyond your controlYou can't remove it yourself.Yahoo wont let us delete resolved questions. They hold them for some reason.Resolved questions can't be deleted.
I agree, have you seen of the questions he asks on here......maybe we should gang up on the little pr1ck and report him........he's very childish for a 21yr old!  I have a 14yr old who is far more mature than him.Well you could fix that easily, just mark this persons email as spam and change your settings to no email.
How do you interpret trash e-mail? Do you mean Spam or something else? Just delete it!Go to your Trash Folder, and delete those . e-mails or  messages.  However messages in the trash are subject to deletion at anytime.You delete it.  It's not rocket science.
What's "wrongfully"...? . . & it is not "deleted" anyway.  If you left it untouched for 30 days... you simply won't have access to it anymore---of course no one else will either.  So your mailbox will just "lay" there "in la-la land" never to be accessed by anyone again.  Your password won't do you any good....it's been blocked.  . It's the same with Hotmail---but have you looked at the SIZE of Hotmail's allowed 'storage'.  ? it's very SMALL.   I've forgotten more than I want to know about...it's been so long.  . . These are 'web-servers' babe---not ISPs (Internet Service Providers); and webservers don't keep your storage for you to access again later. . All I'm sure of is that my IncrediMail account kept locking me out because my default-server (Hotmail) was full (IncrediMail is neither a web-server NOR is it an ISP) so I had to continue to delete everything in Hotmail to keep it below the maximum, so I'd always have access to my mail in IncrediMail (the mail would be in Hotmail---but without all the graphics.  . . So, I don't think 'wrongfully' would be a fair assessment----it's either 30 days untouched, or 30 days at maximum storage, will 'shut you out'.  . & THAT's the name of THAT tune.. . As I said to someone else..."open a new one"...and this time ----stay in touch with it.Forget it and get another one. Yahoo does not "undelete".
sometimes are by date or size. . :> peace. .I have the same problem and still cannot find a good solution.  If you don't care about using an album, then in the "All My Photos" you can click on the "Sort by:" drop-down menu and select "Sort by: Name."  If your photos are titled the way your camera produced them (e.g. DSCF301, DSCF302, etc.), this will effectively put the photos in order from oldest to newest.  You can also click the "Sort by: Reverse Sort" option to effectively change the photos to display newest to oldest.  However, the "Sort by:" option is not available in individual albums, and so for sorting photos in an album you will just need manually rearrange them.
chose Change theme ---> custom and add your background from your computer .if you have a pic (jpg format) that you want to use for a background on your harddrive-go to 360 home, "my page" there should be a few lines of text about in the middle top of page that says "Theme, edit custom theme" right next to a large ?. click on edit custom theme, where it says background image- click off single background image, then go to browse- find your pic on your harddrive, choose the pic position- tile is most common as it usually takes care of pic spacing in different browsers but you can choose what you want- then click save. or if you want to see how it looks first, click preview, then if you like it choose save

Put their email addresses in the BCC (called Blind Courtesy Copy)  field. People who receive that email will see only their address in that field and not the addresses of other recipients.. . In Yahoo! Mail, in order to display the BCC field, click the Show BCC link at the right of the To: field.When you go to your contact list you can choose to send to people as a bcc, which is a "blind contact". That person will only see their name but not others that you sent the same e-mail to.After entering one address (only) on the Addressee line, put all of the other addresses on the "BCC" line [which means "Blind Carbon Copy" in old-speak.  If the BCC line does not appear on your email window, you can opt to place it there by clicking on the link which prompts for that.You need to use BCC (Blind CC) outlook / outlook express can both do this but you may need to switch it on - off by default I think.. . HELP on outlook will guide you if you search on bcc
You need 250 points needed to get to Level 2.  So far, you've only answered 1 question, and you've asked several - each question cost 5 pts.. . At any time, you can click on "My Q&A" (upper right).  It will show you how many points you need to get to the next level (as well as some other info).  Then, if you select the blue question mark next to your points, you can view the entire point system (how points awarded, how many needed for each level, and how many q&a is allowed for each of the 7 levels).. . To gain the points, try to do the following:. - Answer as many q's as you can (limit of 20 per day at Level 1) - see above link which will tell you all the daily quotas.  2 pts each.. - Answer well (if yours is selected as best answer, you get 10 points plus 1 point for every thumbs up you get up to a max of 50). - Vote on undecided questions (Go to "Vote" column).  1 pt each.. . Also, it cost 5 points to ask a question.  (But, you can get 3 pts back if you select a "best answer" so it's a net loss of 2 pts).. . Good luck and have fun!. . http://answers.yahoo.com/info/scoring_system;_ylt=ArpdGGGizcm2YRkr3D3_kTgezKIXKeep answering questions..  Find subjects you have knowledge and interest in - it makes it a lot easier to get to your daily allotment.get addicted to this site, like me.

And asking costs you points, so don't ask anymore.
There is no way to block it - BUT if you have uploaded personal photos or personalized your page with specific uploaded stuff, then THOSE things will not be copied if someone does the "make this theme mine" thing. ONLY the font and module colors will copy.Supposing you're talking about a musical theme.... You can make a CD copy and send it to yourself by mail. Nat e-mail, real traditional mail. When it comes to you, don't open it and keep it safe. If one day somebody steals your theme, the date on the envelope that contains the CD with your theme will be all the proof you need in court.. But remember, it needs to arrive sealed and with a postal stamp on it to the hands of the judge.. Another way to be sure is to publish it. A disk that has been published is also protected from stealing.. And finally you can visit you local IFPA. You can become a member, it's very simple, and after that, you can send them anything you create and they'll keep an archive of all your themes so nobody can steal anything and get away with it.I don't get what you mean by theme.then choose a theme you don't want and then after they're done copying your theme change it to the theme you want.. . P.S. Don't be small. Who really cares?
Maybe your account has expired. Mine works just fine.No idea.. But I could not access my yahoo email yesterday.. Apparently they had problems in some geographical areas. its okay know
History stays with you. It can not be deleted. If you want to start at Zero. Ask questions until it zeros out.You can only delete open questions and answers to open questions. View your questions, hover your mouse cursor over the pencil and choose the option to delete it.  View your answer, and click the delete link underneath it.  You can continue to ask questions and loose 5 points for each one, although you did start out with 100 points.You would have to go back and delete all of your answers, which will cost you points. If you want to start back at zero, you will have to start a new Yahoo account.I don't believe there's a way to delete your history.. . The only way I know of to get back to zero is to ask enough questions to get yourself down to nothing.. . Or, just start a new account... that's the simplest way.
you can find it in your "contacts"try going to your contacts in your e-mail and get it from your address book. If you are using the new Beta switch to the classic mail first
Posting a question costs five points. This may discourage some users from asking purely frivolous questions while encouraging others to use the search or look at the similar questions that automatically pop up when asking a question.. . However, we give you 100 points to get started, and you earn three points when you select the best answer to your question. To earn more points and higher daily limits, answer other users' questions or vote on undecided questions.Everyone loses 5 points for asking questions. You can regain 3 points for choosing a best answer to your question.It costs 5 points for every question you ask.

You can't do such a thing.Study "Pop3" information on Yahoo mail.Read this.. . http://help.yahoo.com/help/us/mail/pop/pop-02.htmlYou need to have a Yahoo! Premium account to do that.. . It costs $19.99 per year.. . If you already do then go to the settings setion of your yahoo mail account and click "configure pop settings" it should be there.

you can only delete your own and only if they have not been resolved or are not in votingdelete from where?Good one:you can't.. Afraid that they see what you answered?. I'll check immediately.. Kidding,have more to do.. Think any one will check??. No way,most are to self absorbed to even read the questions,let alone to read your answers.. Don't loose any sleep over it,will you?. Greetings:Rob.xxxxI dont believe that is an option for us and up to Yahoo.  . EI dont think that's possible..If the questions have been resolved, yahoo will not let you delete. There is no possible way. For some dumb reason yahoo wants to hold them.
Fondling can't hurt.... Oh, I'm sorry I thought you asked how to get it up....sorry selective reader.Hit your avatar then Edit My Info- You will find it there. Check it and hit save.
hmmm Upgrade you're yahoo mail ^^ I did and it's so much easier, All of you're inbox mail is on one page...yes but you have to delete each [iece-at that point it ends up in the. trash.When you open your trash there is a box that says delete. all check that once or empty if it says that(hit or check empty) and all your email will disappear in one shot
Sweetie, it's "here", not "hear".HA HA  it was the AMERICANS  that  founded  this. Go start your  own  site.YOU SHOULD PROBABLY LEARN CORRECT GRAMMAR AND SPELLING FIRST, THEN WORK FROM THEREHave you tried clicking on the UK link at the bottom of the page? Or does it just bring you here? (Obviously, I haven't checked it out) Just a suggestion...... . America isn't so bad, you know - lots of us are anglophiles.This is a common complaint from UK people. At one time an angry young man even said he was going to start reporting people from the US who answered his questions. A whole bunch of us were compelled to answer him.. . I really don't think there is any way to beat Yahoo system set up, but if so someone will let you know how.
I wonder that very same thing. Edna was just plain annoying, pretty much like The What Should I Do Retard.who's edna?  Can you provide a link showing a picture and describing her?I think she ate herself to death at a SizzlersWho is Edna?You asked the question so you should know the answer. I have always viewed Edna as a part of this, both the person as the rippleeffect it created.It was funny, seeing the stoopid images of whoever that was in the pics.  The questions were weird.  Well What should I do retard is about the closest we're gonna get to Edna.. . . /doc. . Dang, Boogerman needs some help.  Where's Edna? She probably could remedy that problem.  No, no, no, Where Should I do Retard will probably be able to help better.because man..its edna dude..bkbkbkbk all day everydayy
if you write an address that starts with http:// in your answers it will be automatically transformed in a link when you post your answerGo to the website you want to recommend, highlight the address in the address bar at the top and press Ctrl and C to copy it. Then when you write your answer you can press Ctrl and V to paste it in, it will automatically come out as a link.. Hope this helps!Cut and paste the URL
there is an option that says that on my Yahoo thats how I did it.Wow, I thought I only had that problem. Someone told me my security was high on my computer.
You aren't very bright, are you?Maybe somebody flagged you 'cuz it sounds like the f-word. Lots of easily offended people around here. I'm not sure it's the best idea to change it back. You might anger the Yahoo gods.I don't know - too familiar sounding.  What is the meaning of "fuct"???  If it were my  name I would change it.You're name is "fuct". I can spell it out the correct way, but then someone would report me. I don't want a violation e-mail. . Change you're name, they might change it for you again or suspend you.. Fuct, you're stupid-funny.So glad Yahoo are 'on the ball', your nickname wasnt very pleasant sounding. no name sounds much better. Pity they couldnt delete you altogether.i presume yahoo found it offensive. not that offensive if you ask me.It's obviously discrimination because you have an avatar resembling an azn.
We can't see the questions that you deleted. You can, I guess as a reminded that you once asked it.You can delete questions that are stil open by going to it and scrolling over the pencil icon. Resolved questions and in voting questions aren't meant to be deleted but you can report them for abuse and see if you can have Yahoo remove them for you.id like to know tooHas it been resolved yet.. . If so you can't delete it.. . If not then just use the options on the message drop down menus to delete it.get your account deleted is the only wayyah...Me, three.You can not delete previous questions or answers.   Check the guidelines.If your question has been resolved, it will not let you delete it. Yahoo holds them for some reason. Weve all tried everything, it simply will not let you delete them. . . If you have a question open, then it WILL let you delete them.
Yahoo is a free service and doesn't provide that option.It depends on which mail account and software you are using.. . I don't think yahoo or hotmail provide this service.. . You do see this option with email accounts thru Outlook and Lotus Notes. So not sure if it is something with the account or the software for the mail.DID  NOT K NOW THAT OPTION WAS AVAILABLE.. . . GOD BLESS
What is the message? Are you sure it's not being deleted. Do you have a slow connection? Check your options and your connections and if that doesn't help then email support.probably only temporary as Yahoo is still working on beta mail. . E
when you get a e-mail from that sender you speak of, don't open it.. check mark the box in front of it and click spam above it.. and that will put sender on block..Hi,. Click on mail options and then on mail addresses, under management, and it will have you to fill out the simple form. . Hope this helps you.Click on "options" >> "Block addresses "and there enter the address you wish to block
Hi Ann. I'm not sure what you mean by "Trailers" but if you click on the message you're replying to, you should get a box which surrounds it.   If you then click again you should be able to highlight whatever you want to delete.   Sorry, it's all a bit difficult to describe <BG>  Are you reading your emails on your Group's site or on your own Inbox?. This new Yahoo Groups mail is a real pain, isn't it.. . LesleyI use Yahoo Groups a lot, but I don't understand your question.. . If you wish to reply to a Yahoo Groups message, reply to the Group's email address.  As long as you are a registered user to that group with that email, it will post to your group so long as your group is set to accepts posts from all members (ie not just mods).. . Hope that helps -- I have no idea what "trailers" you are referring to -- something tells me no-one else did either, thus your lack of repliesI use the traditional mail option on my Yahoo Groups, and I'm able to edit (highlight and delete, etc) all my posts, with no problems.   I remember someone saying, on one of my groups that they were using either the fully featured or the beta version and they were not able to trim their messages.. . HTH,. Ellen in Queens, NY
Yeah, Sandy is right!  The republican Christian women was tired of their husbands having something to do for hours on end and had to put a end to it.. . Yahoo even tried removing their chats from the html site and just on yahoo messenger.  I guess that still didn't work either.  A lot of married men have a messenger account with access to tons of yahoo chats.. . Wives got jealous.  The population started going down...and it goes on.The Christian Majority that owns the government decided that adults do not know how to conduct themselves in a Morally Acceptable fashion that reflects good Republican Values. Or Yahoo! got complaints from the Moral Majority.

Ctrl-H, look at history, IE, Internet Options, Delete History, Clear Cache. Same in any browser. It mightg be Tools or somesuch thing, but is History,Cache and Temporary Files and Cookiees.check the history and delete history and cookies etc.
yea check with the providerWho's your registrar?  You can't really "change" your domain name, some places will let you "change" but what they're really doing is just giving you another new domain name.  Ask the business you registered your domain name with.
go to. Tools. Internet Options. then on the small pop up. look for delete history and click . . get rid of the cookies on the same screenTools > Internet Options > Content > AutoComplete > Clear Forms. This will clear out ALL your autocompleted forms, such as search windows, form fill-ins, etc. You can also reset your Auto-Complete options here.. . Or, to delete just a single (or a few) searches, just have them highlighted in the drop-down list and hit DELETE -- they will vanish! If you hold down the key, the whole drop-down list of searches will delete.. . If you are using the Yahoo! Toolbar, I believe there is a drop-down box at the end of the search window that has the option to CLEAR SEARCHES on it.. . Clearing your history only clears out the PAGE locations that you have recently visited.You naughty, naughty person!  You've been looking at porn haven't you?  Try all you want, but if anyone is really good with computers they can figure it out even if you follow Xani's directions.  Good luck though!

stuff you normally wouldnt say or do around adults in a public setting.what it says!!  blimey!"It means you're probably too young to view it.Adult: mature person who is leagally passed the age of being a minor. In most parts of the world the general age is 18 years while some conservative countries still only consider 21 year olds as being adults.. . Content: what is contained in a package of sorts.. . Adult content: when something contains material which is meant to be experienced by adults only and not minors.It  has sex,violence and foul languageIt means the content contains sex, swearing or violence usuallyIt means either inappropriate references to sexual topics, or bad language. Why, did you get reported for it? Just don't say anything that you wouldn't say in front of your grandparents, and you'll be fine.means that adults are happy. content means happy. adult means not-young people. you get the drift

This guideline is a clear warning to paedophiles, who would attempt to "groom" youngsters toward meeting them, or seducing them into email messaging, or otherwise coerce them into looking at offensive material or photographs.. . This is a Community site for people from the age of 13 years of age and up.  Yahoo!Answers, and the Y!A community at large, has a duty of care to these minors.  It is therefore right and proper that this clause should be classed as the most serious violation contained within the Community Guidelines.It means you can't  ask minors for sex, post sexually explicit material about having sex with minors nor post pictures that are adult in mature that will upset minors. In other. words... no porn!it means it is against the rules to expose minors of abusive material such as pics or links..you see, those who do so, do not realize the YAT has established rules, rules that we all must govern by. if someone harms minors of potential abusive pics/links, he/she will suffer the consenquences.. follow the rules, and no problem..we have MANY rule breakers MsKnowItAll, a bit nauseous to think how many there are.that users are not allowed to post questions or answers in an attempt to exploit or harm our children, which includes, link, photos or adult related content.After looking up all the terms in the OED, I reached the conclusion that it could either mean that we're not allowed to conduct mining oporations for, represent in court, or damage a particular Fraciscan nun, or that we're not allowed to take advantage of, make sexual advances towards, or otherwise hurt kids.

Ellie? Who the F*uck is Ellie?i do not know her.She's threatened to kill you hasn't she? Ha Ha Ha Ha, I've got a great book on how to deter demented ex army personnel from tracking and finding you, you can borrow if you like.Maybe someone reported her for being abusiveBecause her questions may not have followed the Y!A TOS. I think some of these rules are too open to interpretation and there are people who will report questions and answers simply because they can't get with the sarcasm or humor or just simply don't agree with the opinion expressed.She wouldnt let the moderator take her up the ass....thats what i was told anywayjoin the rebellion girl...i dont know why she was banned but you might be interested in some of my questions today...lol...;0)I loved her sense of humour and she offered me sex if i wasn't Scottish which was a bonus as i'm English but now i cant take up her offer as she has been banned so if you know of any other lady that will offer me sex can you let me know xxcos some of  the sad fu(ks on here have no sense of humour.. .... hope she comes back soon those of us who enjoy a laugh will miss her..... .

Some people are sooo sad !!. . Ahh well i am sure she will be back !

actually u need to specify before asking a question.share comes under so many catageries.any way simple share means aquire a  portion of whatever it maybe like money,sorrows etcIt maybe equivalent to a number of stocks depending on how many they apportion to one share.  Sometimes one share may be equivalent to 10,000 worth of stocks  or maybe higher or lower.when you give to another.r u talking for share market or a different share...In Business like Stock Exchange...A paper that says that you have invested in a property and u are entitled to the dividends.... . Share or Sharing is when you divide what you have among certain number of people or just give it to some one else...when you give some to another person.

If they are using your account then change your password.

All you can do is choose to view your answers or Watch List instead.. .

Because many times just walking is impossible for some of these people. Stores give them the closets parking spaces out of caring. I have seen some people though that use someone elses handicapped parking tag just so they will get to park closer which is atrocious.Parking fees are mainly used as a way to cut down conjestion and lack of parking spaces.. . Disabled people park for free because they are forced to travel by car.. . Other people have a choice whether to use a car, walk or use public transport.Because life is hard enough for them,why not help where we can.. Plus they are probably unable to work as they would like and so are forced to manage on benefits.Because err. . . there disabled? lol. I don't know really it just makes life easier for them i suppose!You are supposed to prove that you have an injury or disability that restricts your movement to be able to get a disabled badge so you can park closer to amenities. I'm sure there are plenty of sad lazy sneaky little gits out there though that abuse this, same as any other system put in place to help those less fortunate than the rest of usThe answer is so obvious that you do not deserve . an explanation, excepting with regard to abuse of these. reserved spaces being taken up by those who are not. disabled, which is a disgrace and disrespect towards . the unfortunate. All users should think a little more. and hope that, some day, they do not have the misfortune. of becoming disabled themselves. PS the reply immediately . above this one, tells you from the point of view of the disabled.. So, now that he had the guts, I also admit to being disabled. by a fractured spine (L5) which cannot be mended. I take . about 20 steps and stop to recover breath and pain. The use. of a wheelchair has been suggested, but I refused since I. have to keep my back muscles active. I wear a tight corset. with steel rods on each side of my spine and another two on. each far side. Also a walking cane is mandate for balance. To . finish up, I only hope that you, who questioned us, should never. have to suffer any sort of tragedy. Thanks for understanding.don't know they just do and they get the best spots too. My dad has got a badgeMy disabled badge cost me £120 on e-bay. I use it when I go to the Gym for my runwell you don't give your age so i should guess your still at infants. school otherwise you may know that in this life nothing is free. the badges just try to compensate a little to the less fortunate and. who no longer are as fit and agile as they used to be and would love to park away from there destination then take a brisk walk. to where they want to beI don't know where you live, but in my town, we don't park free, we just get prime spots when they are available. There are often not enough.  And I guess you can think it unfair, but many of us need extra wide parking spaces in order to unload wheel chairs from special vans or to swing out lifts for wheel chairs or scooters.  I  hope you never have to find out how hard it is to have a spinal disease and have to walk from the middle of the parking lot in the rain when you walk extremely slow and can't park close to the building or can't go to the grocery at all because you just can't walk the distance.  There may be a few who abuse the permits but I assure you that most of us really need to park close to our destination or we get stuck at home.

you can you have to sign out of the other person nomeYou can sign back into your name.  You have to log the person who used your Yahoo Messenger last and refill in your name and password.  Best of luck with my advice to you.make sure you changed the sign in name and password to your own, and make sure too that you don't have it set up to remember the info each time.  you'll have to delete it then each time and put your own in.

I know what you mean.  There is a yellow star you can click on but that just lists them.  Directly to the right of the yellow star is a smaller yellow star with a green "plus" sign overlapping it.  If you click on that it will let you add favorites.It can be added on the right side of your page where the quotations are.  That's where I have my bookmarks or favorites like TV line up, and other things I want handy.

The same thing happened to me. In a few days, it will start working. And if it doesn't just contact AIM. This happens mainly because the connection is low and cant be sent.It is possible that your firewall is interfering with your outgoing messages.  You might want to check your firewall and add yahoo IM as a safe site.
Go into Yahoo Avatars and change it.When u go to your e-mail, just click on it! Good Luck!When you sign on to your email, click on the picture of your avatar. Then if you dont know what to do from there, you click on either the backround,apparel, etc tabs, then find what you want then click "add to favorites" then go to "my favorites" tab and click on what you want then click "save changes" below the full avatar pic.Go to http://avatars.yahoo.com to change it.
There is no way to tell. If you have been sending a message and never get a reply then it is a good bet that they have you on ignore.if you can not talk to them
you can't. it's secretive.They probably won't talk to you anymore. God bless!
Yes. To get through firewall do this. Messenger > Prefferences > Connection > Firewall with no proxies > Apply > Ok.Assuming you having logging problems (???) – see this:. http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20061120174024AAXBzq7&r=w#FcEqWjO.WGXCx9aTX0o1nHmcruSJJaZZ5boelertSPPyE6AuhrOT
Love is not a basic necessity of life. It is, in fact, a luxury. Therefore, I value it as much as I do other luxuries. Great to have, but could live without it!all of them!When you love somebody, you give your quality time and everything and all the best in you.TIME. to give love is to give time. That's why L-O-V-E can also be spelled as T-I-M-E.

Hi,. Yahoo mail is experiencing a glitch. I haven't found a fix for it yet In the mean-time inform Yahoo! of the problem: http://add.yahoo.com/fast/help/us/mail/c.... For those who can't get in at all try this as it seems to be working for a few.. http://myyahoo.com. Login on My Yahoo! page. Select the link at top right to go to Yahoo!'s Home Page.. Mouse over the Mail Icon under where it says (Hi, your Yahoo! id).. You should get a drop down menu with your latest emails displayed.. Select an email and click it. You then get to a new page about Shortcuts, but just select the button for Mail and it should take you to your Mail page.. It wasn't getting redirected to the shortcuts page on some servers and not going to the mail page.. I hope this helps some until Yahoo! Mail gets a fix for us.. . Yahoo! Answers customer service Toll free 1-866-562-7219 . . Yahoo, Sunnyvale, CA. 1-800-318-0608. _________________________. Try doing this:. From: Orlando. Problem understood & solved!. Message: you're right about the glitch! I closed outlook Express reopened it and the mail went out all right!. Ciao. __________________________. . I found this in What's new in mail:. We’re wrapping up a few remaining compatibility issues between Yahoo! Mail Beta and the new Microsoft Internet Explorer 7.0 Beta, and we’ll open up our Beta to their Beta towards the end of this month. Folks on the bleeding edge, please sit tight!First you don't have email at all.. Second you have an email but nobody knows it. Third you got emails, but you are looking at the long place for email.. At last you are just asking stupid questions.
what you see is blank but the recepient will see your true message.. . To forward an attachment... first you should save you attachment in your document. click the attachment buttin on your email page, browse to where you put your attachment click the attch button and when it is done click send.. easy ;)download the attachtments and then download it onto the message. hope it helps!first to properlly do it you must download attachments to your computer and then attach them to a fowarded email but sometimes however it does go through with just hitting foward I'm not totally sure but I think sometimes it depends on the actual format of the file or fowarding....but the best bet is download attachments and then reattach them to another message
You have to have a yahoo messenger and there will be a link in your profile to start a 360 page. Make sure its a new version of yahoo messengerIf you mean profile pictures, there is a section on your page, if you mean in your back ground then, you go to the edit style at the top of your page, and browse for the background pic that you want.
see the "search for Q" bar....in the "Search for questions:" thing at the top of the screen just below the "ask. answer. discover." things.
There is a setting for Windows that prompts if you want to save your password upon initial login.  After that, when you revisit the site, Windows remembers your login and opens the page directly.  To check for this, click on Tools, Internet Options, click on the Contents tab.  Click on AutoComplete button.  Here you can select whatever options your want.. . If you delete your your temp internet files and cookies, it will prompt once again for password (since passwords are save in cookies)Maybe the messenger did it before. It could be the browser you have is deleting you sign in`s. Anything new changes alot of things.If you don't sign in they will eventually drop your email and deactivate it.  You can choose not to sign in so they'll do just that, or choose to sign in so you can keep it activated.
Some one has probably turned it off. Depending on which one you have just turn it back on. Usually there is any arrow next to where it tells you that a pop-up has been blocked. Click on that and it should give you an option to turn it on.it might have cut off. You can turn it back on under internet optionsLook at the Popup Blocker Icon on the toolbar and see if it is yellow in color. If it is not Yellow the click on the down arrow next to the Icon and check "Enable Popup Blocker".that was me . u take carer of the problem on control panel.I have to go now! That isd all the info i can give at this time.Popup blockers will only stop web based popups. They can help somewhat, but if you are getting excessive popups, and popups even when you are offline, it means you have trojan downloaders on your machine that are calling out to deliver the pop up ads. . . Try a full cleaning and dis-infection routine. . . This is the one I use (it will take some time).. . 1. Scan for virus and remove (free online scan) with BitDefender. . http://www.bitdefender.com/site/home/. . 2. Scan for trojans and remove (free online scan) with Ewido. . http://www.ewido.net/en/. . 3. Scan for ad/spyware and remove (free download) with Spybot Search & Destroy. . http://www.safer-networking.org/en/spybotsd/index.html. . . If you are using an older version of Windows (pre XP-SP2) you may also be getting "Messenger Service" popups which are caused by Microsoft leaving the almost never used Windows Messenger Service enabled by default. This was corrected in Windows XP- Service Pack 2.. . Understand that the Windows Messenger Service is completely different from, and not in any way related to, "MSN Messenger", "Windows Live Messenger" "yahoo Messenger", or any other well-known instant messaging system. Therefore, disabling the Windows Messenger service will have no effect upon your use of any other instant messaging applications. They will continue to work without trouble. .  . . To disable this service in older versions of Windows use the free, Shoot The Messenger from:. http://www.grc.com/stm/ShootTheMessenger.htm. . Good luck.
All you need to do is contact the company and let them know. They might want to see a death certificate to be sure... you know?Contact the manager of the co. he used to set up that web site. Ask if you send in either an original obit (not a copy) or a copy (with the embossed seal) of the Death Certificate, will that do, and in the meantime can they suspend the web page. Stress that you are a grieving widow & really need their assistance to resolve this ASAP. My condolences to you at this time of loss. . Hang on tight, it does start getting better.You might also ask someone to compose a farewell note of explanation & post it to that site so that users will know what is happening & maybe have a chance to express thier condolences.
idk but it sounds fun and the way u put it, it sounded funnyThere`s something in software ot there to do it. But Yahoo is supported by ads so that we get the free services.
Turn your speakers down :)If it is part of your toolbar, you should be able to go to it and take the check off for playing a sound. If not that, go to tools and then pop up blocker and then settings and one of the boxes talks about sound- uncheck the box and that should work.. Hope it does!!!
Outlook Express?. If you have already installed the icons, you have to reboot your pc then you'll see the icon box on your IE.  . But be informed that such programs got adwares.It may just be that you're spelling it wrong.. . "Outlook Express"
If you select Messenger, Preferences, Ignore List, you can see who you've selected to ignore and you can remove the id from the ignore list by clicking on the id and then clicking the "Remove" button.

Click On The Name..When Window Opens  .. Click On ADD..IF The Person IS On Your Ignore List.. It Will  SHOW and You Will Be Able To  Remove Them From "IGNORE LIST " Hope This is Helpfull..GD>Luck.
That is probably considered "chatting", which is against the Community Guidelines. You might want to check them out at:. . http://answers.yahoo.com/info/community_guidelines.php. . so you know what is a good question. There are "chat" sites for chatting -- this is not supposed to be used for that -- sorry! Hope you find some other fun questions to ask instead.Its some jerk doing it to you. The sad thing is....yahoo is letting them do it. Its not fair. I just wouldnt post a question for a little bit. Try again later, and see what happens. . . Sorry youre dealing with that. I know the feeling.May be your shoes pic having a big file size.Either the image contains  virus or  worms  OR it's a right protected image-which you cannot use for display without the permission from the respected company.If you are able to load your own picture than why not? your boot;Don't get mad !Your boot  is so cute,per perhaps  yahoo is thinking some one will steal it. Who delete your pix.Re size the pic and load it again.Because it is considered Chatting and this is a Q&A site.  There are plenty of Chat rooms, Messengers, email etc. to choose from.Maybe they don't allow pics? Try adding a link to a page that has a pic of them. Also answers has been having a lot of wierd glitches lately, I think it is the amount of people joining and they are trying to update to keep up. You can always ask answers...I think you look under the side tab list on the left...I believe it is the last choice, or try the help tab at the top right part of your screen.. . Maybe rephrase the question...like a philisophical fashion question..like "what impression does this picture convey to you? Explain what the picture makes you think of?" (therefor it is not chatting)...then see how many positive responses and look for advice there.. . Good Luck.
sounds like you've cut and pasted the url code instead of the embed code. at the side of the video clip there are these two options cut and paste the embed code click html then in your blog space right click and choose paste then it should play.. if you want to centre your clip click behind it and push it with the spacebar to html if find this centres it nicely when postedtry writing a line of text above the embed ed link, i think that's how i did itYou do have to add some regular text to the blog as well. From what I can see that's the only thing you're missing.Its easy. You choose the video you want, copy the section that says "embed", start your blog, remember you have to have text in with the video screen!, write a title, or some text, paste the embedded piece and click on the view html box on the bottom...voila!1) Copy the "Emblem" HTML code (on right side of video). . 2) Go to "My Blog" in Y!360. . 3) Click "Compose Blog Entry". . 4) Place checkmark in box "View HTML Source" (important!). . 5) Paste in the coding. . 6) Add text to your blog entry (important also). . 7) After done click "Preview" and do a lookover.. 8) Finally click "Post This Entry".
Answers is glitching worse every day.Maybe it was too long.Possibly a glitch with the system. Try another question and see if the same thing happens
put their address in the bcc sectionYou have to put the email addresses in the field Bcc (Blind Carbon copy) instead of the fields To or Cc.. If you don't see the field Bcc look in the options of your program to enable it. :)Create a 'group' with the contacts.  E-mail to your group name.  The recipients will only be able to see your group name.
after you sign into yahoo messenger and it comes up. in the top left corner of messenger, click messenger. go down to my status and click appear online to everyone and your status will go from offline to onlinetry signing in
Go into preferences and make things the way you want them. It's pretty intuitive.Go into Messenger right click on the “Yahoo Messenger” and then choose preferences. Then go to sounds and alerts! There should be a check on the enabling sounds
"Blog" is short for "weblog".  It's a personal space on the internet that a person frequently visits and updates.  They can post pictures, thoughts, links, quizes, polls, etc.  It's usually hosted by a webhosting company like Yahoo or Blogger.A weblog is usually defined as a personal or noncommercial web site that uses a dated log format (usually with the most recent addition at the top of the page) and contains links to other web sites along with commentary about those sites. A weblog is updated frequently and sometimes groups links by specific subjects, such as politics, news, pop culture, or computer issues.Blog is short form of Web Log.  It is a kind of online diary, where  you can post your any information and share with others.. . Like Yahoo! 360 provide space for it.A blog is actually a web logg........it's like a diary of a persons personal thoughts/links one  of the most famous blogs was " Salam Pax "  or  "Where is Raed?" or The Baghdad Blogger" a political blog from someone who was in Iraq as the war was breaking out .anyone can keep a blogg.......it;s like a cyber "Dear Diary"its a web log. that is, a site to go to when you want to have discussions about various topics such as a political blog, a car blog, a what do you know blog. it is mainly a way of getting to meet different people without having to meet them in person. or in a chat room. they come and go as they like.a blog is clog in your p.c.
I feel we should be able to chatt on here.. It may be against the rules.  . Who knows, they could have some match . for some of us.It is stupid, so people who report are the same ones who were tattletales in school that nobody liked.Nope, youre not wrong. I agree with everything you said. People are just way too sensitive.  . . Thumbs UP.no point whatsoeverChatting is against the rules here to save the site for legitimate questions and answers seeking real information. Chat groups, forums, blogs, etc. are all made available by Yahoo and many other groups to indulge that aspect. This site has a specific purpose and "chatting" is not it.. . Having said that, let me clarify that I think it to be probably the LEAST offensive thing to do here, and reporting someone for a simple clarification or comment does seem excessive. But then, there are people who will do that, to feel powerful <sigh!>. Sorry!If they want us to stop chatting, then they need to make it impossible for us to add details or edit. Of course, that would be defeating the purpose of this forum.you see, we are merely participants on this site..we do not enforce or create rules. the answers staff are the sole proprietors here..its their rules we must follow..it would be cool, if we ran answers...then agan, nah! LOL
If you are the main account holder for BT go to your account and then create a sub account for your mum.. . If you do not already have a BT email I 'm sorry I do not know.. You could just sign her up for another one like Yahoo, Gmail, Hotmail etc.go to yahoo, go to your mail, go to sub accounts, and put her details in, it will create her email address for her.....hope you grasped that, i am useless at explaining things.Just go to Yahoo Mail and set one up there.. But don't give your moms real name when filling out the information. Make something up.1. mail.yahoo.com. 2. follow the directions to setup an email accountclick on the ad and it'll show you how-it's free, too! you can switch back and forth whenever you feel like it. to go back to yahoo beta you just click on the ad again.use yahoo's free e-mail accounts...................  is there anything better?
You can't, if it's suspended you can't get into it at allType: control^SOL. If that doesn't work, jump in your time machine and skip the indiscretion.. If you use google desktop, you might be able to retrieve them if you know the keywords to search on, otherwise I'm sorry to say that I don't think you can retrieve them.You cannot do it.   You have violated the their "terms of service"  (TOS).   Start a new account.   Unless you PERSONALLY know someone that works for your email proveder....they might sneak around for you.
on google or yahoo just highlight the item then press deleteWhat did you do that you want to erase from the computers memory????
firstly do u have hide inactive icons in ur start bar, u check that right click on the start bar >> properties >> then u can see at the bottom hide inactive icons check to see if it has been turned on! If it hassent been turned on leave it then press Ctrl+Alt+del together u will see a task manager pop up, now click on the processes tab, u will see all that is running, now what to do is search for any yahoo protocols(im sorry i dont have yahoo but i have msn, thay have to be functioning to be seen) for msn messenger it shows msnmsgr.exe similarly check to search for any yahoo programs running, if u see one u kno that ur software is still on.. . hope that helps. good question!It is just something that happens. Could be your computer, or yahoo itself. Nothing to worry about.Because when you exit it exits everything
You can do that after you click forward! In other words you cannot delete addresses from the mail you received but only after you click forward to send it to some one else. Then you can highlight it and hit delete or enter.Just ignore it.
Go to your 360 "My Page" then click on "Edit Contact Details" then to "Basic Info". Select the second option under "Yahoo! Identity Display" and save then your profile will be your 360.Mine comes up as my main profile and I didn't select anything to make it do that. On my profile it simply has this ID as my main one so I guess it just defaulted to my 360 page.
Hit the Spam button. Then they won`t be back.hi. depending on your email there must be a folder call junk mail or spam and click his email and send it to spam he will be block
I seriously dont think its Yahoo doing it. I mean they ARE removing it and taking our points, BUT the real reason they are being removed is becuz some jerk is out there reporting ppl for their entertainment. Just to be mean, while thinking they are being funny. . . Its gotten rediculous, and Yahoo needs to fix this out of control problem. First thing they need to do is start reading these reports. That would be help. . . Yes, Ive had things removed that were NOT offensive and completely innocent as well. Its very unfair. I agree with everything you said here.if they delete something, you have to second guess because they will just tell you that you violated the yahoo community guidelines without mentioning which one.  i hope that yahoo should be more specific and tell us why and not just a very broad notice of violation.the workers are outsourced to 3rd world countries and do not understand them.YES, I HAVE HAD 3 QUESTIONS DELETED FROM YAHOO QUESTIONS. WHATS UP WITH THAT..Check this out:  I asked who invented the system we use to measure time.... this question was removed for "chatting and personal comunications".... aha... and I saw like 5 min. ago, somebody asked "how old are you", and this question is still there..... . i have come to the realization, that this site is full of bulls h i t ...Ok, well it could have been a perfectly good question, but yahoo may keep track of his/her history of phony questions for easy points. Now, Yahoo is eliminating OPINION questions, like "what do you think...." b/c people can earn points and arguments and such. It has to be a validate question with "HOW do you do this...?" etc....This question may also be removed b/c of suspicion of earny points easily. But yahoo keeps track of phony questioners, so if you're not one of them, don't worry!Personally, no, but I've been hearing a lot of questions have been deleted with no warning for some weird reason.i think they just have a program set up so that all someone has to do is report you and it automatically sends you a notice and deletes your stuff.  so any troll can go around just reporting stuff
Go to Start Menu, click on control panel, click on add/remove programs, find the file that contains the toolbar that you want to delete, and click delete.I presume you are asking about a Toolbar in Internet Explorer or another such internet browser. To remove one, simply right-click on the toolbar, then unselect it.Right click the toolbar and unselect it. If that doesn't work, run "Hijack This!", and remove it from your directory.sell it on ebaySimply making it unviewable from your computer won't work. You'll have to go find it in add/remove programs and uninstall it from your hard drive.Click on Start----- Settings------ Control Panel----Add/Delete programs, locate it on the llist and delete!!
don't knowit will say that if you have other mail that you have opened but have not deleted or saved.this happens often don't worry. you must have alot of pages so you need to check each one until you see the unread message. this happens i think because of the date of the email or something with the email. hope this helps
I need to get a private email.. Donald D Porter of Batavia, Ilsearch the internet for his name and/or his phone number, if calling him on the phone doesn't work.

If you are referring to Yahoo messages I have bad news for you. Yahoo messages are not stored on your computer but on Yahoo servers. Once you close the box your messages and offline messages are gone forever.i do not know
I don't have that program, but maybe you can try looking above the "address" bar, and look for a clock wrapped in a green arrow... I don't think that was much help, but I tried...On your browser- click tools- from the drop down list-click Internet option- from the new dialog box-click general tab-click browsing history tab-click setting-you can see all your history-if you like to clear it click-clear history.And wait until it's clear the history-click OK.
Go to control panel and then clear your history.  You can set it also to clear ever few days.Do an Explorer History & Cookies cleanser: Tools > Options > Clear history
There are a couple reasons.  Does this chatroom run on something like Java, and do you have it installed?  Do you have a pop up blocker?  Etc.Have you gave Yahoo age below 18? (below 18 users are banned from chat). Are you trying to eneter room which doesn’t exist (rooms sometimes errorusly shows on list even after they ceased to exist)? . Beside see this:. http://geocities.com/alqa_21/textban.htmlYou are not able to enter which chat room?
It's to encourage you to get into the habit of doing some research, and giving good answers. If you get a few Best Anawers, your points will go up very fast, and then you will be able to answer more questions.because yahoo knows alot of beginners just give stupid answers and questions so they wait until beginners get the point of yahoo answersBecause it encourages participation for you to get to higher levels.I dont kno but i agree with ya I think it stupid that we have daily limits.
try to re-boot I guess.if you don't want to received  messages from a certain individual...just hit the ignore sign in your messenger....!!!
http://www.oeupdates.com/cancel-yahoo-email-account.html go here..Pretty much just cancel your yahoo accountYou must go to yahoo deletion page and read some conditions. click this
Hehe it's funny seeing a male silhouette next to the pregnant question. Yahoo changed the default avatars from the smiley faces to the silhouettes two nights ago. I preferred the smilies!I prefer the non-gender smiley face. I'm not able to download the updated Macromedia Flash Player on this computer because this is my work computer... So that means I cannot get a new Avatar and I'm stuck looking like a man for the time being...Last I checked I was a female!Although many people seem to be taking it as a male avatar, we were going for a silhouette that's gender neutral. As just a default, though, it's a light grey and won't usually draw much attention to itself.. . To give a Yahoo! profile a little more personality, users can opt to use a Yahoo! Avatar or a picture from Yahoo! 360. To do this, go to the My Q&A page and click Edit My Info. Select the option you'd like to use in the Picture section, and be sure to save the changes.They've changed the default non Yahoo 350 account from a smiley face to a silhouette.I think they put their pic as a Yahoo! 360 thingy
You can save it out to your computer by doing File > SaveAs. You may want to go to the "printable" version of the email first, so you don't get a lot of extraneous headers and such with it. Hope that helps!Forward a copy to yourself. Then you can put each one in 2 seperate folders.
have you looked in your Q&A's?. it's up there on the right in green. look up and you'll find itclick on your avatar...when the page opens, scroll down and there will be three tabs; one is 'my answers' and one is 'my questions' and one is 'my watchlist'.  Click on 'my questions' and scroll down to the question you are concerned about and click on it....there will be the page with your question and all the answers that other people posted.  If some answers are not there, then either someone reported that answer as a violation and yahoo deleted it or the answerer themselves went back and deleted it.If I may help the answer is in your question and only you have the key, more information required.omdMy Q&A in the top right cornerClick the My Q&A link. . Scroll down the page. . Click the My Questions tab.. Click the link to view the question.. Scroll down to view the answers.
Yes you can have minus points.... but then you go down to Level 0. . I saw someone with -25 points once... forgot the username though.. Level 0 people can only ask one question per day and only answer like five or ten questions daily.I think if you run out of points, you will not be allowed to ask another question.You just wouldn't be permitted to ask anything else until you earned some more points.im not actually too sure about this one lol but i think it seems possible thoughno you'll not get expelled from yahoo. yahoo provides unlimited amount of questions.Cosmic Charlie's answer gets my vote for top answer!Yes you can have negative points, I've seen it before. I don't think you'd be expelled from Y!A - because even though you don't pick any best answers, your questions are still going to voting, which allows other users to vote for a best answer, and they get one point for voting. Also, the best answer gets 10 points still!. And as others above me have already stated, if you have no points, you're going to be extremely limited in the number of questions you can even ask per day - it might be one or none even!That's a good question to which I'm not sure of the answer.  I don't do it because I don't want to lose the points, but I think I might check into it, as you've asked.that would be silly. if you think about it, if you get good answers, answers that you are satisfied with then you would choose one, would you not? if your answer sint good enough, you cant surely expect a good answer? what do you think?like be in debt to yahoo for points ?   that's funny! probably once you get that low and totally run out ,,the choice would be yours to either start answering real quick to bring them back up or just say bye-bye.....You can have minus points, but you can't ask any questionsYou end up having no points and you aren't able to ask anymore.they get shot them in the head from point blank rangeanswering questions is the best way to earn points,so it does not matter if you ask and never award a best answer.You can have minus points,but i doubt if you would be evicted from Yahoo.They love us to bits!goes intovoting and i think its about 3 points. check out yahoo blog page will have it on there.No, you just get cut off.
it means that the person's computer hasn't had any activity for about 15 minutes.  they may still be at the desk, but are watching tv and not actively mousing or typing.  or messenger is open and the computer is on, but they are away from the desk.yeah its what the person above said. basically someone still logged on but didnt put an away message up. and there hasnt been any movement on the computer for like 15-20 mins the users can set there idle times. usually they are gone away from the comp but forgot an away message.
I'm having the same problem!!!! Help!!!! lol.  Good luck...hope we can get an answer on this.i don't knowI think you are already sighned in or you are not typing the correct login details.

Well, after the question has expired, it is put up for voting. Friends of the answerer may come along and try to vote for their friends. To make it fair, they take off the names and avatar until the best answer has been picked.They  list it this way when the question is 'in voting' so that you will be choosing the answer to vote for based on the answer itself and not on the user who wrote it. It is only like this for questions that are 'in voting'.because its voting time.its a confidentiality thing
go to internet exployer, bring up yahoo if thats your carrier then hit mail and put in your passwordlog on and bring up what you are looking for.All you have to do is get on a computer that's connected to the Internet, and if you have Yahoo!, go to www.yahoo.com. Click the button "My Yahoo!" or "Yahoo! Mail."Who is your email provider?  Most providers have a 'webmail' interface that will allow you to read your email using a website.  You should go to your email providers website and look for links to their webmail system.If your mail is done with yahoo or aol just type in (the one it is).com ex..yahoo.com.. it will come up click on check mail and sign in

Your preferences may have gotten changed somehow...Do not ask me how but sometimes it will happen just recheck it and you should be fine...if that does not work then maybe yahoo is just having a "moment" reboot and try it again!!yeah, i have the same problem now wasn't that way a month ago also they have the Cc  added where before it wasn't unless u used it. i knw, now u have to type it all out or just use the address insert.If the address is in your contact list and you have auto complete going on, it should.If you don't have it in your contacts, it won't pop up no matter how hard you try.You have to add the person's email address in your contacts and pick a nickname for that person.  When you compose your message, type in that nickname and that should do it.

You're not special enough.It's probebly because your computer is too old. Or your system. Do you have windows XP? that should work.
You forgot to mention stupidity, illiteracy, insipid questions, immaturity, and lazy people who can't do their own homework. You're entirely justified in your reactions. If the questions here represent a cross section of (mostly) American intelligence, then America is in big trouble.Letting yourself get sucked into a negative mindset, I see. That's your choice. Almost everything in the world these days contributes to a negative mindset. It will drive you crazy. Again, that's your choice to let it.Don't sweat the small stuff Heather.. Choose your battles wisely or you will go insane!I do it too, in my arena it is liberals vs. conservatives, or christians vs everything else...... i geuss its no different that any other group except we get to hide behind a pretty little cartoon....I know what you mean.  I responded to some teen's attempt at cheating at their homework ("no thanks sweetie" I posted. "Do your own homework".), and received a violation.  I guess that's what happens though, because we'd want the "Not a question or answer" reason to exist if someone said anything rude or ignorant.  . So I guess the rules will and can be abused sometimes, but in spite of that, for the good of the community (website & forum) they are needed.

You need a credit card? What service are you using? Yahoo! doesn't make you do that, neither does Hotmail or GMail to my knowledge. Unless you are looking for an ISP e-mail address, but I don't know. Can you give a bit more information?It's just for security purposes, to make sure that you are the responsible adult registering for your child.  I had to provide a credit card as well, but nothing is charged to it.
in your toolbar, find a blanke place and right click and customize or add and remove icons/commands this will give you the option to add most things... :)You have to be talking about IE 7   because there is nothing like that in Yahoo Toolbar. Click on Tools > Menu Bar > Put a checkmark beside it.

o mon i totally know what you're talkin bout. i think its because you all of the changes they're making thats causing delays. it seems that maybe they are making it better maybe we should just sit and wait. things may turn out better then it looks now.It is called going from Bad to Worst! Never hasYahoo created a Program which works correctly! The Botton Line is they are simply to "CHEAP" to hire competent people.my answer to this question would be a yes.. lately, i noticed that yahoo's mail doesn't work sometimes, their messenger also doesn't work, and when it does, it messes up my computer. i heared that there was a problem with their game server a little while ago. yahoo's chat is getting so much worse with all those bots that yahoo doesn't do anything about. and yahoo has removed their "user rooms". yahoo has got to fix all those things. i feel that yahoo is not caring so much.. i don't why i feel that way but that's how i see it.so i really hope yahoo improves themselves.I'm not "drumming" for Yahoo!--I'm neutral for obvious reasons. If you're having the type of problems you describe, talk to or email Yahoo! tech support first. If, except for this, you've had good luck with them over-all, don't give up on them. Every internet provider has their problems.
What's it doing when you try?  There's probably many possible reasons.Wat is the exact error you are getting?

You my dear are in the twilight zone do not attempt to adjust your computer for the next 24 hours we will control the horizontal and the vertical.Sometimes when you are the first person to answer that would appear on the second page nothing will show up until at least a day later or when another person answers to get at least 2 people to appear on page 2... this has happened to me but it appeared later.... . One time I looked at a "closed" question for the answers and I could not see the last answer since it was the last one and the only one on page 2...Was your answer on page 2 of the answers?There may be some glitchs today. Itll eventually show up. I keep getting 10 points for best answers, but Im not getting the email notifications. So, something up with the site.It happens all the time to me...especially after giving a long detailed answer...and it doesn't show up...it is because of timing...Yahoo is closng down the "open" question for Voting is all I can surmise.THere are some questions that have more than one page.  So look at the bottom by the last answer and you will see how many pages then click the last page on you will find your answerThats a mistake..it will be ok in the moment!Maybe someone has you on "automatic violation" status where everything you ever post, ever, will automatically be reported as a violation.  Or has to be screened before being permitted to show.. . Just kidding but it seems like they're reporting folks for frivolous alleged "violations." . . Maybe yahoo's just having trouble keeping up? Go check and see if your answer is there now.Gee, I never thought to go check that my answer was showing... or even to check if I truly got the 2 points!! Now I'm scared!! If there are any good-looking single heterosexual guys out there, I need one of you to hold me!!

You should better by a microphone.. It's better than microphone on camera and it's better to hear.. . Try to update your drivers of your camera.yeah, that is because by definition cameras do not transmit sound.. . you need a mic or software that can access the mic and the camera at the same time.  Yahoo messenger doesn't do this by default.  You can tun on a web cam and then turn on voice chat separately though.
Dial Up that's why. Or you have lots of viruses that are slowing your computer.You could consider uninstall your current Yahoo! Messenger and download from http://www.filehippo.com/download_yahoo_messenger/.  The latest version is Yahoo! Messenger 8.1.0.195.  You could also find a list of previous versions of Yahoo! Messenger on the right panel.try downloading it again, maybe its just an error.
Go to your email account. Go into contacts then delete it from there. No point in closing down your account as when you try to set up a new one, assuming you use the same server the old account will still be there and they will hold all the old information still so when you go to re-enter this information it will stop you and say there is already a user with that name.just close the account
You might just be extremely popular.

I can only think of trying to adjust your font size.  For example, in IE6, choose View, Text Size, then select Largest.If you mean the letter size on web pages try holding down CTRL and moving your mouse wheel this makes the letter size larger and smaller
Stating someone's name directly in the question, basically aiming the question to one or a few small select group of people. Large genres like ethnicities are a different story, but people may report that for being racially discriminative if they feel it was out of bad taste to ask it. So use each of those specifics with caution.Asking a question which encourages others to participate in a conversation with you, 'what are you having for dinner?' 'what should I wear tomorrow?' questions that invite others to 'talk' with you rather than offer an answer to a question..  Asking if anyone wants to IM you, or wants to chat with you, all of these are seen as a violation of the no chatting and personal communications guideline

Find a website that you like, go to the tools menu, click internet options and click on "use current" and you'll have a brand new web page.(L_)Delete all the crap it installs when you get yahoo. Like toolbars, pop up blockers etc. I think you should try re-installing yahoo and when it asks you what you want to install unclick everything that you dont use.You can right click on the Yahool toolbar until a box opens and place a check next to what you dont want.  Or if you dont want Yahoo toolbar at all you can go to control panel.. Add or remove programs... and remove it all together.  . E
sign in to yahoo and search for my account link ,in the page that is displayed you can change id.....i suppose.try it if you can do it inform me...Die and be re-born again. Hopefully you could acquire your favorite body.Contact the tech support of your internet provider. The info. and change can sometimes "click" between user and provider faster.
This question has come up before.. . The consensus seems to be that you can only delete your question when it is "open".. . When it has become resolved, or closed to answers, you cannot delete the question.. . If you don't mind losing points, you could try asking someone else to  report your question as a violation.  Then Yahoo might remove it, but you'd lose ten points.You can't i'm afraid. Once on they are there to stay.Onyl questions still open to answers may be deleted! . . Clicking on your 'username'. Select "questions" on the tabs. Click on the question you want to delete. Under you actual question is a bar with a pencil butt on the extreme right of the bar. Hover over the pencil to get a drop down menu. . . Choose the bottom option "delete". . Bingo. . Question is gone!. . Your ONLY question shows up as "In voting"! . I reckon Yahoo has nicked it for all time??sorry, i dont think you can delete questions once theyve been resolved.good 1 . i was wondering that alsoYou can only delete your question if it hasn't been resolved. If it has then forget about it. Otherwise, put your cursor over the pencil icon on the toolbar under your question. And a list will come down w/options to edit your question. Go a few down and you'll have the option to delete your question. Hope that helped mate! Cheers!sorry you cant delete them

From Yahoo Help:. . What if my question doesn’t receive any answers?. . Questions have a 4-day open period. If your question doesn’t receive any answers within this time frame, it will expire and be deleted. However, before the question expires, you have the option to extend the open period to 8 days.. . To do this, go to the question, click Edit (pencil icon) in the action bar below the question, and select Extend Expiration.. . If nobody answers your question after 8 days, you can ask your question again or search Yahoo! Answers to see if someone else received an answer to a similar question.The action bar is beneath your question. It's where you see how many thumbs up and thumbs down your question has received, others can flag your question, you can mail your question to someone, and a pencil icon. Hover your mouse cursor over the pencil and click the option "Extend expiration".
email them and ask them for the info you requireWhen you exchange email the name of the person will usually be seen when and if they return an email to you.  There are sites that you can look up people like that but I believe that you have to pay.  If they have a Yahoo address you can try Yahoo people search and see if that tells you anything
The problem is on Yahoo's end. Mine has been down since yesterday. I removed and reinstalled it, changed the password, and did everything else suggested to me. There are a lot of people posting questions about this. I guess we all just have to wait until Yahoo fixes whatever their problem is.I'm having the same problem: can't get into it. I guess we all have to be patient.You are not the only one having problems. You should see how many people are having trouble including me. I even uninstalled the software and reinstalled it and it hasn't work. My has been down since yesterday afternoon and that is what time it looks like others had their problems.
go to the yahoo toolbar homepage!DONT DO IT . I DID AND IT GAVE ME A VIRUSSS.

they stole ten points from me.  i am not amused.Some one was offended for some reason, and reported you,, but don't fret over it,, it takes all kinds on here.There is no accountability on this site. Anyone can flag anyone else for no good reason, and there are no appearant ramifications, and no questions asked (No pun intended).  You are not even allowed to know who flagged you......... It is very irritating..................it's amazing what is ok and what's not with this place. ever visited the religion and spirituality section? it's as bad as it gets. i'm not offended by it, but still.. . they made some changes to the way questions get deleted. it's more automated now i think. you can read about it in the yahoo! answers team 360 page. but there needs to be a big overhaul i think. someone can ask things in religion and spirituality that are way over the line and get away with it. but, with any other topic, they're afraid that one person on the other end of the earth might get a little upset.Someone obviously reported you just to get a kick. It has happened to me to. It's not fair, yahoo needs to do something about this!!!!yahoo is a big program they make mistakes every now and thenI keep askin questions and they keep denyin me. So dont feel bad your not the only on. Gueuss answers doesnt like us. Heres a hug. HUUUUUUUUUUUUUGI have been hammerd by the censurs also.  They are not very forgiving are they?  By the way I have two Great Danes that sleep on the bed with me and my wife.  Sorry I missed your posting.Most likely, just someone surfing thru the questions and answers saw it, reported it, and ran. Its happening to alot of ppl here. Its very unfair, cuz it goes to yahoo, they take 10 or more of our points and thats that. . . Its rediculous how it can happen and so many are leaving due to this on going problem. Yahoo needs to fix it, before their site caves. I love it here, but they have a problem with this.. . Sorry youre dealing with it too. Alot of us here know the feeling. . . Try not to let it discourage you.Same thing happened to me, its the format that you must use, sometimes it automatically deletes your content. Check the Community Guidelines.

Keep this between the two of us, OK?. . No one has ever complained about Yahoo and lived to tell about it.hard to complain about something that is free.  . .

When adding addresses to your e-mail, check the "bcc" box next to the names of who you want to send the mail to.  Just make sure to put at least one the addresses in the "to" box.. . To block address on fowarded mail, I always go the the "reply" option and highlight and delete everything I don't want to foward.  Then I "bcc" all the addresses.Yup just put adresses in the BCC box. Ususally you have to put one address in the 'to' box and most people put their own address.
you can't, that's ridiculous.  if you feel someone has offered you an answer good enough to be chosen as best then they deserve the reward of the points.  of course you can't give the points to someone else.

I would actually use WinZip to zip the file instead of converting it to a PDF.  You can download WinZip if your computer doesn't already have it.  Just Google it and it'll lead you to the website.  WinZip shrinks large files and allows them to be easily emailed and whatnot and since PDF's are really hard to adapt and change if someone doesn't have Adobe, keeping the file in the Word format is a lot easier in the long run.If you have the full blown Acrobat, you can reduce the file size under File, reduce file size.. . If not, you  may have to make low resolution cts (photos) to place into your word document so the file size is smaller to begin with.Have you tried Adobe Acrobat reader??

It probably depends on how the Webpages are designed, and the size of them. My understanding is that resolved questions are kept online for access "forever", meaning that possibly there isn't a server issue. I understand where you are coming from; I'd hate to look through the thousands of my answers for one particular answer, so I usually just use the search bar instead.mintee 1+1=2 dont worry about things that you will never understandMy guess is that sooner or later they will. There is no possible way that they can stay on so long.
I don't know. I can't get into messenger eitherbecause the messenger you are using doesnot work any more and you need to update. or your connection to the internet is not working.

Norton is a nightmare! You can probably right-click once on the icon and click 'disable'. I end up removing Norton completely off my computer, but had to go into the registry and deleting it there in order to get it off. Good luck.It is on the server. You can still do both. I do.

On some browsers, if you hit the browser back button after you have submitted a form, like a post on yahoo, it will resend what you have wrote.   . . If that's the case, then don't hit the browser back button and click on the home-page or something.It is either a Yahoo! glitch which sometimes does happen with the group posts or you might be hitting the send button twice. I would put my money on the first one.
thats a load of bullbecause bulls are very aggressive and you wouldn't wanna offend them by leaving them out !!! i think we should lobby for a toad wrestling section however coz i wouldn't want the slimy gits on my door asking why they were left out  xxMaybe for the members who live in countries that have Bull fighting!i am sure its there as some sickos enjoy this barbaric sport.Are you serious? there is a bull fighting category?>meep!what a good question,as I've wondered about this too,as it a barbaric thing to do,so why is there this category? I will just have to find out this now,so will try asking yahoo and see what they come up with!!!If you are referring to the category in UK answers, then it basically means a category where people can put questions that can't be categorised elsewhere.  At least that's the official meaning I've seen.  The UK has no bull fighting arenas, I live there and I would know about it.  Why it's called bull fighting I have no idea, it seems ridiculous to me, but there it is.  it isn't advocating bull fighting.here,here...well said!

Open your briefcase and right click on the file you want to send.  Then arrow down to the e-mail option.Or, if by briefcase, you are referring to the physical object, then you would have to scan the file into your computer. You would first need to open a new folder using that file name as the name of the folder. When you open up your email to send to the recipient, you would attach that file to the email and then send it.i dont really know.. u can try copying and pasting it. thats what u do sometimes.like if its lieterally ot of ur briefcase than scan it ontot the computer and then there should be an attach button when u compose the email and then browse through the file that u saved the document in.. . if ur getting it out of the computer file, "briefcase" than press the attach or send attachment button when composing the email and then browse through the "briefcase" file and then double click on the document ur trying to send and then press ok. and wait for it too attach and then send whatever document that u have to send in the email..?. . best of luck to you. . . cara_nicole.?
ummmm... i willl come back to this question later because i dont understand the question add a detail and re ask the question. thanks have a nice weekend . . P.S. ANSWER BACK IN 10-20 MINUTESWait until Yahoo updates it messenger program. The latest Messenger has tons of problems and this in one of them - it doesn't recognize your friends off the messenger list.Roses are red, violets are blue.  If it wasn't for Christmas, we'd all be Jews.
So, at worst, we are looking at someone who has created a separate profile specifically to feed their main profile "Best Answers". . . I don't think you can report a user, specifically.  You report questions that violate Yahoo's policy.. . I don't think that there is any policy banning this kind of intentional "Answer-Feeding" (I don't know what else to call it).   Since the points have no value beyond "bragging rights", Yahoo will probably not really do much about anyone trying to skew te system.. . Plus, if you look at Christie's progress so far, cheating is not really helping her too much.  She is only at 16% after 6-7 months, she is only level 3 (I got there after 2-3 months).  I am not sure if fattybobatty can post any questions if she goes negative with her points so she will probably bottom out before Christie can make any headway on the "Best Answers". . . I would just let it goi dont understand what you are complaining aboutUp in the right corner, there is a "help" link. Make a ticket and include your link, or the link to this question.JUST LIVE WITH IT WHY REPORT ANYONE  THERE IS TO MANY OF IT HEREhonestley even politicians vote for themselves so they allow it.If you really want to report the person go to abuse and then it gives options pick one and report.Just to let you know they won't do anything you might get the same answer i gave.Someone i know has alreadt tried to report and nothing happened.
The highest authority can be found at Yahoo HQ located next to Mathilda Avenue in Sunnyvale, California. You can’t go beyond that in view of the binding terms and conditions of using their products. But I think few people would want to do that.want to tell them in person?  1 866 562 7219- Customer Care. is their free phone number.

if you go to options before composing the message and write the signiture as long as you save it when you send a message it will be displayed.in the right top hand corner of your mail window you will find the options link. Chose mail options and then the 'compose' tab. here you can create your signature block, which will then be used for every message you create. If you don't want it for some messages, simply delete it out of that specific message.Go to options and set your signature, but unlike REGULAR yahoo mail, I can't find the option to UNSET the signature for each individual email which I miss because some I want to HAVE the sig, and some I don't.  Anyway, I've been back to regular Yahoo for a while till they work out the kinks because Beta doesn't even have the option of my COMIC SANS font which I've been using for 10 years online and it's easiest on the keys [they work faster with that font.... yes that IS Strange but true that each font has a different pressure on the keys] so Beta is missing several features that regular yahoo has and it disturbs me, although I like the Pop 3 format of Beta [it's like Outlook etc.] but have to sacrifice too many convenient features that I hope they work out and am waiting.   Feel free to email me if you like.   Good luck

When using Yahoo Mail, I find it easiest to save the doc to the desktop.  Then "Attach Files" in the Yahoo Email.  Go to your desktop and attach the file you want..

It stands for "really simple syndication" and its used on pages that are updated regularly.  If you have a program called a Rss Reader, you won't have to check that website to see if its updated with new info - your reader will do that for you.  Then you just give a glance at your 'reader' to see if any of the pages you've subscribed to have any new information on them.. . MY YAHOO is a way to use RSS - you subscribe to any page that has an rss feed and then when you go to your my Yahoo page, it tells you which of those have new information and which are just the same old stuff.RSS is Really Simple Synidcation or Rich Site Summary.  There are two ways to use it, as  smart book marks, like in FireFox, or you can use an RSS news reader.  It's just another way to get data to you.  It's kind of like a news feed.Your browser is so old!. . How old is it?. .

The fix.. 1). Log into Yahoo! Messenger.. 2). Click on Messenger.. 3). Click on My Contact Details.. ~If you want to have your First Name only, delete your Last name.. ~If you want to use the Nickname field, delete your First and Last name and enter the name you would like to see in the IM box in the Nickname field.. ~If you want only your Account ID to show, leave all fields blank.. 4). Always click Apply and OK when making any changes.. . The reason...... you probably signed up for a Yahoo! Messenger Account using your First/Last name.  They will show in the IM window when you send an IM or receive an IM from another user, unless you change it.    . . That does not mean the other person you are chatting with can see your First/Last name. Your Contact Details must be sent to them. If you have not sent your Contact Details to the other person you are IMing with, they will see your Yahoo! Account Name (or Nickname) and not your First/Last Name. . . If you have previously sent your Contact Details to the other person, they will need to delete you from their list and re-add you in order for you name to change on their list.. . For addition explanation and information go to http://www.chatauthority.com/changename. http://www.chatauthority.com/editcontactinfogo to profiles  click edit then change it BEST ANSWERYou can click on Messenger in the menu bar and then click My Contact Details. Put in a nickname or a name that you want people to see and save it.
try saving it as a .txt  or a .doc  . . play around with saving it in different formats and I would save it to the desktop and try again.. . good luckCheck the name, sometimes names with commas in it or any other punctuation marks will not go through.

theres two ways to answer this. first is if you want copies of your pictures you'll find them in the sent folder in your mail box.. but if your asking how to get back pictures you already sent then I'm sorry to say you most likely cant!. Several mail services do offer a way to remove E-mails that have yet to be read but once the person opens that their asked to open and save photos...once that's been done their in another persons hard drive and untouchable from your end.If you use Yahoo E-mail it will be in your sent folder forever!
Most have a "printer friendly" option that lets you skip the ads or just copy the email text and then paste it to Word.Hi .. . the closest format to outlook you can get is by clicking on the printable view button found in the top right corner of the message and then print the email from the newly opened window.. . Good luckAfter logging on to Y! Mail Beta, open up any message in your inbox. Click on Print. The window pops up to display the printable message. You will then determine how many copies you want made (depending on the printer being used on your computer), and you can print out your email from there. That's the way you have your message printed without the annoying ads.
Have her sign into Yahoo! Messenger.  Click on Messenger on the menu, click on Preferences, click on General.  Uncheck "Automatically start Yahoo! Messenger".When the messenger opens, left-click on messenger, scroll down to Preferences...Click on 'general' and the first option there is 'when i start up my computer;' uncheck that first box. Also,on the very front of the ym window are the options of 'remember my id' the next is automatically sign in...you'll have to uncheck that too.. . hope that helps...if that doesn't work, i would uninstall, then re-install ym, and make sure you don't click the box that says to automatically launch ym when you start your computer.Look under preferences.  Then click General.  If you remove the check from the very first box and click apply that should take care of it. . . Preferences ---> General ---> Automatically Start Yahoo Messenger

I agree.. I'm a female.. it makes my answers look like they are from a man!Good question!

If you log on and click on your points or level #. (They are to the left side) There is a table that explains the point system. But basically it takes 5 points to ask a question, and you receive 2 points when you answer a question and 10 points when your answer is rated as the best answer. So, you have to answer questions to ask questions. But once you have reaches a certain amount of points and you have reached a certain level, you can ask as many questions as you want and you don't need the points anymore.Points encourage participation. The more points you have, the more questions you can ask and answer every day.some tips on how to move up the levels as quick as possible..... . if you ask a question you lose five points but if you select the best answer you get three back. so make sure you select a best answer yourself. . . if it goes to a vote you just lose the five points. . . also when you give an answer you earn 2 pts and if its picked as the best answer you get 10pts. its in your best interest to give an interesting answer if you want to get a best answer. also if your answer is selected as best answer and has thumbs up you get points for each thumbs up ( up to 50 ),. . dont answer with answers such as 'no', 'yes', 'ok', 'i dont know' ' you cant' 'thanks for the 2 points' 'hmm' are not answers and people will report you for them. its in the community guidelines whats acceptable and what isnt. you also lose 10pts if you your question or answer is removed for abuse.. . voting on an answer will get you 1 pt.. . hang in there, we were all at your level once and know how you feel. good luck and have fun.. . http://answers.yahoo.com/info/scoring_system.phpcan you pick mine as the best ans so i can get 10 points?   . they matter to me hehein my opinion, many of the yahoo answer users feels good when they were chosen as the best answer. i don't know why, but it's a natural feeling.Stroking the ego. .          I AMThe points earn you more priveleges and time on the website.  There is a certain amount of prestige at reaching higher levels.  And, it's kind of like running on a track team:  you are competing against yourself, previous records that have been broken, etc.. . I???mia??†you lose 5 points for asking, 2 points per answer and  point for voting to resolve a question.  So the more help you give by answering then you'll get more points and voting as well to progress to higher levels.  The highest level is 7.yahoo had this brilliant idea to have a site where people could ask questions and get them answered.  But the problem is, if everybody just asked questions, nobody would ever get an answer!  So, in order to be able to ask a question, you have to earn enough points to ask it by answering other peoples' horribly difficult questions.  For example, if I really needed points to ask how long to fry an egg for, I would have to answer questions for other people in order to earn points to ask the question.  The only problem with this is that people don't actually answer the question and put something stupid to just get points.  Hope that helped!Go to your Q & A page. Click on the ? in front of the words (Total Points).....itll tell you everything you need to know about the points system.The points are worth nothing, they just help you gain a level.  High leve people are here more often.. . You get more point if you have a best answer.  . . If you pick my answer...I get 2 points for just answering you , . . 10 points if you pick my answer as the best.  . . then if i get a thumb up I get one point per tumbs up.. . It is fun and adicting.  Yahoo, give you nothing for adding to there information bases.When you get to level 2 you can rate questions.. .  POINTS:. -5 points for askin a question. +2 for answering one. +10 for getting a best answer. . LEVELS:. level 2: 250 points. level 3: 1,000 points. and so on.... . ANSWERS:. level 1: 20. level 2: 40. level 3: 60. level 4: 80. level 5: 100. level 6: 120. level 7: 140
Because you must have just reached the points level to qualify for Level 2, but by asking a question and losing 5 points, it's automatically sent you back below that level.  Hurry up and choose a best answer and you'll get 3 back, then just answer a question, or vote for a couple of answers that are 'In Voting' and you'll go back up to Level 2 again. (Or you should do!!).  Have fun!Your total points probably went down into the level one range.  Vote on some answers to get your points back up.points have gone downI must of takeng you down below the level two point mark e.g.. . Level 2 =100 points. you spend 5 points. . 100-5=95. . 95 points=levle 1Well, you went down to level one because you asked a question; asking a question will cost you 5 points, so in order to get back to level 2, you have to vote for a best answer, or answer questions, hope you get to level two.Ur points hav gone down.Try answering and rating questionsIf you had between 250 and 254 points when you asked the question, you would have got down to between 245 and 249 points afterwards. Your points will reflect the level you're on.they take away points and you haven't got enough for the next level
you go to start control panel then go to users accounts then its gonna say something bout making another account your smart enough to finish the restto do so go to start.. click on the picture on the top that says administator or whatever.. click on cancel if you do not want to change the picture.. then on the top on the side,there is a button that says related tasks.. click on there and there should be a link to create a new account.. Hope I Helped! : - )just make another the same as the first except different username and password... i do it all the timenot exactually sure what you mean .. . Are you talking about your ISP or about your Yahoo nickname with email etc.. . If you want another Yahoo idenity, you simply sign up for a new email addy. You can change some of your personal data.. Many people have more than one  yahoo ID.. . You can exit your email or messanger and where it says sign in again, there will be a place that says "sign not as this user " referring to the nick name you just used to get to that email.. . . If you are wanting a seperate and different isp provider you have to download one from perhaps a free disk that comes in the mail.. . I am not sure why you would do that.. . You can also, where you sign in on your isp you can add different people...but they need to know your password. For example when my daughter is here and wants to check her yahoo email.. I let her log on with her nick and she turns her head and I put in the password.
Go to options in your mail folder..And it will give you a list of things that you can change..Go to Mail Options.  It should have a signature link to get you what you need.Click on Options and then on Signatures. Then you can put in one and save it.
I can only speak for myself but I think you blogs are simply too long.  You have very interesting topics and it is well-written. However I think overall after a few paragraphs people’s mind tends to wonder.. .   If you shorten your blogs just a tad, I think your followers will return.It would might help if you went to other people's blogs and commented on those. You can go to random people's blogs also and that helps add readers to yours. Good Luck.how often are you posting and keywords is still king!!. . Just like any other blog.  Sometimes it maybe be more people shutting off their RSS feed viewers, so you only come up when YOU post new items instead of the feeds.Can't tell, can't see your pageYou have to comment on other users' blogs before more of them read them again. As for your blogs, I've read some of them and found them interesting to read. They're not too intellectual or boring. Your picture is beautiful.

point are like gading your reponds and after so many you gain level. It like playing avedio game. You can use your point to get stuff. And there one that share your point someone else it call charity. While your helping yourself and others learn you can also give to one in need, I think vista frist staring points and how it on the web.You get points for answering questions and the more you answer the higher level you get toPoints encourage participation. The more points you acquire, the more questions you can ask and answer. At different levels, the number of questions you can ask and answer increases. You can currently ask 5 and answer 20 questions a day, but once you get 250 points and are on level 2, this increases to 10 questions and 40 answers daily.At the beginning you have 100 points. If you ask any questions it costs you 5 points. & if you answer any question you gain 2 points. But if the answer is good than u may get more then 2points. as ur points increaces ur level increaces.
above the bar where you put the addresses for the people you want to send the e mail to there is a little thing that says insert contacts and from there you check the contacts that you want the message to be sent to the push the button that says insert checked contactsIt's simple just click on the word addresses then click on the address you want and then your letter that you type on will pop up.The easiest way in both old and new Yahoo is just to click the "To:" next to the addressee field (when you're on the compose page, that is). The email addresses in your address book will pop up in a separate window. Select one or more email addresses, click OK, and it will fill them in for you.After you click on "Compose", a box will open up with a "From Line", a "To Line" and a "Subject Line".

Well, some people answer your questions so nice and helpful because they want to help you and/or they want their answers be chosen as the best answers. But some people give you the rubbish answers because they want two points fast for answering your questions.Becuase some people are  mean for 2 points. They don't want to help you at all. Some people are RUDE.Well, they have very little brains & have no concept of being intelligent. They can be cowards because they don't have to show their faces! Just ignore the ignorant ones, there are quite a few on here who can be very nice!
My answer is :  MK. They hate you.  They hate most of us.It works!

Not possible as yahoo doesn't provide this service.go to the trash can and they should be there if it hasn't been 24 hours, my trash can deletes after one day. god luck.Check your sent and trash folders if there not there then there gone for good.In Yahoo you have the choice in options then general preferences to warn you before you delete. Great as a backup. Look at warnings under messege actions.you go to trash, and it'll show all your deleted e-mails.
ur answer may not be right.try to remember it properly.You can access your account by answering the question or look a bit farther down and put in your email address and they will send you a temp. access password then go to your account and change it.I'm using the system provided by Loginizer.com. to manage all my personal passwords.. It's easy to use and really helpful!. I don't need to remember my passwords anymore.You could try a mispelling of the answer to the security question and see if that allows the account to open. I have accidently done this myself before and it's worked.
The fix.. 1). Log into Yahoo! Messenger.. 2). Click on Messenger.. 3). Click on My Contact Details.. ~If you want to have your First Name only, delete your Last name.. ~If you want to use the Nickname field, delete your First and Last name and enter the name you would like to see in the IM box in the Nickname field.. ~If you want only your Account ID to show, leave all fields blank.. 4). Always click Apply and OK when making any changes.. . The reason...... you probably signed up for a Yahoo! Messenger Account using your First/Last name.  They will show in the IM window when you send an IM or receive an IM from another user, unless you change it.    . . That does not mean the other person you are chatting with can see your First/Last name. Your Contact Details must be sent to them. If you have not sent your Contact Details to the other person you are IMing with, they will see your Yahoo! Account Name (or Nickname) and not your First/Last Name. . . If you have previously sent your Contact Details to the other person, they will need to delete you from their list and re-add you in order for you name to change on their list.. . For addition explanation and information go to http://www.chatauthority.com/changename. http://www.chatauthority.com/editcontactinfoyou cant but if you clik on the pol. you mite can close itchange your profile and preferences  :)on your info change your last name just make it a popular name like i made mine smith...everyone has the last name smith that way if anyone tries to find you they can'tClick on Messenger on the menu bar and then on My Contact Details. Take out your last name or just put in your first name and save.
I don't believe you can retract on Yahoo, only on Outlook as you mentioned.  It would be a nice feature to add thoughIt probably arrived already.
LOL.... Fortunately but unfortunately(losing points), this question is posted. I think that your questions were probably not posting b4 becuz of some problem that the service goes through...sometimes the same thing happens with me...BUT @ LEAST U KNOW U HAVE THIS 1 ON HERE....hehehe... : )If your question doesn't appear, all you have to do is ask it again.. I think it is worse when you are the 31st person to answer a question, your answer doesn't appear, and you can not re answer it, so I have complained to yahoo today about that problem.. I have had the question not appearing problem, don't think it cost me points, but was able to put the question on next time.I can see it!! Well done for successfully posting a question!!simply select your name on the left corner.then go into "your questions"no , you lost more point's this one never made it
There is a lag time, for, I assume, approval by the Gods that the question meets with their criteriaBe sure to click the submit button.. Try refreshing the page as sometimes I have the same problem.. EPatience is a virtue...thank godIt takes a minute or so for them to show up.It usually takes a couple of minutes for the questions to appear in the list.. . Go to your Q&A to verify that the question is there.you must be using invisible type
God Knows!  She is a prat and an idiot.!  Talks crap, incites unease and is fat and ugly to boot!dont know but i would never tire of slapping the mouthy cowwell ur question caught my attention. and i was like....who is julia in the 1st place . then i checked her answer . and  i think i  understand  everything now. and now i say ur right on asking . why??????. but i honestly dont really knowwho is julia?what???????????????????????????????????????????if i hear that girls name again i think im gonna scream.why is everyone so obsessed with julia!
child endangerment is a top priority i can only imagine..iam new here, so i do not know of how to handle the situation, all i can say is report abuse, the flag icon on action bar..when reporting, give any details to back your report upI agree with vinster, it sounds odd you are asking this as your very first question.. . I'm sure there are any number of sex offenders here, registered or not, just like in real life.Great idea...  Lets harass the guy!  He probably got caught mooning someone 20 years ago...  Give it a rest.  I'm tired of hearing about sex offenders.  You want to know why?  I looked at the US department of justice website cause I was curious.  90% of people who commit these sort of crimes are friends and family.  You know what that means?  The guy in your living room is statistically more likely going to molest you or your kids than the guy down the street.  Make sure your own house is ok before you look at others.Why are you asking this. are you trying to avoid being captured ?WHAT THE HECK DO I KNOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Call your local POLICE department and let their "Internet Crimes" division take over. Btw- How and why do you think this person is a sex offender? Did someone email you or did you see this in a chat room? Cause it didn't happen here at "Answers" - you are a level 1 and this is the very first question you've asked , and you have not answered any questions yet.  ....just an observation.http://add.yahoo.com/fast/help/us/privacy/cgi_feedback contact yahoo here. . also cybertip line for reporting pedofiles. http://www.cybertipline.com/I would think if you forwarded the page of him from a sex offender website as an attachment you could inform Yahoo that way, and an explanation of what he is doing wrong now.Is he soliciting anyone on Yahoo? If so, report him to Yahoo and if you know where he lives, you can report him to the local police. If he's not doing anything malicious, there may be nothing you can do. Sexual offenders are not prohibited from using the internet unless they're using it to commit an offense.well has he already been convicted and served his/her time the we can do nothing bc he is registered already. I guess he/she has a right to be on here too. I do not know how you could get him/her kicked off.

They have to ask if they can view your webbi. the only way YOU can invite is by sending them a msgI'm guessing they would have to have YIM aswell.You can't.. . Both instant messengers need to be the same. However there is a programme called trillian that allows you to use multiple IM's at the same time.
Because you small so bad. ByeAre you talking about your Yahoo!Answers account? The only thing I can think of is if you were reported alot, then they can delete your account.
mine does the same thing...i have to exit out and re-enter...then it works but while i'm chatting it disconnects and reconnects and disconnects...and the back again...i hate it...I had some minor problems this morning! I just keep on trying, and now it work....

why in the world would you want to search profiles, , , most people are people, , , that should be enough information.. . anyone putting information other than that in a profile is after something.. . you looking for a trick, , , or are you looking to become a trick?What "Adult Profiles" are you looking for?  To find what you are looking for you probably need to plug in exactly what you are looking for.  Chances are they have it or they don't, depending on what you are searching for.  I hope I've answered your question somewhat.Dude, when you find out, could you let me know?. Thanks

Tools > Internet Options > Content > AutoComplete > Clear Forms. This will clear out ALL your autocompleted forms, such as search windows, form fill-ins, etc. You can also reset your Auto-Complete options here.. . Or, to delete just a single (or a few) searches, just have them highlighted in the drop-down list and hit DELETE -- they will vanish! If you hold down the key, the whole drop-down list of searches will delete.. . If you are using the Yahoo! Toolbar, I believe there is a drop-down box at the end of the search window that has the option to CLEAR SEARCHES on it.. . Clearing your history only clears out the PAGE locations that you have recently visited.Click on the pencil icon, in the drop down menu click on the 'Clear Recent Searches'.Try highlighting each one, one by one and hitting the delete key.. Another way is to go to Tools>internet options>clear historyTo clear the yahoo search bar, go to the pencil near the search bar and a drop down box appears.. you will see clear history. that will clear everythingTRY HIGHLIGHTING THEM ONE BY ONE AND HIT THE SHIFT & DELETE KEYS AT THE SAME TIME TO DELETE THEM

So we can keep coming back. Another addiction to add to the list!You are still at level one. You need to answere to your limit each day and try to get best answers as they are 10 points. By level 4 at about 3,500 points, you could not possibly reach the limit any more.level 2 you can only answer 40 a day,you think that is to make us want to get more points?that is stupid dont  knoSince the higher the levels the more answering you get, The Yahoo! Answers Team wants you to go to higher levels.Since you're on Level 2, you have been limited to answer up to 40 questions a day. Sorry, but that's just the rules.
We truncate longer web addresses and very long words, so the preview screen makes sure someone isn't taken by surprise. From the preview, you can also see any words that aren't allowed on Yahoo! Answers, so you can change them accordingly before they're removed later. We'll consider a more direct method, though, or see if there's a way we can streamline it more.I like to check for spilling erors two. heeheeit gives you a chance to reword or repose the query.. . you get a look of it to see if even YOU can decipher it, rather than just expecting others to be able to. . . It works, but much flotsam gets through. But give jane the BA, you may curry favor if you do.cos you need to see what you are sendingThe preview option is nice, sometimes my hands get ahead of me.  I like checking for the spelling errors, which I seem to make a lot of.toughFrankly I like the preview feature. I mean you get a chance to review what you've typed and make the neccessary corrections without posting it first. You should know that a lot of people complain about spelling and grammar on this site and often the idea of why a question was asked or an answer given could be lost or misinterpreted by bad spelling and grammar. I do admit that the preview feature would be nice when asking a question (not sure if they have it now, haven't asked a question in a while).I hear ya, BUT..  Yahoo is probably trying to get those kids to stop spelling like morons.
Clear your cache and internet history using the tools  pulldown menu on the browser. Choose internet options.If you want to delete individual addresses without deleting them all from your drop down menu Click the Start button and then click on Search, all files and folders, and type in History find the one that is located in Local Settings.  There you will find every website you entered in the last week most likely then delete the one you want gone.  If you have the new IE7 then click the star (favorites) at the top left of your browser default it will show your favorites but at the top of the list you can change to History, there it will also show the list of that week sorted by day, delete as necessary

On Internet Explorer 7 click the gold star on the left of the toolbar, or press Alt + c on your keyboard to get your Favorites, and if you want the Menu Bar with File, Edit, View, Favorites, Tools, and Help to show, click Tools (an icon that looks like a gear) on the bottom right of the toolbar, a menu pops up, click Menu Bar, or right click a vacant space on the toolbar, a menu pops up, click Menu Bar. . .

This way your toolbar doesn't take up as much of your screen. If you want it to stay permanently, right click on a vacant space on the toolbar and click Menu Bar.. . I suggest you take the Internet Explorer 7 Tour.. http://www.microsoft.com/windows/ie/ie7/tour/fre/default.mspx. . These links can also be helpful.. http://www.microsoft.com/windows/ie/community/columns/ie7_toolbar.mspx. http://www.uwec.edu/help/internet.htmAt least two other questioners here asked about missing favorites after "upgrading" IE7.  Many others just asked how to downgrade to IE6.. . My advice:. . Uninstall IE7.. Then forget about IE.. . Install Firefox 2.0. . Customize your Firefox browser with add-ons and bring back the enjoyment of surfing the web. Think you need IE? Install "IE tabs" add-on.. . (You'll even be given the option to import your IE favorites.). . Good LuckIf you just loaded IE7, there is a gold star icon and a green plus sign over a gold star icon next to your destination tab. The gold star lets you see your favorites and history. The plus sign and gold star icon save your favoritesYou lost them all.
If it still is not working for you. Check to make sure you have it enabled. You have the option.it works. and is still working the last time i checked.
I can't believe there are still places where they still use that outmoded Fahrenheit system.You must click on the weather temperature and the next page: the weather page has F/C. Click on the C and it'll convert the temperature to Celsius. But it's better to learn Fahrenheit if you live in America. I lived abroad and learned Celsius.
yeah....dont worry it not your computer or internet connection....I think it is just a work in progress.... ( i experience  the same thing). . JustinIf you download a lot of stuff like music, or it couls be the internet version you have.  also if you dont want to double click on the mail so you dont have to wait for it to load, just tap V on your key board and it will show up under your inbox.I think it is because there are more features taking up more disk space.maybe it's just your computer or the internet version you use.try yahoo beta it is faster and easier to use than old yahoo.
Hello Shirley,. If you are referring to yahoo chat they like to look for ways to screw with ppls minds.If U mean  the Israeli chat "Mohamed Yahoo " look> they  like to  get  keystroke logging  ads spy ware pop ups and advertisements  in your PC, why else would anyone go to the expense. I'M considering dropping yahoo  all together including mail and answers  I notice the  other day my  Internet explorer search engine has been changed to ya hooed w/o my permission  and there's no  UN_DO feature.. I called my isp and they rec commend I re-install my entire system  after a  clean and scrub operation on my hdd,,, thank you so much Mohammad Sultan<  yahoo owner... for screwing up my IE  search engine... oh and for boosting your own search engine yahoo by  using this  sneaky  q and a  forum  bye~
Check all and deleteJust don't use your e-mail IDs for more than 3 months and they'll automatically delete your accounts for disuse, Sir.. . Unfortunately, till they're deleted people sending e-mail there will not know that you're not using them, Sir.. . Once the accounts are deleted, though, they'll get the Mailer Daemon message telling them that this user doesn't exist.I don't know anything about deleting your Hotmail account other than you don't login for 60 days. As for deleting your Y! Mail account, go to https://edit.yahoo.com/config/delete_user and enter your username and password.I'm not trying to be smart but more than likely there are instructions to do.So just take some time and patience to find out .
usually, you'll get a requwst from yahoo, asking if u would like to be on someone's messenger, if u say no. u wontYou'll know once they IM you and notify you.  Or if they send you an invite do so.If you mean someone’s Buddy List – unfortunately method to check this doesn’t exist. If you haven’t noted names of people which request you have approved and then deleted them – no way to know.
omg...I get those all the time...I don't know what's wrong, I just don't bother trying to use 'em...I just use my email.What do you mean by 'over the l'. Anyways, the most common cases why outlook would refuse to send e-mail are because you are exceeding the quantity of people you can send a single e-mail or because you exceeded the limit of the size of your e-mail.
Easy.All u have 2 do is go to www.yahoo.com.Then go to where it says Free mail: Sign Up (it is right by where it says Check your mail status: Sign In).After you click Sign Up (it should underline when you put your mouse to it) all u have to do is fill out the rest of the sheet & ur ready 2 go!...If u already have a yahoo but don't no how 2 use it u first click the Sign In.Then u it will say Yahoo! ID: (put what u would do if u were giving ur e-mail out to someone[username@yahoo.com {just don't put @yahoo.com} ] ) then put ur password, then press Enter (Sign In).After that click on the envelope (it says Mail right beside it).Then click on another envelope (it will be smaller then the first one you clicked).Then it should give u your mail!Now, all u have to do is give people ur e-mail address here...mine is jasmynsullivan@yahoo.com! w/b!just go to yahoo.com and creat an accont-go to www.yahoo.com. -click for sign up and kindly follow the procedures... . . do not worry.. it's so easy..same way u signed up last time. how or why r u asking this question?that's the very easy dear! when you are in yahoo homepage just find the word sign-up and click it or click any yahoo mail envelope icon and it will bring you to its page where you are asked to sign-in in the main portion a....and below you will see a question if you have not already sign-up. just click that portion..don't worry yahoo won't eat you.
Click back, and trying clicking on the message again. Also, sometimes people send blank messages by mistakeWhat sucks is when you can't SEND an e-mail. What the hell's up with that? I can insert addresses and subjects, but no body.I had the exact same problem and resolved it by going to Options>General Preferences and then checking "Do not show me Yahoo! Shortcuts"
Because they can and normally get away with it, with their . automatic billing system. Call your bank and tell them to block. any further attempts to bill your account.Because Sally in new accounts isnt up to date on her work load..
Probably the person's email you're sending it to is deleted and you can't send it. Because that's usually the problem.is the Mailer-Daemon sends you a messege containing that the message that you're trying to send is cannot be sent because there's an error about your message?or the recipients email add is incorrect?..well if yes that is a  common error.....
Zoom-Zoom-zoomzen.. . Wanted something chilly and intellectual :-)). . I have great affection for the Zen philosophy...Mine means Im a mystery....always have been and always will be.Mines TJ, cuz TJ is my name! You might think its weird that my parents named a girl TJ, but i like the name TJ! It makes me sound...umm...not so girly!I chose mine because I like getting ink done :-)"Bibliophile" means "book lover."   It's self-explanatory.My momma gave it to me.multiple names: change depending on the mood.. . u"masked" when I'm in a silly questioning mood. . Dr Education when I'm in a serious questioning/answering mood. . Dr. SexPert when I'm answering sexual question.  . .

When it's changed it changes for all.Ah Ah my boyfriend deformed my name to this one, so i use for Yahoo.mine is magurl..because im a in martial arts and IM A GIRL!
EVERYTIME Yahoo! downloads new software, the whole system goes squirrellyThe same thing just happened to me.  They must have had some wierd glitch.  Hopefully it got figured out.technical difficulties beyond my control...It happened to me, I was able to sign in to Yahoo, but Yahoo Answers didn't have my profile.that same problem happened to me also.  i was trying to answer this one math question for someone, and i had to type in my password a lot of times.  i just gave up and answered another question.the same thing happened to me.  I tried it a couple of times and typed very slowly so I know I spelt it right and made sure it was in the right case.just happened to me too, thought i got my password wrong.happened to me too..dunno whats up
Exit Windows the proper way instead of just turning your PC off.. . Then it will save you settings.I have yahoo widgets, and the ones I have when I turn my computer off always start up again when I turn it on. I suggest uninstalling the widget engine and installing it again. Good luck.
View the question before it is four days old. Hover your pencil over the toolbar and choose the option "Extend expiration".If it's already closed or resolved I don't think you can. Probably should post a new question - just include all the details so you don't get answers that you already know.Ask the question again but in a different way.You can't.  Once it is closed, it is closed.  You can repost, but that is a violation.Just ask the question again.you can't! after you delete it its done for! well i tried to the same but i never found a solution.
Either check insert address and your address book will comw up, check name, and insert contact, or go to mail options on top right, general preferences. and at bottom check auto complete and save. When you want to type in an address after the first letter or two address (es) will show beneath TO. Just hit enter.beacuase when you type in an e-mail address you need to tell them exactly were to send it because if u were to send somthing to a yahoo account and sum 1 on hotmail had the same name then how does it know whitch 1 to send it to? that is why there is an address book so u dont have to type in the whole e-mail just type in the persons name and it will fill everything in for youYou don't have to. You can select the first name, surname, or nickname of the person on the address.you may have auto-complete unchecked from your Internet options. If so check it and it should work. Otherwise it is either not offered thru your email provider or your security has disabled it.Are you talking about Yahoo email? If so, you don't have to go through all that trouble. I was doing so too, until I found that you can use the address book, on your yahoo account. Just click on Address tab, then on the tab that says, New contact. Type in your friends or family email address. Soon you will have an list of names with email addresses. Now when you compose a letter, to send someone a letter, click on the To: next to where you'd normally type an entire Long address. When you click To: Up will pop your address book, with your email address. click on the square you want the letter to go to, click the tab that's reads, insert contact. Your choice will insert automatically the email address in the To: box.  You can do this will more than just one address, if sending a forward or letter to everyone you know.. . Hope this helps!well sweety if you already have that person in the address it should pop up and just click on it so you dont have to type it  allIf someone is in your address book, then auto fill will make it so you don't have to.. . I hope I understand your question. It occurred to me that maybe you are talking about something else.Use the address book. Check contact and send mail.It depends on what email account you have. With yahoo, it has auto address book which lets you just type the first letter and you choose.
in Y! Mail. My Account (next to sign out) > verify password > edit password and/or usernameOnce, I asked this exact question, and the answerer told me... " It's not really considered changing your e-mail address. It's called switching to a brand new one. You would have to terminate your old account and open up a new one, but be warned that picking a new name is SO difficult, since millions and millions of people are using Yahoo! everyday and more and more are coming along, so you should really keep what you have now. " And I totally agreed.once u made a log in and a p word u cnt change themu cant change ur login ID....u have to register again with another ID....u can turn the "email forward" option ON in ur old email so the emails could automatically forwarded to ur new email. . for changing ur password...just go into the inbox...click on the downward triangle on the left top most tab on "Mail" and select "option". Then click on "account information". ...u may have to enter ur passwward...click on change password option...then enter ur old password...then new one twice....

There should be a top menubar and all you do it click that and select add website to bookmarks/favorites. just check the top bar.the fourth tab from the left corner of the computer.. favourites-- click that and then the first one underneath it says add to favourites...If you just loaded IE7, there is a gold star icon and a green plus sign over a gold star icon next to your destination tab.

When pasting, use Edit | Paste Special | Paste as: . Unformatted text.. I think Yahoo may have change some of their formating but this worked for me.you might have not selected correctly and cut it sharp for pastingThe other guy who answered your question is an asshat. I am sure that you know how to copy things on the screen and I know I can. But I have the same problem. Not sure why it started doing this. Did you ever get it figured out?
This problem occurs when the servers are very busy or yahoo is having problems and working on the system.  You just have to be patient when this happens.It's a problem with the email server.  I had the same problem with yahoo a while back.  The receiver of my email would get the mail the next day or 6 hours later.Hours are not anything. How about sorting millions or trillions of emails yourself. You are not the only one in this world. I`m always thankful I received a message. Think of all the spam that is useless going around that outnumbers regular messages.Your thinking is acceptable,anyway the person who sent to you an email,might be the server of their  ISP is busy or temporarily closed,so when they sent email ask them to sent  by marking top priority.Usually they might be sending "normal" but even you are supposed to receive it within 5 minutes times if you are on line.If you have not sign up the email will be loaded and when you sign up you can see it.Ask your friends to sent to you on TOP PRIORITY basis,for that they don't have to pay extra charges.Some of the email contains pictures so Microsoft Direct X services show up your email half way.If you don't have Direct X down load from the window website.DirectX9 it's free.
Don't ever give out passwords or personal info. Ever.Get a new computer, there is something that is really wrong with it. DO NOT I repet DO NOT give out ur info on the net!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Go to the control panel in your computer and then Add/Remove software.  Once that is up look for the yahoo toolbar.  It will probably be at the bottom of all the selections.  Then click on remove.At the top of the screen click View then hold the mouse over toolbars and then click yahoo. This should work.. Than again, do you mean remove from system or remove from view while the internet is open? Either way, both answers have been answered. Thanks!
It depends on what kind of computer and programs that you have. If you had a Macintosh, that is easily accomplished right in iPhoto. You can also use Adobe Photoshop Elements or Photoshop. Simply "Save For Web" and the photo file size will be reduced for e-mail.I have windows 2000 and when I put a picture in an email it allows me to place my cursor at the edge or corner and size it however I like, right in the email.  My mother can't open large emails without too much time wasted and I was able to size it down so that it wouldn't be too large for her.  If you have "Imaging" you should be able to convert the picture to a thumbnail as well.well, the first thing you can do is right click on your picture and it should say somewhere on there "small image, large image" and some other stuff. click large image.
When you log onto yahoo messenger....search for my yahoo...it will take you there and you can create your own yahoo page..you can add all that interest you on there.

LOL.....This has happened to me a few times babe just a fault my internet, maybe you pressed preview and not submit then clicked on something else?? iv done that few times xxThis can happen. Since 360 is a beta product, sometimes there can be some hitches. Try logging out of  Yahoo and then logging in again! The same happened to my blog one day and the post just reappeared.. . I just took a look at your blog and it looks just fine! I love your poetry!
Which beta are you talking about?. There are no levels in Yahoo Mail (beta or otherwise).. In yahoo answers, you need 250 points to get to level 2.You have to get 250 + pointsHi,. There is no such thing.  What is it you really want to know?  I will give you several things to work with.. . . I found this in What's New In Mail:. We’re wrapping up a few remaining compatibility issues between Yahoo! Mail Beta and the new Microsoft Internet Explorer 7.0 Beta, and we’ll open up our Beta to their Beta towards the end of this month. Folks on the bleeding edge, please sit tight! . This applies to almost all mail (including signing in, composing, receiving, sending, attachments, photos etc.) and search problems for the last two weeks.. . So, It appears we have to un-install these two things or try to work around them. . http://wap.oa.yahoo.com/. For different areas of Yahoo!. . For those who can't get in at all try this as it seems to be working for a few.. http://myyahoo.com. Login on My Yahoo! page. Select the link at top right to go to Yahoo!'s Home Page.. Mouse over the Mail Icon under where it says (Hi, your Yahoo! id).. You should get a drop down menu with your latest emails displayed.. Select an email and click it. You then get to a new page about Shortcuts, but just select the button for Mail and it should take you to your Mail page.. It wasn't getting redirected to the shortcuts page on some servers and not going to the mail page.. This is also working for some:. Click the "Options" link in the upper right of your Mail page. . On the Options page, in the "Management" column, click on "General Preferences". . Find the "Composing E-mails" section, "Mode:", and choose "Compose messages as plain text". . Scroll to the bottom and click the "Save" button. . Now try it. Can you Compose, Reply to a message or Forward? . This is working for some also:. Make sure your screen resolution is 1024 by 768 pixels. Right click on your desktop, click Properties, click the "Settings" tab, left click and hold on the screen resolution bar and drag it all the way to the right, click Apply and click OK..

Messenger seems to be doing a lot of strange this these past few daysI have no idea.Because the UK version on Messenger doesn't have Yahoo Chat, only the silly Lycos version. Click on the link below and install the US version, to restore the original Yahoo Chat.. . I don't deserve a 'thumbs down' for this answer!  boo, hoo!
You need to download Java from http://java.com/ to run the beta.maybe you typed in your username or password wrong..what does it say when you log in? You should of wrote some more info..
it depends on what you are using for e-mail.  If your using Outlook or outlook express you wnat to right click and hit delete.  If you are using a web based e-mail (like yahoo, not the bata version, or hotmail) click the checkbox next to the e-mail and click the delete button (at the top or bottom of the page).  Hope this helps!if you are talking about an account you have to loginClick the empty button next to the word Spam, bulk, or trash. And it will delete everything without you having to even look at it.just switch back to the old versionYahoo! Mail offers two ways to delete individual messages: . . While viewing the contents of your inbox or another folder, click on the checkbox to the left of the message you would like to delete and click the "Delete" button at either the top or bottom of the list of messages. . If you're reading a message, you can click the "Delete" button at either the top or the bottom of the message. . If you're trying to delete several messages at once, this is the fastest way to do so: . . . Click the "Mail Options" link on the top right navigation bar and choose "General Preferences." . Find the Number of Messages (displayed at one time) heading and increase the value to 200 (the maximum). . Scroll to the bottom of the screen and click the "Save" button. . Return to the folder which contains the messages you would like to delete. . Click the "Check All" link (located beneath the list of messages or on the check box located to the right of the "sender" heading,) Clicking this link will select the first 200 messages in the folder (or all of the messages, if the folder contains less than 200). . Click the "Delete" button to delete the selected messages. . Repeat the above step for each screen full of messages in the folder, until all of the unwanted messages have been moved to the trash folder. . Aside from this method, there is no specific way to delete a particular folder's entire contents at once. When you delete messages in Yahoo! Mail, they're transferred to your trash folder. If you delete a message by mistake, you can find it in the trash and move it to your inbox or another folder in order to recover it. Please note that messages in your trash folder do not count against your quota. However messages in your trash folder can be deleted at any time without warning. . . To permanently remove the contents of the trash, click the "Empty" link next to the trash folder in the left navigation bar. Next, you will see a prompt asking if you're sure you want to delete all messages. Click "Yes" to delete or "No" to return to the previous page. . . Please Note: Once messages are emptied from the trash folder, they are permanently deleted from the Yahoo! Mail server and cannot be recovered.Right click on the email and then you should be able to go down and Delete should be one of the options.. . Or, single click on the title of the email and then press the Del key (below Insert and near Home/End). That should delete the email!
you download an instant messenger and add a contact. then you click on that person and click send message and type your message to them and hit send.In the bottom right hand corner of your screen you should see a smily face. Double click that, then double click the name you want to send a message to. If you don't have contacts. Go to "Contacts" at the top, click it then click "Add a Conatct".. . Hope that helped!look on their profile and see if its availible, or just send them an email asking for their Imessage. Profile
Into Yahoo or your computer? If its you computer you can change that.

Hope you can sort it from here, i'm no computer whizz.. Good luck. Handy Andy
usually there is a link that says delete all or a checkbox that says deletethere is a button above all that says sender click on that and all e-mails should be highlighted and then just click delete.. . . hope that helpedHighlight all the emails in your inbox that you would like to delete then click delete button.  But you may still need to delete them from trash.. for that just click the empty next to trash folder. . E

I believe that is the same thing as a Hicky,if you know how to do that then you have given a purple nurple.By twisting a tit very hard that it hurts with 2 fingers. . Not advisable to give one or to recieve one as they hurt and may cause damage to your breast(s) such as cancer. . (Sorry for being tacky but this is true)pinch the nipple and twist. this is often done through a shirt. use the technique sparingly.you grab someones nipple and twist it. "purple" as in bruise. not so much a nice thing to do - but popular with teenage boys who like to hurt eachother for stupid fun.grab the nipple and twist

The Yahoo! ID IS the email address without the @yahoo.comit's probably either the id @yahoo.com or if you know that they use yahoo dsl, it's @sbcglobal.netIt is the user ID with @yahoo.com after itUsually the Yahoo ID is the email address.You don't get it any other way than the individual permitting you to see. So when charting request for it. Thanksyou just answered your own question. most people who have a yahoo ID have an email account under the same screen name. so it would be "their screen name@yahoo.com"
that depends on if it is a paid for aol aim account or a free aim account.I don't think you can.  I had made up a number of silly user names a long time ago and found there was a limit and that it was impossible to delete the garbage ones.  So I don't think it will let you delete anything.
you can't help thinking about him, you got a kid wit him! just do your best at work and look after you and the kiddy - you will have all the respect and he will be wondering why he's thinking about you!!obviously you are not over him yet.a new child must be a lot of work for a single mother but hang in there eventually things will settle and you will get over him.if the child ever asks about their dad then you will be in a tight situation bet don't worry I'm sure you can handle it.and as far as playing sick at work he of course isn't good enough for you so it was for the best. .                                        a caring friend.                                                     alainaI don `t mean to be harsh , but you where used and you let yourself be used. Learn from this. Raise your child to be strong and independent, loving only to those who deserve it. Perhaps your mistakes will bring much benefit to the child .By the way you describe him , he doesn't deserve you. He is an irresponsible guy who, it seems, doesn't care about you.. Forget about him and bring up your baby the best you can.Well, on the bright side, you now have a beautiful baby to take care of. Keep the job you have until you find something better. Try and stay positive and know that the situation will get better. There are people in life we cant help no matter how much we love them. You cant stop thinking about him...because first off, he's the father of your child and secondly...you have to see him everyday. The best way to move on with you life is to accept that this is the way it is, there's nothing you can do with him. He doesnt want the child that his SPERM created, that's fine, so he doesn't get to be a part of that childs life. There are other men out there. You have something real to live for and that's you and your baby. Keep you head up. Most men are just lousy!!!i no exactly how you feel(not that ive had a baby or nething).  my bf of 8 mths. recently broke up with me, and i had the hardest time getting over it.  i got over it by talking to my friends.  if you cant do that, or if you do do that, and you still cant get over him, either find a new job, or ask if you can be transferred to a new area where you wont see him as much, or at all.Don't you feel embarrassed.He sounds like a real plonker.Your well rid of him. You will find the strength from your baby his dad let him/her down but you never. . Good Luck xThe problem is that he is in your face all the time.  You can't get away from him.  At least try moving so you don't see him in the neighborhood.kellytnolan Is this you? … :)! . http://www.osoq.com/funstuff/extra/extra01.asp?strName=kellytnolanyou can try getting a new job, or working where you already are.. you can also talk with your ex and work out the problem.
did not noticed any changes. but last week they minimized a lot of questions especially if it has a -2 rating.  but you can adjust it back by choosing show all answers in the box provided for.I noticed sometimes my computer does this so I called tech support and it was actually something that I did.  I accidentally changed my text size and it made everything look different.  I don't know how to fix it, but call your tech support and they can probably guide you through it.i wish they would quit making so many changes at once..it just makes things more confusingMine does not look funny. just the same as always
It took me an hour in 56k. It is big.it shouldn't even take a minute.  What's your internet speed?Depending on your ISP is what determines the speed of your download.  Also depends on the speed of your computer or laptop.  . . There is no other site that will provide you with a download that is faster then another.  . . (you might want to also try emptying some of the junk that is on your computer....  in order to make more room and clear space for yahoo to load...  Hit me up if you need more information on that). . GOOD LUCK. ciao

They are still there but Yahoo made it to where you can only access them by going through Yahoo Messegner. But all the rooms is full of bots anyway.Hi,. . Do to people hacking the yahoo sever I have seen yahoo take action bye taking down user rooms however they are planning on put the user rooms back up by the end of the year.. . Thanks,. Matt F.didnt know they were gone.

Right click folder, send to compressed zip file, attach zip file to email. Double click at other end and extract items to expand.. . You do not need WinZip. It is built into Windows XP.The only real way to do that is to zip it up, with WinZip or a similar archiving program... also may save space...
when you write an e-mail you'll see an attach files or add e-mail attachments and then click the browse botton. find the folder where you saved all your pictures and open it, then you'll see the pictures and be able to select what you want to send. then click attach files.I'm not totally fulmilular with what your working with... but when you clcik "browse" to open a file to attatch.. do you have the option to change the view of the file from "list" to "Thumbnail"? This should give you a mini-image of the fileMake sure they have the right method to be attached, then click on 'add attachments.' 'browse,' and then click on one. click 'add attachment' and then click SEND when your message is done.
if you go to the bulk  inbox you have  a method of choice about what to do with mail that has been sent to your bulk box erroneously, you can move them to your inbox and yahoo will redirect them next time to your inbox. It's real simple although my explaination doesn't soud easy.because they are spam turn it off and it will go in your inbox
Tools, popup blockerYou must turn your blocker off.  It depends on your program.Underneath the tabs there will be a big yellow rectangle, then you right click it and then click temporarily allow pop ups.Ctrl and Shift at the same time. Turn off block popups is another way.On a 1 time bases, hold ctrl down while entering the site.  If you you want to completly unblock them, it depends what program you have blocking them.  Go into your blcoker and there should be an option to allow pop ups

tell her what yo just told me, over a nice dinner at a good restuarant. shell understand, shes your momJust dont beat around the bush, you need to tell her. Beisided its you mom, she will understand you want a better life for you and your kids. She may be disappointed at first, but give her time to get used to the fact that you lead your own life, and that you will still be there for her.
Thats good to know someone cares. Hope you can help us too when we need it.by sending them emailsyou can always pick the best answer for your question. and the best way you can show how you trully appreciate all the help you got, return the favor to other people.. . have a good one
u cant. once you close the window with the offline messages they erase. it should tell you when you close it.no
If you bcc's everybody, your address will be the only one showing in your sent mail. That's why it is called "BCC".Go to your SENT folder. Pick the message then Show FULL HEADERS.
I asked the yahoo, customer service the same question and was told that only way to do it is to: goto your email options, and where it says how many mails to show per page, increase that numer to 200, and delete those 200 mails at a time. . I know it SUCKS!!!Hmm........begs the question, why do you let it get so full in the first place?Just check off box at left of name, as many as you want they will highlight themselves then check delete. Only the ones you have checked will be deleted.I dont believe you can delete everything all at once.  You will have to delete page by page.  SOrry. . You could change your settings to be able to see 200 emails at a time and therefore making the task easier.in your mail box above all your letters were it says sender, subject, all the way to the left of that row is a little white box, click it
Go into your contact list and click Add List. Once you do that you will see a line below that reads Add Contact to List. Type in the letter A and you will see everyone on your contact list whose names or email addresses start with that letter. Continue with every letter of the alphabet if you would like and then give  your list a name such as friends and  then click save on the top right corner and that's it. Once you have a email you want to send to a bunch of people, you will have the group saved as friends on your contact list. All you have to do is start typing friends and it will forward that email to everyone on that list.Open the email and click the Forward button. Then just type their email addresses in the TO field and separate the addresses by a comma.
you are now.Yahoo is not an internet provider company, so you cannot.you must be if you are posting this questionYou should seriously think about not smoking that stuff!!! 8-)do you mean instant chat? Download yahoo messenger, go to google, put in yahoo messenger, then download for free, then you can do instant messages.If you got here by accident, look for the people and chat icon on your yahoo toolbar. The icon is two toy people close together. After you click on that you can pick a category you like or type a topic in the upper right corner of the page and click on search. If you're looking for a specific site you were already in, try typing in a common word or phrase used in that chat group. Good luck.Ummmmmmm, me thinks you are on here or are you just an illusion......... are you a ginger male or blond femaleYou already are.It's down for work on the servers.You have got to be a TOGG?  You're just having a senior moment!
go to yahoo.com and click on messanger then it will tell you how to do it from thereOn the yahoo homepage you click on messenger and fallow all the steps.Go To http://messenger.yahoo.com And Download It. It Is Very Simple, Just Follow The Directions. But There Are Some Messengers Where You Can Be On Yahoo, Msn & Aim All At The Same Time.Go to http://messenger.yahoo.com and click on the Get It Now link.I'd like to caution you to be careful downloading Yahoo's Messenger. I've used it for over a year and love it BUT the new version has given me no end of grief and if you look at other people's "questions" on this site, you'll find that I wasn't alone. I was only able to resolve by going to the www.tucows.com site and downloading an older version: Yahoo! Messenger 7.0.0.426. ~ which never gave me any problems. Good luck.Go to yahoo.com and in the right upper hand corner it should say messenger. Click that link and follow the directions.Don't. Get Trillian instead. It handles aol,yahoo, and msn messengers all at the same time.
Click on Tools at the top of the page in Internet Explorer and then click Internet options. Select the Content tab and click on Auto Complete at the bottom. You can then click on clear forms and this will clear those entries. You can also turn it off from this same location.on your internet software  ( I.E., MSN, etc) look at the top tool bar for "History" and click delete, and/or go into preferences and find the "history" settings and select to save "0" days of history.
tools, internet options, browsing history and delete. Set history to zero.you should be able to right click onit and click on delete to remove it. you can always go to tools, than internet options and click on clear history and than yes. It's best to do this at least every 3 days and to click on delete or remove  files and cookies and delete them also
Silly. there not the same questions as such. its all the new questions been added moving the others down the page, if you read really quick you can keep ahead of them and hardly ever see them.. Scan the questions dont stop to read them or answer them and you will solve the problemIsn't it ridiculous.Cause they're open ended questions. They don't have a category set, so everything they may touch on is incuded in where its placed.I always click on all categories and just answer ones on there... then I can choose the ones I know I can answer! Hurray!My working hypothesis (well, resting would be a better description ;-) is that a question reappears on the lists each time it's answered. More activity being a sign of greater interest and perhaps worth. Or something like that.. . Questions that are more specialised, and therefore without that popular appeal, seem to fall away very quickly.its very annoying..cos they r repatsIt is annoying, another problem for me is that twice i ahve psoted questions that haven't come up on screen yet my 5 points have been deducted, it comes up in my list of questions but not on the main board.
You will need to sign into Messenger and click on Messenger in the menu bar and scroll over Yahoo! Chat and then click on Join A Room.go to messenger, click on chat icon. follow it from there.. It'll show you the different rooms to choose from. ALL person rooms such as music rooms  have been deleted to please (which is a shame)a few so all you have are yahoo chat rooms.
Have them google "yahoo messenger", pick one of the free download sites, and download it. when they have it, have them add your conntact information, and viola!u go 2 the persons home page and if they're signed in 2 the im, u can im them.. . i'm not a fan of instant messaging.. hopefully some1 braver than me can help.CLIK THE PLUS SIGHN
It depends on if someone reports it as offensive to them.  I had an answer deleted for the following:. . It was a question about Americans and the Atkins diet.  I said that it was no longer popular since the information came out about how bad it is for the heart and health.  Then I said:  Americans tend to be sheeple and follow the fads until they learn more and get educated about it.. . I didn't think that was so bad.... but someone reported it and my answer was deleted.  And I'm an American so I'm speaking of my own people.  Let's face it..... new fads come along all the time, make a flash in the pan, and then someone says that new research shows it isn't good.... and it dies out.  That's all I was talking about and they made it sound like I'd said something horrible.. . Oh well.... It's just internet people.. . Best Wishes,. . SueYeah, it's ridiculous. Yahoo should get off their as$es and do something about the the people you've mentioned as well as that annoying spammer that says something like "finally! a website that makes cash for you!" or some crap like that. Ban the IP addresses already!Someone said  this site is totally automated. . I believe him. He's already at level 7.. . My non-offensive qns got deleted too. . . The qns I asked and got deleted are :. . 1. I have 2 teenage kids at home. They seem to have suddenly become rebellous when they reach 13. Do you have a similar problem ?. . 2.  Do you think Criss Angel is one of the best magicians around today ?. . The above 2 qns were deleted on grounds that they violated "Community Guidelines" . Then I was ushered to a whole list of guidelines but still could not figure out which one I had violated.. . Then I wrote back and asked for a clearer and more specific explanation. Again the idiotic computer gave me the same standard answer and I was stumped. . . How could a harmless comment about my rebellous teenagers cause disharmony to the community , I wonder.. . Maybe someone hated Criss Angel and reported abuse. I strongly believe so.. . Anyway, just wanna say that it really is controlled by an automated system. So no point getting too upset.. . It is impossible for a human to be vetting all the Q & A posted as there are thousands going thru the system every hour.. . The human/s would die of stress and their eyes would pop out !Yes, I think it is.. I had 3 answers removed for no reason, or none I could figure out, but yahoo did reconsider and give me back my points.. I think they give someone a violation and then see if it is really a violation. I think so people just report you for fun or kicks or whatever.. Then there are other who write smut and disgusting things and it never seems to stop....go figure.. sorry this happened to you alsoit usually the older people,,,go figure!seems like itMUMMY SAYS NOT 2 TALK 2 STRANGERS SORRYPunks report anything.Just Like ThatGuess yahoo likes those questions.
My friend works in yahoo and I'll ask him what they can do. I think with the new TV page, add to calendar is probably one of those features that was missed because many times software companies leave out the "small" features to squeeze in the large ones.Unfortunately, I don't believe you can.  I had the very same question myself, because I, too, used to print out a weekly listing like you did.  I checked other questions here on Yahoo Answers, and many, many people are asking the same thing and getting no answers from Yahoo.  The general consensus is that people are leaving Yahoo in droves to find better listings elsewhere and Yahoo doesn't appear to even care!. . The closest thing I've found to being like the old listings is at:. http://tvlistings.aol.com
go to tools, option-->delete history. for beta 7 internet explorer:tools->delete browser historyWhacha been searchin that you need to delete?Yahoo Search (web search):.

Must be the glint in the damn Yahoo servermaybe that is all that is allowed.15 posts in one day?  I have not had any trouble posting entries.  But sometime I do get a strange error message
Why do you ask pointless questions?Well, you dont need them. Its just to pass the time. There are better questions on this site. You just have to look in different categories.because we all doNot all questions are pointless. If you think they are so pointless, don't answer them and you won't have to worry yourself over points.You don't NEED the points. If the questions are pointless and giving answers are a waste of time, just don't do it. It's all very simple.Thought we needed points to ask questions, having gained them by answering them, no?To reach a higher level........ .   M     ; )dont answer them. oh dear I just answered your pointless questionBecause Yahoo answers has taken over the world and is now controlling your mind.. . it feels like an itch you just can't scratch so don't even fight it.just something to doIf you dont like them get off the site, why are you here anyway? just to be listened to.So you may rise through the levels and do more of what it is you are already doingAh, life - the pointlessness of it all. . .sigh. . .ITS JUST A BIT OF FUN. . .  and sometimes you help someone and sometimes you learn something you otherwise wouldn't have.
I don't know,...I think the server is down-- I am having the same issues?  Are you able to log in yet?
Click Start, go to Programs and then click on Yahoo! messenger.Sign in your Yahoo! user name and password.Add people to your contact list.Start Chatiing.Enjoy!You should be able to acces it in the start menu under all programs.
you could do the add/remove program thing but if you just want to turn it off left click anywhere on the header or next to the search bar in a blank space and just click on yahoo and that will turn it off. now the down side to that is every time you turn on your computer you may have to turn  off yahoo search bar again.go to start and into the control panel | add/remove programs |    and scroll down until near the bottom you will see the yahoo tool bar and a button to uninstall it...Go to Start, then control panel, then add or remove programs, then scroll down to the toolbar, then click remove, then click yes you want to uninstall. Follow what it says and it's gone!go to control panel then go to add/remove programs scroll down on the list until you find it then click remove or unistall...good luck
I started by going all over the site.. . I fell into polls and surveys, but there has been a strong childish streak over there I have begun to notice.  I am not in High School anymore, and do not wish to watch or be a part of those games.. . I am starting to go other places, but this site may currently be my most visited site.This catagory, followed by moviesGosh it's really a tie between this category (because I love Y!A) and 'Parenting and Pregnancy' (because I'm trying to conceive).Cleaning and Laundry.  I get mostly best answers on questions about suede and leather because I was in the business  for  years.Politics & Government > Immigration. . I visit it because it is the most controversial forum on here.Polls and Surveys, Society and Culture.All Categories..lol! Because there are wider range of options of question that I can answer, to help people out and of thing to learn, from the answers. . . Next will be Philosophy or News & Event - my interests following by Yahoo Products - share my unsophisticated knowledge with others. I make new friends from this category!..so much fun!mail duuu you got to check your mail
That's weired.  I don't know just talk monotone or something. Then they won't know your emotions.You need not change the Messenger.Changing the messenger is not going to solve the problem.. . To enable Audibles, go to the top of the main Messenger window and click on "Messenger" and then "Preferences.". . A window will appeared called "Yahoo! Messenger Preferences." Click on where it says "Messages.". . Find the area labeled "Miscellaneous" and check the box next to where it says "Enable Audibles" and where it says "Always play audio when I send or receive Audibles.". . Yahoo changed the sounds in YM8. You can replace the new sounds with the old ones.. This site explains how to replace the olds sounds.. http://www.whiskeybentandhellbound.com/.... . . Are you using window blinds or alien guise or some other window enhancement program? e.g. programs that add extra buttons like transparency and keep always on top or change the look of the windows in anyway (not including standard XP themes). if so disable it and yahoo should work...

On Internet Explorer 7 click the gold star on the left of the toolbar, or press Ctrl + i or Alt + c on your keyboard, and also if the Menu Bar with File, Edit, View, Favorites, Tools, and Help isn't showing, click Tools (an icon that looks like a gear) on the bottom right of the toolbar, a menu pops up, click Menu Bar, or right click a vacant space on the toolbar, a menu pops up, click Menu Bar. . . If you only need the Menu Bar with File, Edit, View, Favorites, Tools, and Help to appear temporarily just press the Alt key on your keyboard. This way your toolbar doesn't take up as much of your screen. If you want it to stay permanently, right click on a vacant space on the toolbar and click Menu Bar.Bottom left side of your toolbars are 2 little yellow stars. Those are now your shortcuts to Favorite. With the + sign you can add to favorites

Yahoo has to pay to list stories...they don't want to do that...so you need to open a story, scroll down to the Reuters (or other) link and click on it to go to their site for the latest news.  Just use Yahoo as a linkage site.  Also, add free news sites to your favorites list...like BBC, the Economist, Irish Times, etc.I did all the things Yahoo Help said to do, but my stuff is all old too.  My page shows the correct date, but no other current info.  No TV listings, horoscope, etc.I dont have an answer. I just want ot know how long we have to suffer, before we are updated.
If the questions have been resolved or gone into voting, they can't be removed. Only Open Questions can be removed by going to the question and scrolling over the Pencil icon.I just came back to Answers after a 4-month hiatus and I just notice that too. It seems questions from banned users are not needed and therefore are remove from your answer list.. . So is like this: No user= No question/answer.If you're talking about questions getting removed from answers, it's usually because it was offensive in nature.  Such as racist questions etc.  Also, some questions can be removed by the asker.What questions from what list?  Need more definition in order to assist you.
A little Mad?. When was the last time a cop actually helped you? Police issue tickets to make the government . money, not to help you. Police are meter maids doing nothing productive, but make your life . harder to live.

Absolutely NOTHING hahaha, it's nuts isn't it?the more points you have, the higher level you are. the higher level you are, the more questions and answers and stuff you can do here. that`s allNothing and status.2+points for an answer. 5- for asking question. 1+for showing up1 point for showing in a day.. 2 points for answering each questions.. -5 for asking each questions.. 3 points for choosing the best answer tat ppl help u to answer all the questions tat u hav askedJust to build for higher levels. They earn you more priveleges. Really nothing more than that.The points are just a way to encourage participation. They help you move up levels so that you can ask and answer more questions in a day.I have no idea but seems that some people are obsessed in getting points.
Tools > Internet Options. Clear your cookies and cache, this should solve your problem!. . Good luck.. If you need more help or better directions feel free to email me.yes go to . . tools / internet options/ content/auto complete/clear passwords and then clear forms
The answer is NO. There are programmes used by people sending spam that will tell them whether your address is genuine because you have opened it. Do not open any spam messages or you'll have many more.. Otherwise it works like slow-mail. if you want to know that the other person has received your message you need the other to confirm.. Hope is not old-fashioned unresponded love e-mails ;)there is no way of knowing if your mail has got received or not. this happens only with e greetings where the sender is informed when his/her greeting has been viewed. u will just have to wait for response from the other end to know if mail has reached or not.. if the address u have typed & receiver's in box is free then usually mail would be delivered otherwise u will get amail failure notification from yahoo.
Just omissions! you'll notice that a few Q's are not answered for some time by friends on this net!Perhaps no one has relevant knowledge, skill or experience to reflect on your questions. Please do not be upset. Create questions that are not 100% technical. Maybe that can invite some answers.You don`t ask them when your technical help is online.Your questions (and answers) do not seem to be straightforward.Why are you really posting stuff like that?

If you check your recent activity it will list the last six sets of points that you receive (best answers, answering questions, asking questions, voting for best answers, logging in).  When you log in you see the new points on the recent activity that you didn't receive while you weren't on the site.  You would have received sixty or seventy points, it's just that you wouldn't have seen that you were credited for all of them.the troll stole your other 40 pointsYahoo is dogging us on points, cuz this morning I had 8 best answers, and only got 42 points....and Ive had no violations, nor have I asked any questions.Maybe Yahoo deducted points for questions that didn't meet TOS & were deleted. Happens a lot.

They will stay in there until you decide to send them to Trash.retrieve from where? if you trashed them in yahoo mail..then they are gone...you cannot retrieve them because they were on yahoo's email server (computer) and not your computer. . if they are in your INBOX..click on sender and it will group all email from one person in ABC orderIf you mean FIND emails from a certain person, then do a search in the box in your email by the name of the person and all of the mails sent and recieved with the persons name in it will display (if you have not deleted any).
Wow,  are they mostly spam?  if so make sure you have your spam filter turned in your mail options.  This will direct most if it to a bulk folder that you can empty, let Yahoo empty or auto empty.. . You might also try the "select all" at the bottom of your inbox.set up a rules wizard to transfer all emails containing a word to deleted items then refresh.
attach it in a doc, drag the photo to ur desktop and when u go to attach it, click on desktop and that photo, this works for MAC computers mostly though1.Compose .. 2.Use attach files option.. 3.Then browse for pictures files you want to add then click upload.. 4.Wait until uploaded .. 5.Continue compose. 6.Send e-mail
Who are you talking to mate? Lay off the drugs! Your paranoid!exactly!  amen.  "they" are definitely morons.  i found this out and i am floored.  i need to know how to change this.  i do not want my name on here for anyone to see.  doesnt this violate yahoo's privacy policy?  or violate my privacy?I totally agree with you.. . I'm having the same problem.. . If you can sign in Stealth, then why is so hard to use an on line name instead of your real name?. . Take Care
I totally agree...all this new format is is an excuse to put in a million ads.I`m totally lost. I have TV on MY YAHOO and it never has changed. So there`s nothing new.Lots of people are solving the problem by going elsewhere. Zap2It is one I am seeing a lot. I went to AOL, and actually they pull from Zap2It.. I left TVguide's website a few years back because they did this exact same thing. (Cumbersome, slow, ad filled, useless interface)
Tools > Internet Options > Content > AutoComplete > Clear Forms. This will clear out ALL your autocompleted forms, such as search windows, form fill-ins, etc. You can also reset your Auto-Complete options here.. . Or, to delete just a single (or a few) searches, just have them highlighted in the drop-down list and hit DELETE -- they will vanish! If you hold down the key, the whole drop-down list of searches will delete.. . If you are using the Yahoo! Toolbar, I believe there is a drop-down box at the end of the search window that has the option to CLEAR SEARCHES on it.. . Clearing your history only clears out the PAGE locations that you have recently visited.This is not what they are talking about.  I get it to and i am sick of it.  I go straight to google, even thought my school earns money using ggod search which is powwered by yahoo.. . What happened on safari or IE.  you enter a search word or phrase, you get several hits, you select one to look at and instead of taking you there, you get sent to yahoo's advanced search page.. . When I searched for this question (ON GOOGLE) I found a link to this forum. Google brought me here but yahoo kept taking me back to the advanced search page when ever I would enter anything in a search box.FIrst you need to tell us EXACTLY what happens when you search, and what search engine you use to search. Also tell us what browser you're using (internet explorer for example).. . Look for any suspicious looking programs on the running processes, and tell us those as well.
Why is Yahoo! referring you to AT&T?!?!  Yahoo! needs to take responsibility for their content...by law, if they know about content that is inappropriate, they have to get rid of it.  They even had a court ruling over this, I believe, and this was the verdict.I'm surprised they are even answering. They never respond to me at all. . Don;t you find it ironic that Yahoo! Answers has no answers for you?Sounds about right.  Yahoo is a joke when it comes to customer service.  It's usually because they have no idea what to do themselves.. . I'm surprised they haven't told you to uninstall and re install something yet.
You would have received 80 points, but you wouldn't have seen that you were credited for all of them.  If you look at your MyQ&A page, and look at Activity Details, you will see that it only lists the last six actions your account has had. If you had looked at your activity when you received your points, it probably credited you for four best answers, and either a point for logging in and a point for a best answer thumbs up, or two points for best answers thumbs up.The best thing to do is to contact Yahoo directly. Did you visibly see all your 8 Best Answers. Because sometimes there is a glitch in their system and they count each Best Answer twice. Once that happened to me when I had 3 but they told me I had 6. I still only got 30 points.Maybe your best answer was tied with someone else's so you had to split the 10 points between you.maybe because ... . of the people who are rating your answers as bad rating..
right click on search and delete them..                      OR. If you're using Internet Explorer, follow these steps:. . 1.

Not sure how to. Still trying to figure that out.You have to have yahoo mail plus.  If you do, than go to options, pop forwarding and follow directionsYou can't. Free email services only work through a browser, not an email program. That way the free services can intercept all the email addresses that you use and sell them to spammers.
Right click the folder and choose delete from the resulting shortcut menu.Above inbox click edit. Go to folder you want deleted and delete.
.Use insert picture, from file. you may need o be in html mode for this to work in outlookJust answered similar question---in case you missed it---In Yahoo, the only way that I know of is copy and paste OR drag and drop.. . In Outlook Express, it's as simple as clicking a blank space in message body, then clicking on insert tab, then on pictures, --select picture, click ok, and it's done.
Unfortunately, your adress may have been sold by someone you did business with on the internet (always check privacy policies before you give out personal information).  Or a more likely, your email adress was in an email that ended up in a computer that had been infected with a program that harvested email adresses, and sent them back to the spammer.  I know that's what generated most of my spam.  This is why anti-virus programs, firewalls and programs like Spybot-Search & Destroy are so important, to keep your computer clean.They buy the lists from companies you might have given your e-mail address to.   Some on-line merchants sell their customer lists to other companies.   Nasty, but it happens.
yeah get rid of it and go back to EI6,the new one has to many bugs.try to check your internet sever. my yahoo messenger7.5 also like that.go to messenger.yahoo.com and install 8.
not sure if you have that pencil by the big red Y! on your toolbar but if you do then you click on that pencil and the first one that says toolbar options that where your added tabs isI dont know , but I am advicing you to use another browser like Opera or Firefox, it has tabs , and more staible than winsows explorer. and they are free. . good luck

that have a little problem darling.Beta sucks.  Wait for 6 months til they work the bugs out.
sorry, you can't.  You can however, open a new folder, with any name you want through your yahoo mail.  sent, received or any mail can be moved to that folder, you can choose to hide folders if needed too.  Hope that helpsTry resending it to yourself from trash and then resend it to another(of yours) address.Like a different account. Most people have yahoo/outlook express or aol/yahoo. Hope this helped. It works for me.
I would agree with jackie, depends on what email you are using. It sounds to me like you are sending it from a work email or something, if you are, then they may be blocking you from sending them. The problem is not with the actual sending but with the account itself not allowing you too.Be more precise as to which email program you are using. That may have something to do with it, or the way you have downloaded the pics, also. If you have imbedded them into a file...or more than 1 file, you may have to drag the pics out onto your desktop & try to send them from there. Let me know if this helps....

Subpoenas to an email address? I would assume  you would be looking for a snail mail address.I can't imagine any reason why you would want to send a subpoena to Yahoo!   You will need a physical address and a name to go with it.  Good luck.
I haven't been able to connect in 6 days now.  Yahoo Customer Care promises a reply to help requests within 24 hours and I haven't heard one word from them in 6 days either after emailing them the first day of the problem.  Way to go Yahoo.  Excellent customer support as always.I am not having any problems. Just keep trying.You could consider uninstall your current Yahoo! Messenger and download from http://www.filehippo.com/download_yahoo_messenger/.  The latest version is Yahoo! Messenger 8.1.0.195.  You could also find a list of previous versions of Yahoo! Messenger on the right panel.
You are on Yahoo.Sign in. Yahoo Answers is Yahoo. Here`s a link for all Yahoo.
Try going to Messenger and then to My Contact Details and change your info there. That may change what other people see.You don't.  They see whatever they have you saved as in their address book.  You can change what you see on your screen by saving yourself in your address book, but it won't change what others see.
The only way is if you know the password to access the account and not all accounts will archive messages. It depends on whether they have it set to or not. It does not save it in a folder on your hardrive that I am aware of sorry.On the main messenger window, click on 'Contacts' on the menu bar, then scroll down to 'Message Archive' and click on that. They will be organized by your contacts names.I know some messengers allow you to view saved converstions, however, the key word there is saved. When you close a conversation, normally you have the option to save or not, and if they didn't save, then there is no real way of finding out what they said. Sorry, but if they did save the conversation, then you could look in the meesengers folder in your harddrive, and find them there.

they are here only for point gaming despite it being prohibited.People who are miserable failures in all other aspects of life seem to like accumulating points here. It gives meaning to their otherwise pathetic existence.I just want to reach 100,000 points because I will be on the leader board and I will feel proud that I accomplished this mission.
Your question said (multiple users)..Yahoo is picking up a cookie of another user on the computer when you see a different password listed. If there are more than one user of yahoo on same computer all of you should sign out when closing yahoo.. "security"this sounds wearied unless if you haven't check the box says save password. May be you are logging off windows yahoo without logging out yahoo and it's possible that there might be a glitch that windows closes b4 yahoo. . Do this, reinstall yahoo, login and make sure to save password box is checked, exit yahoo, then start yahoo again. If this one works, then exit yahoo AND THEN log off windows and see if it works. If this one doesn't work, then u might have some issues w windows.it doesnt remember because it doesnt want anybody else to log onto you accont....it does the same for me...but i llike it better then having someone get on mine and pretend they are me and get me into trouble!!!!

Just below the "answer this question" button, go to the + symbol, and select "add to my watch list" from the menu that appears. Ideally, you add any question that you want to keep an eye on, but do not have an answer for.. . Additional - I think the problem you're describing is with the site itself, so no, unless I am mistaken, unless Yahoo corrects it, it can't be fixed. Could be wrong about that, though.HI, Under the blue "Answer the Question" bar is another bar with the thumbs up and thumbs down choices.  To the far right of those a cross.  Place your curser on that cross and you will see a drop down list.  Add to watch list is on that drop down.  I hope this helps you.  Good Luck!okk at the symbols under the question giving rating email to friend There is a cross and when you place cursor over it the add to watch list appears

So what you do it get yahoo messenger and stay signed in and when you get a new message an envelope will pop on your tool bar..... . Hope this helps
I don't know but I was looking to see if anyone else was having the same problem. I like to just vote sometimes and it's almost impossible because there are more resolved answers in the undecided catagory than anything else.Dude, all that bovine fecal matter is messed up.  Even though you clicked on some, did the response come up: That question has been deleted.! . What?!?!?! How?!?!?. . /doc
Right click on any GIF (moving picture) you find on the web and "Save as".

Im ok with it. But it WOULD be nice if ppl would just pick a best answer.it doesn't bother meI feel happy because then I get to vote on my answer, and if no one else votes I get 10 points for best answer.
first you need to press the forward button, this will open up the email ready to press the send button, then you can edit the text, delete parts etc, then you can send it. . you can not edit an email that has been sent to you until you forward it on to someone or reply.Press the Forward button and they just edit whatever you want to edit.hey, just press the foward icon and then edit what you want to,foward it then,however you have to be very careful so you don't delete any important part of the message, especially if you have any attached files yo the message.Copy the whole thing, Click the forward button, Paste the original and delete what you don't want forwarded. NOTE: make sure the e-mail does not say that a file is attached. This means the original is attached separeately, but in full original context. If htis is too complicated, just Copy original and paste onto a new e-mail, click on your address book and click on the people you want to send to. Luck!!!Elementary Jennie. Click on the forward icon. A new window opens. In this window U can edit what ever U want and then send it to who ever U want. U can delete different parts for different people similarly and forward to different people separately
You can forward them to the new account.I always send my emails I receive to myself several times to make sure I actually did receive them.Click on forward type in your other account. click send.how do i send a email?
I'm with you on that!  It's a pain in the butt to get to one of the areas of yahoo that I'm on the most!I wondered the same thing!  Now it's hidden in a window you have to click for stuff that's not listed. You'd think it'd be right up front!
so wat would b the point of asking!?. if u knew the answer no need for this site!then what would be the point of yahoo answers.it's for people who want help or an another view on somethingBecause it would make no sense.Because if you knew the answer you wouldn't ask, now would you!so, why did you tell us. we sure can't answer our own question.Umm... wat wud be the point?. is  for ppl to answer your questions. if u want to answer ur question. why bother asking a question!. u cud have 2 ids.. and pretend to be someone else!. lolSometimes the question has "NO MEANINGS".Otherwise it may be someone's question.Because you are entitled to choose the best answer which gets 10 points. So you understand.. you can very well supplement with whatever you know while choosing the best answerwhats the point!! if u know the answer.. there's hardly the need to even put up the question.... doh!?! and if you want to add your remarks, you always can!!I'm sure you can answer your own questions. And if you don't know the answer you go to research. And if you can't find the answer you may ask some others.. I think we are constantly asking ourselves questions... and answering them. That helps us to create our personality and define what do we like or not.. The problem is that not always the answers are correct... Sometimes we answer ourselves thinking in what could give us more pleasure in the short term.. . -- Before asking someone else... we always make the question first to ourselves.If we want to answer ur own question why would u ask the question and simply waste 5 points.Moreover u cannot answer or rate ur answerwe know the things that we have to know in our own environment and situation - but there are so many different environments and situations that nobody can have the answers for everything that goes on in the world.. so you turn to somebody who is anspecialized in his situation and he turns to you for your specialazationIf you know answer to the question.What is the use to ask a question and getting answers that you already known.First see your own face without using a mirrorIf you know the answer, then why to ask.At the first place why you want to ask then? Only ypu will like to answer your own question if you want to earn points or you are not sure whether anybody will answer your question. BTW, you have lost some good points by asking this question but many others have earned points by replying to this question.. . Ha ha ha!!! Keep asking such silly questions.
Because HappyThanksgiving is not a question,this website is for asking,answering,and discovering questions.Happy Thanksgiving does not fall into any of those catagoriesBecause it was a statement but not a question - try posting it on Yahoo Statements instead of Answers next timepossibly because it wasn't a questionI'm not sure, but Happy Thanksgiving to you too!!Some people are just not in the holiday spirit. But, I will wish you a happy Thanksgiving.probably because it wasnt a questionBecause some people are Anti-American and to think their call themselves Americans.Because you tried to post a statement as a question. . This is not a bulletin board.It is considered "chatting". . I think it is unfair to remove the more venial offenses like chatting when the rude stuff lasts way too long.. . I answered a question about a TV show and when picked as best the asker commented on my answer and it was yanked.. It was weird coz I got the your answer was picked email and when I go to check it gave the 'this Q has been deleted...' page.. . Just gotta put up with it.  Not all speeders get tickets and not al "bad content" gets pulled quick enough.I think I answered it to. Someone reported it - that's whyI guess because it's not a question, but next time you can say......did everyone have a happy thanksgiving?. Oh, and happy thanksgiving to you also  :)cause yahoo is retarded. and happy thanksgiving is not a question.
You should probably just go into Hotmail and copy the email address of the person, then open Messenger and click the add button, paste the email in.if you mean the YAHOO messenger you need to download the messenger that allows msn. that person can get msn and you can go on yahoo and talk to each other! after that you click on the smilly face and add the adress! simple.
View your question. Hover your cursor over the plus sign. Click on the option to Add details. Follow the instructions provided.when you view your answer there is a wee EDIT thingy below . Cllick on that and add extra information.
It's just Yahoo's way of flagging them for your attention, the questions need to be either resolved or have their answering period extended.It's to grab your attention to remind you that you should go and look at them to choose a best answer.They are highlighted because soon you are going to have to pick a best answer for them before they go into voting. Just kind of a 'heads up' kind of thing from Yahoo! . :)
do this......... click tools,internet options,security tab, custom level,scroll down. till you see("navigate sub-frames across different domains"), click enable, click apply,click ok, exit. try to attach again, vote for me as best answerMake sure you download it first so it's in your computer. Then go back to messege and it should show attachment.try this.... go to 'Tools" - click "Internet Options", click on the "security tab", then click on the "custom level", then scroll down and choose - "Navigate-sub frames accross different domains" - and select "enable" then click "apply" or "OK". It should be working now. Try it out and see if it works.. Hope this helps!!!maybe the time you save pictures you programmed it in different size...because it has a choices either JPEG or something.  I'm not just familiar with these technical terms but it is important in storing data especially pictures.

Answering a question with a picture is a functionality that is not yet currently available. Two possible reasons are the type of programming language required and the possible distractions from the simple question and answer format.No, there's no way to include a picture in answer, other than to inlude alink to a website where the picture is posted, and directing people to that website.it depends lol if you gona add it in your exam answer or something else
Delete from where? If you need to delete from your own system go to Tools > Internet Options > Delete History/Browsing History on your toolbar. Otherwise make sure you have an effective anti-spy feature installed and update & scan regularly.To clear the yahoo search bar, go to the pencil near the search bar and a drop down box appears.. you will see clear history. that will clear everything.Yahoo Search (web search):. In Internet Explorer, go to Tools > Internet Options >Click the "Content" tab > Click "Autocomplete" > Click "Clear forms" (or, you can uncheck the box near "Forms," so your search history isn't saved automatically.

Yea to make room for the new featured question which is a pain in the rear cos i hate the new updated version of yahoo answers why could'nt they leave a good thing alone but no some genious (not) decided they needed a change it was fine before they ruined it!!! I hate the new homepage too you dont need all that extra stuff all you need is questions and answers why'd they have to ruin itMaybe you need to see an optician, but I do find staring at the screen for too long can make your eyes a bit tired.I haven't noticed but A COMPUTER SCREEN CAN GET 2 U!!Hmm... I didn't notice that but now you mention it. It's a conspiracy!!!Um, they look the same to me, sis.....i think ur right .......they do seem to have gotten smallerim sure they are smaller, dont know why . xxxxxlol its the pics getting smaller
u have a gr8 name but if u really want to change it on ur messenger then do it (if ur really desprate)for msn messenger it's under tools and then options (if you're signed in)..you type in what you what your name to beclick messanger then prefferences then nick name. but a faster way to do this is if your in a chatroom at the top right it says chat click that and go to change nick name once you have changed the nick name it will be changed on the way people see you in chatrooms and in im's but your screen name will still be the same as you set it up to be :)go to your account and edit
right click on the bar and check right sign on yahoo tool bar . if it didnt work then reinstall yahoo toolbar. if it didnt work . then try to fix ur internet explorer by a program called winASOIf you have the toolbar installed in your system, you can:. . 1) Right-click your mouse where the toolbars usually are (top of your web browser).. 2) Select "Yahoo! Toolbar" from the shortcut menu. It is going to display from then on.. . If you use a web browser other than Internet Explorer, you will not be able to use the Yahoo! Toolbar. Sorry, but it is true and is not something I invented. That's the way it goes.. . Good luck.

Just click start...programs.....accessories....system tools....system restore. . Then restore your pc to an earlier date, before you installed the newer version of internet explorer.. Try that before you you do anything.you can't.    the updates reconfigure your whole windows installation.   windows uses explorer to basically treat your own computer as an internet site.  any updated to IE updates the whole system.    your best bet is to try an older version of moxilla firefox.
Next to the "forward" button is an arrow, click for the drop down box, it will say "forward as inline text" or "forward as attachment"  always forward as "inline text" regardless if it is an attachment to you, then you can hi-lite and delete.  Sometime you have to do hi-lite and delete just a few names at a time or put your curser before the names you want deleted and hit the delete button that way, time consuming but works.Hmmmm. Really? It works for me. Otherwise you'll have to copy & paste the text you want into a new message.Open Internet Explorer. At the top, Click the Tools icon, Scroll down to the Internet Options.On the General tab. Delete History, Delete Cookies, Delete Temporary Internet files. Then click on the Contents Tab. Go to auto Complete.Then Clear Forms, Clear Passwords. Everything about your Internet session is GONE.. . Note, This is IE6

I don't know why your question was removed. . A good book to read for helping you find happiness, keep happiness, and thrive with happiness is "Feelings Buried Alive Never Die" written by Karol K. Truman.. Good luck!Yahoo can remove any questions and answers that are against their community guidelines. To see community guidelines, click the link below.. http://answers.yahoo.com/info/community_guidelines.phpI don't know, but I'll tell you one thing, they are not fair, because the questions and answers on this site that I have witnessed to be vulgar are indeed that, it's just amazing they leave them on, and I have seen swearing and younger children on here, all against community guidelines, but for some strange reason, they get by.  I don't know how to answer your question, because there isn't any rhyme or reason.  You know what I am talking about, it's amazing some of the things that get on here.hard telling - I've had several removed
I've noticed that getting results out of a search engine can take a bit of skill.  They either don't have that skill or they're sidestepping their own responsibility to seek.  So they say, "Give it to me."  There's increasing concern about overindulged kids, with parents arguing with college professors and even getting involved with job interviewers.  You may be seeing that spill over here.Absolutely, positively TRUE.  Just Google it, even if it's a sentence.  I always get an answer.. . But why do I keep answering?!  It's the POINTS.  It's like MONEY!  But it's WORTHLESS!More than action, they need interaction and a reaction. Of course, for some people it's as simple as getting attention.  They don't get that when they "google" something.using yahoo answers can get you an opinion instead of a fact. i use it mainly for polls.I think it is because they like the idea of having someone live respond to them.  So many can be answered with a simple search, so I am a bit baffled myself.  . A lot of the askers strike me as rather young, perhaps that has something to do with it too?They are lazy.  Too lazy to do their own research.  Therefore they get perfect strangers to do it.i think so they can get a younger persons point of view, and so they get more varied answers instead of just one big onemaybe it seems more reliable from a person
You don't.  Your account information is kept secure for your protection.Is that even possible? I didn't think it was because if you can get at it without signing in then any Joe Schmo could get at it and use it to their advantage.You can't... that is why you have a username and password so you can have an account.there is probably a option to have it emailed to your secondary account
Because there are still people who believe in the proper way to do & say things.. Improper grammer is hard on the ears and makes you sound uneducated.its not fair we have to answer politely it will encourage him to gain more and more knowledge if u point finger to them it will hurt their ego, so they will stop leaningBecause, small child, it IS important to express yourself correctly and I reserve my right to tell you you have terrible grammar if, indeed, you do.because YOUR  grammer is terribleSome of these people only come on here to find fault with someone or,upset them all in the name of points.. In a way they are saying if you are Dyslexic or have problems with spelling and grammar you should not be on here.. There are a lot of very well known businessmen and Celebrities who are Dyslexic and have done very well,and because you can not spell etc some idiots think you are stupid,this is not the case.. You have raised a good point.They like feeling superior.because they canfor the hell of it.... for the 2 points..... to be funnycos they are better than usBecause they like to think they are smarter than the average person..............and its an easy 2 point without having to think...............need I say anymore??
IP means Internet Protocol.

it stays on voting as long as no answer as the most number of votesI guess it stays on for a long time, but eventually it will probably be cleared off. I haven't seen any official statement about this  --   yet.. It does say that 5 points are returned if nobody votes for best answer, so there must be a time limit somewhere.pretty much you can always click on the discover tab and your most likely going to find along with the thousands of undecided questionsIt will stay in voting until someone does vote for a best answer (or no best answer).  Yahoo! checks for tie breakers every 12 hours, so a question can get resolved within 12 hours of one single vote.No, it does drop off and points get returnedprobably.  it's yahoo answers after allIf no votes are received for any answer the question moves into the Tiebreaker vote. Any vote for a BA will immediately Resolve the question.I don't know. I'm answering this to see the answers.
block specific addresses. options address blocker.Bulk Folder is Spam only. Tht is where it goes. I have provided a link to look at for your answer. Take CareI have been trying to stop it for 6 months and have gotten no were, what I do is just click on empty
Basically, you can't. At least not with your everyday email client. There are certain anti-spam software packages that let you "bounce" email, but you're not gonna' be able to do this in Yahoo! mail, for instance.cannot be!!! you will really open it before you decide to send it back.Why would you want to return an unopened email?  Because you no longer wish that person to send stuff to you?  If so just block that address.You can't, you have to open mail for returning back to the sender
In the FAQ it says that questions are removed after a set period of time if not resolved...unfortunately it does not happen!  If you serarch by number of answers in reverse (so you get least answers first) some of those have lots of answers and are resolved but still show on the index as having no answers...crazy!...;I think you can get extensions on the closing date of your question.Yahoo hasn't cleared them out yet.yahoo needs to clean up their act.
click on the advanced  link next to the search bar and search by user nicknameClick on their avatar, (there picture)...and itll take you to their profile.

They would do it even if there were no points on offer, but at least having points means that they can often be weeded out before they get to a high enough level to really cause trouble (Unlike the tiger323/samuel person who seems immune to reporting)Exactly, why bother? Apparentely you do, but I don't see the point in that. No pun intended.I agree, why cheat cheat on thisTrue.  If Y Answers if ever to be any real use then get rid of the points systemJust ignore the losers not really interested in the points I like getting the e-mail to say someone has chosen my answer and it has helped, let the cheating scumbags have the points always somebody around who will try to stuff things up it's a sad fact of life.

They got mine too, the bastards - is this some secret goverment plot in human cloning? Should we be looking over our shoulders - will we even HAVE any shoulders this time tomorrow?. Dark days that we're living in, don't you think?Maybe if it was facing to the left it would show a more realistic side of you?i also prefer the smiley face to this guy sillhouette.This looks like a postage stamp!I disliked the new grey silhouette so much I went back to my Yahoo Avator.Oh no....this one is ugly and I don't like it too.male and female have the same mug shotAnd the round smiley face did???!!!!!. . Dont be lazy and do an avatar!!yahoo like to play around every so ofteni dont know you should just make an avatar.I guess Yahoo must have changed it...sorry to hear that you don't like it but you could easily draw one on paint program in computer and upload it.Hi!. . I agree,  I hardly recognised you!!Pardon me. Do you mean your avatars? You can check that your "grey-smiley-face" are uploaded with correctly. Do once again just to make sure.maybe if you turn a little bit more to the left it (the grey silhouette) wil somehow resemble youYou turned around.Did the gray smiley look like you? :) Lovely Yahoo! always changing...I'm not too fond of the new mail beta.Isn't the grey sihouette to do with the Yahoo! 360 account? Have you just created one and your preferences here have changed to show your 360 profile instead? I might be wrong..... Go to edit your profile and check the 360 account is not selected. If you choose just display no image you should have your grey smiley face back..... I think......Yeah, I believe that you do but I just kept getting you mixed up with lots of other people on here !!! You could choose an avatar or post a picture!?! . I suppose it is all in the name of  progress!!!
Yahoo is not giving cash prizes, it is a scam.I think its a scam... Try to email the yahoo support team...We get this question every few days.  It's a SCAM.  Yahoo is not in the Lottery Business.I've seen a posting about this before.  You're not the first.  Whenever I am suspicious about any e-mail, I go to www.snopes.com.  It is a website dedicated to exposing urban legends, hoax e-mails, and scams.  It is a great resource--it does all the research for you and even sometimes tells you when and where the e-mails first appeared.Send a email to it and see if it comes back invalid.. . Say Hi, My names jogn Doe blah blah blah
Points encourage participation. The more points you have, the more questions you can ask and answer.You get points for visiting the site, answering questions, voting for best answers, choosing a best answer for your own question, having your own question voted as best answer.. . Points are so people can see how involved you are in yahoo questions, see your "best answer percentage" to see how good your answers are.  The number of points you have determines how many times you can vote, ask, answer, rate and comment in a day.. . When you ask a question you spend points on it.  This point system encourages people to vote, rate, choose best answers, give good answers by rewarding people with privileges if they have many points and penalizing them by not awarding privileges  if they have few points.. . For details check out the "Points and Levels" page: http://answers.yahoo.com/info/scoring_system.phpGood Question!. Sorry I had to say that, I could've just voted but I DON'T HAVE ENOUGH POINTS YET!!You get points because the Yahoo garden gnomes like to pass them out. When you get a lot, the gnomes come to your house and redecorate it.
I'm no software expert, but I don't think you can access Outlook Express from Yahoo Mail. As for getting Outlook Express to forward your e-mails to Yahoo, you might try going into *tools* and then into *message rules* and checking the box that selects mail fowarding and see if that works.how to convert yahoo mail to Outlook express
See an M.D. Pooky, it could kill you.Go to an exorcistThis is what happened when I had phenomena. First I had a cold with a bad cough. Then it got better. Then, suddenly, after a couple of days, it was worse again. I wouldn't have even gone to the doctor except that I'm fussy about my ears - I thought she was going to say, "Go back to work, you big baby, you have a cold!" but what she said instead was, "If you don't go home and go to bed, you're going to be in the hospital." She told me they're always very interested if you get better and then worse. If I had any suspicions at all I'd go straight to the doctor.I would know if i had pneumonia. i've had it one time and i sure knew i  had it when i couldn't breath and coughing up blood. yuk.contact your doctor or go to hospital straight away. phenmonia can kill.you're going to have to go to the dr to find out.  if they can hear fluid in your lungs then you've got it.  you may have trouble breathing and sleeping lying down....much more comfortable if your head is elevated somewhat....go to the dr if u think that u have it so it doesn't get worse.My brother just got that he said he had pains in his upper stomach and it hurt like heck!! he started coughing alot .do you mean pneumonia?. fluish symptoms, horrible productive cough (stuff spews out when you cough), chest pain, difficulty breathing, feeling like cr*p. when in doubt, see your doctor, pneumonia can be deadlyDo you mean pneumonia? Cough, fever, shortness of breath, and pleuritic chest pain are the most common symptoms, but are seldom ALL present. A doctor can do an exam and perhaps a chest x-ray. Go. Now. If you do indeed have pneumonia, early treatment has a huge impact on outcome.Do you mean pneumonia??? You go to the Dr. If you dont mean pneumonia.. I have no idea what that is and can be of very little help.Do you mean pneumonia? The symptoms are, but are not limited to chest pain and shortness of breath..see your doctor right away if you feel you have it, because it could be serious.What the hell is Phenmonia?
Was your other account a PAID yahoo account.  On FREE yahoo, you are not paying for their services, so they have advertising to pay for their expenses.  That is the only reason I can think of.Hi,. It is part of the new format.  Yahoo mail is making a lot of changes and I guess they need to pay for them via ads.. Hope this helps you.
there's no view profile on new yahoo messanger if that's what you meant, unless you view someone profile on your list ,it's false when there's no contact clicked , just click any contact then click view profile,. . to view other people profile's they aren't on your list. just put there ID'S after the link. . www.profiles.yahoo.com/ the id here. and put in your internet browser address bar,thats easy. If your talking to them in messenger just click on the word actions at the top of the box. At the top of that list it will say contact options; Click on that & it will bring another list up if you look at that list it will see view profile so click on that & it will come up for you to view.

It gets old pretty quickly if there's not a new slant on the old Dem vs Rep push-pull. Nothing is really gained to just name-call the other person. I find that REALLY boring and a waste of time.People are reporting the questions.censorship of the intollerant bigots is divine justice -- has nothing to do with yahoo.  more like yaweh.It must be somebody has reported it as abusal or against the rule.i suggest resubmitting the question and omitting the last word as in stupid.if liberals are stupid are conservatives?Yahoo in and of itself doesn't remove the questions.  People using the site report them, and if there's enough reports they remove them.
I'll wait to see some other answers, trying to do same thing.click on start, go to all programs, find yahoo messenger, and from there you should find an uninstall tab. click on that and it should go away
i don't know what problem you are incurring with. just search for the pic once again and try again to select it as the backgroundlook   your   manu  and  there   is  a   photo  in    meanu     cick  brous    and   set
after you attach the file near the file in the messenger there will be a delete button click itUnfortunately the only way is to delete the message that the photo/attachment is attached to.. . I have suggested to Yahoo! in their surveys that they provide the option of "stripping" attachments from a message, but they haven't implemented it.

do you have a yahoo account?  are they in the trash? once they are gone, that's it.  Maybe you should get a backup account and forrward important email to it :)If you have a Yahoo account and you delete your e-mails that's it. You missing some important messages, you didn't receive them? What you mean you are without your e-mails over a month? I don't get it.
Do you have wi fi? If so, you need to call your router company and they will help you with your access point, etc.  And you also need to close all the dns error pages before you click IE again.I think you have the same virus that I had,. "Double Click"     Reformat.Go and get Firefox, it's far superior to IE. If you haven't typed the URL correctly you won't find the page or it may have been withdrawn. I could also be due to the relevent server being down at the time.

Open the attachment and choose the program like word or whatever you are using. Click print.I'm not sure what you mean, it's inside your mail, like you sent it to yourself or someone sent it to you?  If it's a file attachment, download it and then print it.  If it's right inside your mail where you write a message, you can cut and paste it to your word or works program and then print from there or you can highlight your resume, click print, then print selected, and print it that way.
you dontYeah, you can't.  I have tried because I wanted to go to an old question I asked or answered, but there were to many pages. If you put them on your watch list they can be deleted, but your Q&A's can not.  Maybe it is because if someone views a response by you they can look and see if you are legitimate or not.Unforunately you don't . I have about 35 pages of answers I have to go through if I want to see the answers. I did make a suggestion in the yahoo blogs that something needs to be fixed so we can delete them. Maybe if more people go on there and say the same thing, yahoo will come up with something.

unworthy of what? your life,,things in general,,family,,,,,maybe you need a change in jobs or a vacation of sorts . you need to talk to someone if you think its a serious problem...I'm sorry I'm not qualified to council you or i would do my best to help you.suround urself with people who love uIf it is serious, you need counseling.  Otherwise, start taking care of yourself by eating right, exercising and taking up some classes to improve your overall status.  Then, you will definitely feel much better about yourself.Unfortunately, you and many others do. Unfashionable as it is in this day and age to believe in spiritual awakening (which has never gone out of fashion) it is the only certain cure. After all, it has been the way for multitudes of people for multitudes of years. Many people, myself included( I was an avowed atheist for many years) dismissed this wonderful healing which is available for every conceivable problem. I now know with absolute certainty that it does work. You simply have to try it. . You simply pray or converse with your own inner being or highest Self asking for help and for guidance. And, if not immediately, the answer WILL surely come in one way or another. Then you will feel a burden lifted from you and you will experience a tremendous gratitude and hope and a new relish for life. THIS IS THE TRUTH. Please try to get "The Game Of Life and How to It" by Florence Scovill Shinn. It's an older book and has been reprinted countless times. Many, many people have been helped by this wonderful book. As title says life is really a game (a joyful game!) not a battle as many people experience it. She shows you how to learn the game.and how to play it. I wish you well.

But you can delete all the content so it's just a shell with no information.. . Is this what you mean?
u can do it by . on messenger<preferences<alerts and soundsyou can, by clicking messenger which is found on top then preferences or you can press Ctrl + Shift + P then click Calling & Audio and you can handle it from there

See this:. . http://geocities.com/alqa_21/yahelite.html. . AFTER POST – in regard to KEVIN’s answer below.. . That’s simple! Yahoo has over 30 world location and number (hundreds) of different servers. Some experience some problems while some don’t. Depending where you located and what program are you using you may be able to log in or not:. . http://world.yahoo.com/Do you have Yahoo Messenger with voice? I log-in everyday without any problems. Unless the site is having problems, but if they are having problems a pop-up window will let you know...Try again but if it still does not work the second time, some files might have gotten corrupt, just uninstall and then reinstall that should solve the problem..You are not the only one having problems. You should see how many people are having trouble including me. I even uninstalled the software and reinstalled it and it hasn't work. My has been down since yesterday afternoon and that is what time it looks like others had their problems.
Use hotmail.com or yahoo.com. I would suggest yahoo. all you do is go to sign up, and it will prompt you what to do. Make sure you are not signed in though.Sign out of your own Yahoo ID and Register for a new account for your son.  Be aware that each of you will have to sign out and sign in if you are sharing a computer and both using Yahoo.  http://www.yahoo.com/. . Hope that helps!the real q. is how old is your son?.              q: does he have a computer that is on the net?.              q. can he make his one email address?. . then all the other answers will work just fine.... . if he is nit old enough then you will need to make one for him... if he does not have a computer then you will need th share with him... if he does not live with you then my friend you are in truble....Since you have Yahoo, set up one for him in the same manner that you did, add your email address as a contact, and you're ready to go. Make sure he knows how to change the password.just go to yahoo cik on the then sign in with the name yur son wants then it will say not an existing user clik new  user then u fell out the form and he gots an email your welcome man

If you have a yahoo messanger, go up to the top and click "messanger" you'll see a list of options, one of them being "my account info", once your in there, scroll down to "Address/Contact Information" and click "edit" on the right. you should be able to change your name.I think the only way to change your user name is to just simply make a new profile.  It may be a pain in the a$$, but, if there's some sort of loophole I don't know about, I personally don't think there is a way
I love my 360 and the friends that are made if you chat and choose wisely. Very entertaining social scene.I no like account.  Me hungry for apple instead.
IIf you are seeing the name in the lower right corner, more then likely you added the user's alias name (you can have up to 6 on one account) and you are seeing their Main Yahoo! ID  as they log in.  This has been  a Messenger glitch for years.That's strange. I've never had that happen.
Possible explanations:. 1) Everyone's opinions are different, some people might think a question is bad. 2) as the person above mentioned, there are trolls that go around giving everyone a thumbs down. 3) some people have made enemies on here, who will follow them and gives a thumbs down or report them for everythingno matter where you go you'll find immature people who like to give thumbs downs because they can. or the people who don't like people so they give them thumbs downs. it's lame ...... For example your question which was an honest concern gets a thumbs down from someone who is being lame bcus they wanted to do that for you asking I'm assuming even though it's not a bad question to ask necessarily.. . but then again there are questions that someone may find just to not be a good question or a question that has been asked repeatedlyThere are trolls here that hand out these thumbs down like they were halloween candy, just because they canBecause every-ones opinion differs, What You or I may find a " good " question or answer others will not.. Or others will just not agree with the wording or the topic.Some people have different ideas of what a "good question" is, and some people just troll this place and do thumbs down just for that purpose, and some give thumbs up to their friends and thumbs down to everyone else, the possibilities are endless.The people that give thumbs down to good responses/questions are normally people that don't have a clue of what is being asked.There are people who take things too seriously or are too bias. I rarely give a thumbs down to something that's decent, even if I don't agree with it. I usually thumb down if someone doesn't give any information towards the question, are being rude, or if they were too bias. With my questions, I've only thumbed down one that was mediocre, but that was because the person threw personal attacks as well, which I found unnecessary and in a sense juvenile.When I find out what a troll is, argh!!, hear that so much, but I will find out. I think responders fly in and out clicking away, because I have seen some questions with only 1 responder that has 5 or more thumbs down, if someone is not concerned about the question why do this?  I don't believe there are any points, (if that is what you are after)  Do birds of a feather flock together?
The answer has received too many thumbs down. You can change the setting at the top of the column to show all.2 or more people gave it a thumbs down i believeYOU DON'T HAVE THE "VIEW ALL" SET AT THE TOP OF THE QUESTION / ANSWER SECTION.its the new yahoo answers rating enhancements that have just been implemented.. . your default setting is set to -2. which means any answers will two or more thumbs down will be hidden from you. yahoo is assuming these answers are bad answers which other users have given a thumbs down too.. . you can change that by just clicking on rating status at each question. once you set what rating filter you want it will stay that way until you change it again.. . hope this helps you a bit. check the blog out for all the new features.. . http://blog.360.yahoo.com/y_answrs_teamIt means that 2 or more answers have gotten a thumbs down and theyre hidden. You can set that the way you want to by clicking on the SHOW box beneath the question. I have mine set to show all answers.Other users have given those answers more than two thumbs up, and Yahoo! thinks that the rest of us don't want to read something that someone doesn't really rate. If you want to view all answers, just click the appropriate choice from the drop down menu above the answers.That it has been voted thumbs down you can click the show -2 and change it to show lower rated answersIf any answer receives  -2, it gets hidden
There should be an option in your mail options to switch back.  I think you can do it when you first open beta mail box.  I don't really like it either.on the top it says switch back and click on thatat the top it will say change back....to change back to the originalThere is a Switch Back link under your ID that will take you back to regular mail.Whenyou first log on to your mail, there is a small sentence that says 'change it back" click on that. I think this stays at the top of the screen when Beta is open, too.1 Click on SWITCH BACK TO YAHOO link on your inbox page (given at the left hand top of the page, under your ID). . 2 As you sign in to beta, there is that guy jumping on the ball, under that there is a link - TROUBLE LOGGING IN?, click on it and click switch back to yahoo. . 3 If the above doesn't work then you can click the link below. On the next page, click on MAIL (at the left ahnd top of the page) and as soon as you get into your mail, click on SWITCH BACK TO YAHOO. http://wap.oa.yahoo.com/raw?dp=home......there is an icon - change back- click
Nope.You don't!. . If you sent it it is sent and will be received.You can't retrive it, however, if you have the settings, then your sent messages should be in your sent folder.In most cases you can't, like email, unless you can hack into that person's account and delete the sent message. If the message is in the form of a post like forums and myspace, the 'delete' button is made handy in every post. This really comes down how the site is set up. Unfortunately theres no standard for post-type sites. For instance, on xanga, you'd have to delete your account to kill a message and for some reason this worked for my friend and not me. On Youtube, your posts are permanent. You could try killing your account, but again, it depends on how the site was made. On ebay, you'd have to get confirmation from the reciever to amend a comment.. PS. The guy above me is right about the 'sent' folder. If your goal is to keep a copy for yourself, then it should be in there as long as this feature exists and the feature is turned on.
c:&#92;documents and settings &#92; your username &#92; your documents &#92; my received files &#92; your messenger email address, and then theyre are inside there :D. . try that ;)Go to "Contacts" >scroll down to "Message Archives". . Or, go to "Messenger" [near Contacts] >'Preferences' >click the "Archive" tab and you can get to your archive through there.

Because of the anonymity on Yahoo! Answers, it may be easy to overlook someone's nationality when it's not explicity stated. However, there are people asking and answering questions from all over the globe, so users may be more diverse than they appear. :-)Is it possible that they are interested in answering questions in relation to their culture....who knows,  . . i doubt they answer questions pertaining to their own culture only .....cos they are mexican people and they only talk about stuff related to their cultureAre you prejudiced against Mexicans? If anyone asked a question about Brits, it would be natural for Brits to answer, wouldn't it? So why shouldn't Mexicans answer questions about themselves. After all, they know more about themselves than anyone else does. I also answer questions about Mexicans, because I live in Mexico and have many Mexican friends.That is so absurd! It is even more absurd than my own questions, and some of them are really stupid.. . no, sorry, your point is out of truth, and of common sense. . You know, not all german are nazis, not all spanish are flamenco dancers, not all the italian are spaguetti fans, not all the mexicans have some problem with justice, not all americans are stupid, not all the english women are ugly, not all the danish boys are beautiful, almost they are...well, dear, do not worry, mexicans are just the best people in the world. Give them a chance.may be they want to expose their stuff
There really is not enough information here to answer a question. . . You obviously know how to create some accounts as you clearly have a yahoo account and a yahoo answers account as evidenced by you posting this question.if you dont know how to create an account:. go to yahoo and click My Yahoo!  Once you are at the log in screen and then click create account.excuse u lil snobo. dont come  on my questions and tell me how to run my life. stick to yer lil corney crapy questiosn and stay the h*** away from mine. ok u need a life. and by the way u said u wnated advice so heres some. . . grow up!. get a life!! '. do a tree!!
It must mean that the person who asked the question isn't accepting mail from other Answers users. You can go to their Q&A page and see if they are accepting emails or IM's.William Lackner Is this you? … :)! . http://www.osoq.com/funstuff/extra/extra01.asp?strName=William_LacknerSOmetimes the person declines to allow that optionSome times you can email them....go to their 360 page and sometimes, they will let you email..it is a personal choicePart of the point of this site is to create a searchable database of all questions and answers, so people can find their answers -- notice the Search and Discover dealies along the top.. . So if someone has the same question, Yahoo wants all the answers there, where the searcher can find it.
Are you serious? When you read the email, you will have a button says " delete", press on it, do you know how to press on it? just one left-click on the mouse...the rest of the stuff will be taken care of by the O.S. so don't worry. thats it.Press Delete.Just delete it. Click the Delete button and the message goes into the Trash folder.Just delete it and it goes right to trash.delete it, then it will automatically go to your trash folder.. to delete an e-mail you:. 1.select the e-mail(s) you want to delete. 2.click on the "delete"button. theses instructions are for when your in the inbox page.. but if your reading an e-mail and want to delete it, just click delete.. i gave you a thumbs up because this is a good question.
hello this happened because your one page file is more than 10mb. . if it is a simple text file then reduce its font size and the check the files size.. . if it is picture then reduce its size.You will have or to zip it or to divide into 2 or 3 parts,Yahoo can`t send more than 8 mb.
Once you log in, the next page that comes up will be the main mail page.  Next click edit which will be on the left of the menu box tht will include "inbox, draft, sent, bulk, and trash."  By clicking "Edit" this will show you all the folders you currently have, from this new screen you can delete any folder you want.. . Hope this helps. Have a good daygo to the folder you want to delete then right click on the folder name, then click on delete.. . Note you have to delete all the messages in that folder first in order for you to delete the entire folder.
OMG it did it to you too ya and it takes 10 points i was pissed... then when you ask why they took ten more points from me so twenty and all i asked was "What did everyone do today" grr. yahoo answers grr....  Sorry that happened it sux i know!some people are ignorants  if they do not like something  move ahead  and have fun without insulting any oneDon't worry about it , its happened to me to I Guess they just didn't  like our question . May God bless you and have a great day
Click on your avatar, scroll down the next page, click on MY QUESTIONS, click the question whose expiration period is to be extended. Once the question opens, go to the plus sign , under the question and there you will see the option EXTEND EXPIRATION, click on it. . You can do this only once for one question.If you havn't got many answers for a question you asked then Yahoo should send you a email asking if you want to extend the deadline. Just click on the link they give you in the e-mail and that automatically extends your question.View your question.

Hi. . Prob because there are so many boring farts like us on with nothing better to do on o Friday,l'm only on because my bfriends out on a lads nite out and l'm stuck in cause my mates don't want to go out in the cold!this sucks!!!I thought i was going mad....... Thanks for putting my mind at ease!they had problems which froze it up 2 hours ago. It's ok now.Thought it was just happening to me.I don't know but I don't like it. Everyone has 500 plus answers and I feel like I'm in the twilight zone.They might be on strike!  They might be messing with us!. . There are still plenty of questions though!
'Ask, and thou shall receive.' . Seek, and thou shall learn !bcoz he doesnt answerto receive answersTo see and learn th respomnses, to take a social risk often the answers are cruel, I have learnd through asking i believe 210 questions to date if I am right, now with about 17,368 points or so.....I am tired of this format..tho sometimes i still laugh.....I have pulled away from chat which IS good.....listeing to the banal conversation, being accepted into some cyber cadres and nearly disemboweld in other  rooms where they are so protective , it is a mystery to me why on earth I ever bothered....for my very best friend online has turned on me after 3 plus years to the point that i am creating new i.d.'s and going else where..now THAT is sad.....i was looking at this as a coping mechanism to stay out of chat, LEARN new things, not necessarily learn but learning i have been doing and though it is a facade of avatars and watching certain constant people pass through many of the same columns that i do with nopretense...their humanity strikes me.....it is refreshing. It is as though each time I blink I am reborn...though admittedly whene i hit level 7 I think i shall call it quits. perhaps I will saunter in for the occasinal hello and answer a q or two..but nothing like pushng for personal best anymore, so i just joined two book clubs tonight preparing myself for the inevitable. You asked and this is why "I" ask questions...... Thanks. LioncourtIt may be someone that really needs an answer, OR it may be someone thats just screwing around to pass the time.To gain knowledge.
You need to cut off the electricity to that socket, remove the plug in, cap off the electrical wiring, replace the sheetrock where the outlet used to be, plaster over to correct the openings, sand to smooth and paint - tada - you are done!!!. . Best of luck!!To delete a plug-in that is in messenger click my plug-ins then click the trash can beside the plug-in. You can only do this while that particular plug-in is not in use.
first u go to ur mail.then click my account on the top of the page.then click change passwordClick on My Account under your ID. Verify password and you will see where it says Change Password.
just click on q and aI'm wonderin same thing but, I went from Q&A to profile just now lol (wink) :-)If the person has the Y! Answers badge in one of his/her blog entries, you can go to the person's Y! Answers profile from there.
It depends on model you have. USB, IrDA or BLUE TOOTH. Or via e-mail through GPRS. USB is the best (my opinion).send it as a message from your phone to your email address. then download it from there.
Go to the yahoo page. In uper left hand corner select TOOLS, INTERNET OPTIONS, SELECT AS HOMEPAGE.go to yahoo.com and at the to it will say do you want to make yahoo your home page.on the tool tab at the top of the page click tools then internet options and then type in the yahoo addy or copy and paste it in the box then click use current
Some idiot reports it.Usually if it violates the Yahoo answers rules it is removed.I would think because it has already asked?The reason for removal of any question is they violate the Answers Community Guidelines or the Yahoo Terms of Service. It is important to read and understand them.  If you haven't read them, please use these links and read them:. . http://docs.yahoo.com/info/terms/. . http://answers.yahoo.com/info/community_guidelines;_ylt=Aq0HJWWqxU.cf5BAiU6O6rc_zKIX. . There are people on Answers that derive pleasure from reporting questions and answers even though they do not violate the CG's or YTOS.  The Abuse reporting system is so overwhelmed that almost any report is automatically processed without review of its validity. This gets many people multiple violations resulting in their Answers Account being suspended. This abuse can also get their complete Yahoo Account deactivated resulting in the loss of  the email account, websites and other services. . . By reading and understanding the CG's and YTOS you will be better equiped to appeal any bogus violations you might receive.You have probably violatedm the TOS (Terms of Service). Read the long boring thing thoroughly as you need to follow it to the T.because it violates the community guidelineswhen you violate some of the terms of service of yahoo, when u ask too non-sense questions or not a question and when you post a question that could hurt other participants and other people... and many more reasons i guess.... just read the TOS and the agreement you agreed upon when you first register yahoo... I asure you, you'll understand better and you'll get better answer in your posted question...I think I just learned something. It sounds like you put a question on Your Watchlist, which was subsequently deleted from the forum for the reasons stated above, and the question disappeared from your watchlist. I did not know this would happen and now I know.
PLUS, you can right-click on anybody and give them different settings. Stealth settings.I don't know if you can hide it once you've allowed yourself to be on your friends' list. But you can be INVISIBLE if you don't want anyone to see you're online.. Click MESSENGER on your YM box, select Privacy Options, then check on ALWAYS SIGN IN AS INVISIBLE.. Hope this helps!
You can't "set your computer" to do that. You need software that will remember every keystroke that is made on your computer. This isn't really a nice thing to do to your friends though.yup there are many software available ...
SpamGuard Plus uses sophisticated algorithms to learn what you consider as spam by analyzing the content of the messages you report as spam or not spam. These algorithms need a certain amount of content before they can predict what you consider spam. Therefore you might have to report the same type of messages several times before it's directed to the right folder.question not clear

You cannot do that. Once you are on here, your questions and answers are property of Yahoo! Answers. Only they can close your account, and then they only do that for violations.yeah, you won't be able to get rid of your answers account.... . unless you are incredibly inappropriate.... . then again, why would you want to do that?. . anyway, yahoo would probably also revoke your e-mail address.. . so just keep your account here, but never use it.. . . . goodbye....
you shold always try and keep a draft for the email. if not im sorry to say your msg is probably gone forever.Sorry, but odds are it's probably be gone.  When writing an email, be sure to highlight and copy it often.  That way if you lose it you can paste it right back in.  Or you can keep a draft copy.If you never kept a "draft" then I think it may be gooooone.
First, never put your email address on any public site. Now you are sure to get tons of spam.. . To block a sender just mark the mail as spam and it will be filtered the next time it arrives. There is a limit to the number of spam blocks so you should check the spam filter under options to see what you have there.Also what you can do is click on preferences (all emails have one) and select "Block List". You can ad any email addresses you want to.you need to enter him in your spam blocker
That means the email did not get sent. There are several reasons. 1. You have no connectivity to the internet. 2. Your email software  is not configured correctly,have it checked out by the company whose service you are using. It is their job to make sure your email is working.. . Are you receiving emails without any problems?. Does the error message come with all emails you send? . Call customer support.U check the mail id before sending the mail. They are case sensitives, so a slight mistake will lead to failure notice.if it mail that is returned to you, then check the email addy for errors.  The tiniest missing item will cause a failure. even a missing dot.  OR perhaps the recipient has changed their email. . E
yahoo staff does this so the voting is fair and your not looking for a high level member or a friend but honestly reading the answers to vote the best answer. It also helps cut down on gaming. if you answer a 100 questions a day which will be 500 in the span of a week which it takes for voting comes in you forget many of your own answers and since your pic and name is removed you do not know which of the answers may be yours so voting for yourself is a lot harder to do.Because you are in voting mode. Identities are kept hidden so your vote is supposed to be imparcial.Because the question is open to voting for best answer and Y! is trying to make it objective...if you can't see the avatar, you can't vote for favorites/friends, etc... Just vote based on answer.. . Good question! It took me a while to figure it out too.Not understanding what you are asking (sorry)Those are the questions that the asker never picked a Best Answer too and it is up for voting for the best answer by the rest of us.
Click search on the start menu, click history by going to <View>, <Explorer Bar> or you press Ctrl + H, right click on Number of list in the History and click delete.. . Another thing you can do is to clear history by reducing the number of days in the history. Go to the internet explorer, Click <Tools> on the menu bar, click <Internet Option>, under history change the number of days to 1. This will reduce the number of days, i hope it is clear.if you use firefox, go to tools -> options -> saved forms and uncheck that box that says "save information I enter...."  In Internet Explorer go to tools -> internet options -> content and click the AutoComplete box... then uncheck the boxes you dont want... This is a permanent solution.  You will never have to clear the history again...hope i helpedClick on the word Google on the left of the search field. Select Clear history.

In Y!Mail you have a stat bar on the right side of the main page. To get to the main page, login to Yahoo Mail and you're there. If you're browising folders or composing mail, you can click the Mail tab to get back there. There's usually an advert on that right side of the page, and just above it there is a green bar which gives a percentage.as soon as you sign into your yahoo mail go into your inbox and you should see your storage quota there and you can also go to folders and you will see exactly how many megabytes you have used up
don't treat them as if they are criminals. you could just offer them help if they need it..Get them a job. That would be the best way to help them become independent and self-sufficent. It would give them a sense of self-worth.First I would enroll them back into school, Then I would ask that they find a part time job, this give them their own spending money, and gives them some responcipality...
i dunno about beta but in the regular version,. you just compose. insert addresses. on the very bottom of the page, it says check all then . insert checked contactsUsually u can create a group/list, and add what all friends u want to be in that group. Than send the mail to that group/list.. . by default yahoo has list EVERYONE. Were u can send mail and the mail will go to everyone in ur contact list.
You could send them an email and ask for their messenger screen name.  Then you can send them a messege and chat.  If they have yahoo 360, then odds are they use yahoo messenger too.Uh, with your computer....duh.. . Good Luck!
All you do is right click on your file and it will have a list of things you can select, one being email recipient, click on that and away you go.  Good LuckCan you please rephrase your question.  It doesn't make any sense to me.  You don't have to ask another question and waste your points.  Simply click on the little pencil at the end of the YA toolbar and press add details or edit question and then submit that.
If you are having old yahoo mail, ten just hit the address bok button andfind the ''add contact button'' . To be online, download yahoo messenger.its very simple really. u will have to download yahoo messenger. then u can add your contacts to make your contact list grow. when adding by email ids, just remember to add the name only, no need to add yahoo.com or yahoo.co.in. . when u log in its your choice if u want to log in, in a visible mode or invisible mode. then just send an IM to the friends who are on line & u can chat away.First download the latest yahoo messenger and install it in your computer...then run the messenger and sign in with your yahoo id and password(the one which you use for email will do!!)...thus you are online now. Once you are online there is an Add icon in messenger click on this and add the contact...either you can give his/her yahoo id or choose it from the contacts stored in your address book!!. All the Best :)
Just copy and paste the text from the email.. Then, to keep your friend's email addresses private, send the email to yourself and BCC everyone else.  This protects them from spammers.Hightlight and cut the e-mail addresses or highlight and copy then paste to new e-mail.. . I do this frequently with "good" jokes I forward so they don't have 498 e-mail addys on them.. . Cheers!To cut put cursor in front of first letter in email hold down and drag to where you want to end.Lift finger off all should be highlighted(black on mine) and hit cut on toolbar above email. It's the one with scissors.You might want to practice on something first, once you get it it's easy.either hit reply and delete all previous addresses or copy and paste on a new compose email.click on forward... ,place mouse curser behind all email addresses .back space those outDon't waste time with copy & paste or endless backspacing. This is quicker and so simple.  Click on forward as usual. Highlight the unwanted addresses and press the delete button on the keyboard and puff-f-f, they're gone. Only the outgoing will be changed. The original remains unaltered.
If you have Yahoo delete your spam immediately, you can never receive them or see them.  If otherwise, you can find them in the spam folder until Yahoo deletes them at a scheduled time.Go to block addresses in options and dig them out.If they've been blocked you still get them in your spam folder.  Check there for them.  If you have deleted them recently you can check the trash folder for them.Look in the trash folder and the spam folder.. . If not there you're out of luck with Yahoo mail.You don't get them.
I had something similar happen to me. I was able to find them all though. Go to "search" and type in "desktop". That will hopefully find at least one folder called "desktop". Click on it, and hopefully that will have all of your missing desktop icons.go to display but hit on desktop, on property  click on appearance and hit show icons.just right click on your desktop, choose Arrange Icons By > Show Desktop Icons. That's it...Funny I should run across this question, the same thing just happened to me while check out Q&A's. I'll give the advise a try.
Without yahoo answers breaking the law (privacy act ) there is no way but you can change you settings to not allow the nickname through mto your inboxYou can try a whois search using their IP address. You will find it in Full Headers on the lower right corner after you open their mail. I'm not sure on this, you can ask on YA, I think it's the last IP address on the list that you will need to do a search on.If you got an e-mail that has no one in the sender field, you might as well delete that right away. In this era, there are a lot of spam mails and e-mails that contain viruses and trojans. If you happen to open one and activate the attachment you'll be sorry. One good rule, never open/read messages from someone you don't know. The sender must at least have an introduction on the subject. An e-mail without subject and sender details is an e-mail not worth reading anyways.
yes.you have to remove the entire message in order to remove the attachment.. . But if you wand a trick, reply that message to yourself, the attachment will gone, but you will keep the text of the mail. after that, remove the original message.. . Florin.
Just ask this person and watch carefully when (if ) you convince him to show you.. http://www.crissangel.com/indexFlash.htmltake lots of acid or cocaineYou can levitate if you focus really hard. I do it to impress my friends.You can't. Levitation is something that people believe that you can achieve through spiritual traning, purifying yourself, increasing your religious beliefs, meditation, etc. It's not possible at all.
put log off, maybe that will helpTwo ways. take it out of your start up programs. Or, on the log on for Yahoo Messanger uncheck the box that says Save Password.
If you use a main screen password on a user account, clik the help symbol beside your name.Click on forgotten password?  Your hint will then appear as a help.  Only way to do it.
You can't....now we are going to look at your previous questions to see what you are embarrassed for us to see.If its already been resolved you cannot delete it.  Otherwise, below your answer is a tab that says "Delete", self explanatory.you are stuck with them forever  #@$%!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!You can't--it's there for good.. . Here's a rule of thumb for the internet: if you don't want someone to see it, don't write it in a public forum.I do not think you can delete them why would you want to?I don' think You can.Click on the question and see if the option delete comes up. If it does then you can and if it doesn't then you cannot delete the question anymore. Unless of course you want to reportyourself and lose points and or access to the site.Never post anything on the web that you don't want the whole world to read. Not just here but anywhere.. . The purpose of this site is to create a database of questions and their answers.. . Notice the Search and Discover dealies -- you can look for answers to questions that have already been asked and answered.. . Thus, YA saves all resolved questions and answers.. . True, they should explain this upfront, but, as I say, you should never email or post on the web anything that you don't want the whole world to read. You never know what's going to happen to it.. . If it's a matter of life and death, you might try going in to Help and finding the link to send a message to Yahoo and ask them, or, as another answer said, you could report it as an Abuse, but there's no guarantee that it will be removed.go to ur qestoin and its goin to say delete qestoin click on it and press yesYahoo wont let us delete resolved questions. They keep them here for some weird reason. You CAN delete open questions though.. . Ive even reported myself and asked them to remove one of mine....they didnt reply and they took 10 of my points.You can't delete questions that are resolved.. . If you have deleted questions but you can still see them, don't worry. They're greyed out and you can't click on them to view them and the answers. No one who views your profile can see them.you dont
Yahoo! Mail is committed to eliminating spam and offers several tools to help you keep spam out of your inbox. Yahoo! has consolidated several of these tools under the "This is Spam" link next to the From: address in every message. . The most effective way to prevent spam from entering your inbox is to use SpamGuard. Help increase SpamGuard's effectiveness by sending examples of spam to Yahoo! to review. Yahoo! will use the messages you send using the "Spam" button to constantly improve the SpamGuard technology. . Yahoo! Mail offers you the ability to create filters for your account. You can create filters to deliver emails to a special folder or to the Trash that:. . . contain specific words or phrases . are from a sender's domain . containing other characteristics you find in spam . . Yahoo! Mail allows you to prevent future email from a specific email address from being delivered to you at all. Note that many spammers frequently change their email address to avoid this technique. . You can choose how long you want to keep messages in your Bulk Mail Folder. You can choose to drop all messages in your Bulk Mail Folder or keep messages for 1 week, 2 weeks or 1 month. The default is one month. . To edit this feature: . . Click "Mail Options" . Click "Spam Protection" . Here you will have the following two choices: . . . "Immediately delete these messages upon receipt". . "Save these messages in the Bulk folder" and select the desired timeframe from the drop down menu. . Important: Occasionally, valid email messages may be perceived as spam and delivered to the Bulk folder. Please note that if you select this option, you will not have an opportunity to review the messages in your Bulk folder before they are deleted. . . . Click "Save Changes" . Outside of the specific tools that Yahoo! Mail offers: . . Never respond to unsolicited email (i.e., spam). To the individuals who send spam, one response or "hit" among thousands of mailings is enough to justify the practice. &#92; . . Never respond to the spam email's instructions to reply with the word "remove" unless you trust the company sending the email. This is a ploy to get you to react to the email and will alert the sender that your email address is open and available to receive mail, which greatly increases its value. If you reply, your address may be placed on more lists, resulting in more spam. . . Never click on a URL or web site address listed within a spam email. This could alert the site to the validity of your email address, potentially resulting in more spam. . . Never sign up with sites that promise to remove your name from spam lists. . Although some of these sites may be legitimate, more often than not, they are address collectors. The legitimate sites are ignored (or exploited) by the spammers, and the address collection sites are owned by spammers. In both cases, your address is recorded and valued more highly because you have just identified that your address is active.if there are unwanted mails then put it as spam which would reduce ur problemperhaps you can install the yahoo anti-spam softwares some of them are even free for download.. check in yahoo website ...you get an antispam software for free... install it and sit back and enjoy browsing without any spams....!!!!!!!!You can block the address if they're coming from the same place.  Mark items that are junk in your inbox as spam.  Bulk is supposed to be where junk goes, so you could just empty it without looking at the contents.1- download anti-spam software from yahoo & instal it. 2- block and keep the unwanted messages in spam. 3- simply delet such messages in mass

Idle means you arent using the computer at all and you didnt set an away mesage. If your friend walks away for a certain amount of time, generally 20 minutes, there status will automatically be set to the Idle status. Generally its like auto away when your computer isnt being used at all.Means he is on line but doing nothing with yahoo messenger-Yahoo chat -yahoo emailing or other activity on Yahoo.Yahoo shows it since how many minutes he/she remains idle.SIMPLY PUT , IT'S LIKE WHEN YOU STOP YOUR CAR AND JUST PUT IT ON PARK , IT'S STILL RUNING BUT NOT MOVING THAT'S IDLEING.(IT'S STILL RUNING BUT NOT MOVING .)still, without action, motionlessit mean your friend is signed in but currently away from computer.same idea as screensaverI'm pretty sure in that instance it means that they have not been chatting/talking online for however long the clock says.  In other words, their chat profile has been idle for 5 minutes...inactive, busy... if you're on the computer it means you were doing something and pretty much not anymore... yahoo messenger for example... if u were talking online and now are not and have walked away you're idle now. not using it anymore...idle mean you are signed on but you have left the computer for that amount of time shown & when it is not idle no more that person is back.motionless

.....Only hit the spam button for the in box. You only have 500. In options on the mail page hit block addresses. You will have to reset at 500.Depending on the package you are with you can usually do this before you open the email. Some will ask you if it is spam. Say yes and some will allow you to block it and just block it then. Some also have the possibility of bouncing the email back to the sender which makes it look like your email address isn't active.
its not that they are slow. its just that they are in front!?! it makes you think that they are slow.Thats exactly what the person behind you is thinking............if they were behind you it would be a different thing!You can't go any faster than the person in front, or any slower than the person behind.yea , thats true, everytime i walk down the street , the people are so slow, or drive , the person in front is so slow....yet their in front...As my old Grandma used to say "Why are you in such a hurry to get to the grave?"

Underneath your friends list is a place to invite friends.. Type in your friends E-mail address & send out the invite.There is no other way. Either you have to invite her/him or vice-versa. This happened to me, too.
so enroll in the program already.  . . or do another 1-time free contact from another email address or another computer - tell him "I'm flirty so-and-so who contacted you before but I'm too cheap or too scared to enroll in the program"Herb from Chicago, I couln't email you because my "wallet" had a problem, actually Yahoo had the problem. Took me 2days to discover this possible way to contact you. I have very short red hair, hazel eyes ans Yahoo rejected my picture; NO idea why, was quite benign. You're profile caught me by surprise. Maybe we won't be a match but I'd like to get to know you and hear all your wisdom & experience. Maybe you are the mentor I've needed in last few years as I contemplated approach etal to book many tell me to write...If u contact me at ajanimi@yahoo.com or ajanimi@gmail .com.

No ulterior motives. I hope you get this and email me. I come to Chicago, often, brother & sister out that way. Sincerely, Michelle. PS. Thanks for the recognition, thrilled me. U r 1rst man who didn't come off crass or an ass.You will have to pay the fee's to be able to contact him. You should get a 7 day free trial, but you have to use a credit card to sign up......cancel the subscription before the 7 days are up. Contact him during that week.
make sure firefox is your default browserYou have to set Firefox as your browser. When I downloaded Firefox it asked if I want it to be my browser& I clicked ..YESWhy don't you copy/paste the link in internet explorer and paste it into the url in Firefox.  That way, you can view ppl's user profiles at Firefox.  This is at least one way you can do.Firefox is just a toolbar, options, search engine, etc.  Internet Explorer is where all the information is.  :). E

Uninstall and reinstall 8.0 or 7.5. You may have a virus thats causing it to shutdown your sound card from yahoo messenger. http://download.softpedia.ro/software/INTERNET/IM/Y!Multi%20Messenger%208.0.0.508.zip is a copy of the 8.0 download for yahoo messenger. I hoped this helpYou installed the new version (8 and up). With this version the sounds associated to the actions are more like hisses then anything else.

Click on Options and then on Signatures. You will be able to edit, change or add to your signature.click option over 2 your right in mail room and click signature.. sign into your account and click edit , 2 make a change.. but i don't think it's a great idea 2 have your real name and address on comp.. because hackers do get in and steal info..NOT a good idea.Fast way for identity theft users to get you.I   think you are asking for trouble don't you know you can't trust  just anyone with your personal info.

I just delt with mine, it doesn't take very long to figure out what they're about.scroll through all your messages..sometimes they will stick one at the very bottom of the other inbox messages. If you can't find it, it's no big deal...Eventually the system will fix it.
Go to your mail, select 'my account' and edit your contact info.(bottom section).  It requires you to enter something for last name.  If you put a * symbol where it says prefix, your first name in that box, and another * symbol for last name it looks really cute.You can't remove your name but you can edit or change it. . Log on to your yahoo account. . Go to My Account. . Click Edit Address/Contact Information.. Change your First and Last name. (Try putting your nickname or "_" on the spaces because you can't go for a completely blank name).. Click Finished.. Log-off Yahoo Messenger and then sign in again.. There you go! You've changed your display name!Click on Messenger in the menu tab and then click on My Contact Details. Put in whatever you want to be shown.
Sometimes offllines come up when you log in, sometimes it may take a day or two for them to come up.. . If you have your archives enabled then the offlines will be in there too.hi my name is leeanna and ...u cant u can only view them once unless u save them if u need help with that let me know

Simple, add them back on!!if you are talking about yahoo, msn, or aim messenger... you cannot get them back.  sorry!  but, you can tell everyone what happened in your profile and tell them to IM you if they see it and then you will regain sn's...on the yahoo messenger list go to. Contacts tab. click,,,show my online contacts. E
the best way is to report to the authorities.....For that your friend has to contact Yahoo, click on "contact us" and tell the story. Also make sure you tell Yahoo the other person's id that is using your friend's nude photo. I have noticed that, that people steal other people's photos, not nude mind you, but like faces or face and chest, some men even have photos of 2-3 different men in their profile, so I automatically don't even bother to contact them, as I know that they are frauds to begin with. A lot of men don't even have a photo in profile, or any other info, which makes profile useless, lol. No information!!!!!! I am sure Yahoo will straighten this out for your friend and punish the other person for stealing the picture. See if we do not report these people doing all these fradulent things, then the system will continue to be fradulent, but if we report it, the yahoo system will be better and better. Believe me, Identity Theft is a serious thing, if they have your address, phone number, maybe visa account # or even bank account # and they are using it, you should report it to the FBI www.ic3.gov that is the FBI's Internet Fraud Complain Center. I found that website when I was reading an article on the pc so I wrote it down for future use if need be.Contact Yahoo customer care and report this. If you live in the US you can also contact the police.One has to report the deed to Yahoo Customer care as abuse.However,your friend,not you,must report the abuse because it wouldn't make much sense for you to report it.
I am in the same boat as you. I have also listed the same question, in so many words, would you please let me know if if you receive an answer? awayinvictoria@yahoo.comTry ignoring them again then delete them it may work if not contact yahoo directly there may be a problem with your messenger. Other than that its kinda odd because ignore is supposed to keep you from getting messages so id try it again and then delete them and then if it still happens just send yahoo a comment and let them know youre having a problem maybe they can do something about it. Good luck and God bless
well, u can't, just....i guess u can give it to someone else if u want or u can just change ur page or just say goodbye to all ur friends and never return again.You can't delete a 360,follow directions below to make it private>Select the "Settings" option at the upper right of your 360 page and change all of you settings to 'Private'. This hides the majority of your content, if someone stumbles onto your page.. . Perform option #1 and then select the first "Display Me As" option on the Settings page. Now your profile doesn't link to your 360 page. Also, UNcheck the "Activate Simple URL" setting. This way people cannot guess your 360 page by sticking your yahoo id onto the end of 360.yahoo.com. . Perform options #1 and #2 and then delete your friends by selecting the "My Friends" link in the upper right of your 360 page. Select "Edit Settings" on a friend's name, then select "Remove <friend> from your Friends Page". Finally, delete all of your content, blogs, links to pictures, lists, reviews, etc. This pretty much makes your 360 inaccessible and/or unusable by anyone who happens to get thereYou can't delete it. Best bet is just to wipe out all the info, delete all your blog entries and friends and change all your settings to private.you can't delete your 360 page unless you delete your account...what you need to do is delete everything off your page then set everything to private so no one can see your page...

you simply click in the box next to it and press delete above.Opening an email won't necessarily spread the virus.  It's typically when you open some type of attachment or click on a link to a website.  If you are using Yahoo mail there is a little box on the left side of the message.  Just click on the box and a check mark will be there.  At the top, look for the button labeled "Delete".  You can also hit "check all" at the bottom of Yahoo and it will check all of your messages (be careful as you might delete some messages that you want to read or save).  Hope that helps.I don't use Y-beta. Is there not a little check box to the left of the email you can check on and click "delete" or "spam"? I agree with you though. I wouldn't use the beta if you can't delete. . . Or... run an antivirus prog that scans your email for you before you open it.To delete an e-mail without opening it,you check the box next to the e you want to remove,then press "delete" on the middle right side.If its Yahoo email service, then theres little boxes next to the subject of the email when you first go into your inbox.take th view screen off by pressing v and the bottom view screen will disappear.  Then highlight the mail and hit the delete button. I never have the view screen on until I have checked I have no spam. Hope this helps
Buy a surround sound system first ans foremost.  Then you need something (such as an xbox or a dvd player) that outputs in at least 5.1 sound channels.. . Connect the whole lot up, using either an optical or a coaxial cable between the unit and the surround amplifier, get the speakers set up and away you go.setup a 5.1 channel (or higher) system.  that means you have 4 basic speakers, a center speaker, a sub and a receiver to tie it all together.  then you need something to feed sound into the system.  that would be your DVD player, cable box, etc.get a grope of ladies around talking to you believe that is surround sound

It depends on the fax, but there are various settings. Your's is set to automatically answer the phone call regardless- you should set it to answer machine- where it only checks for a fax when you or your answer machine answers the call, and if a fax is present it will recognize it. Or you can set it to answer after a certain number of rings.Hi, . I don't know why.  You can turn your fax off except for when you are expecting a fax.  If you are in a business of receiving faxes at any given time that, of course,  wouldn't work for you.. Hope this helps you.

You can't. . . Gmail will allow copy & paste sometimes, but not always. Guess since it's still officially in beta.... . . Use Mozilla Thuinderbird. It lets you copy&paste as well as drag&drop.I'd like to know how to do that too with yahoo mail. So I will be watching this question. Thank you for asking it. :)To insert a pic in a e-mail but NOT as an attachment just have your E-mail all ready and then find your pic you want. Highlight that pic and on your mouse right click to copy. Then go to back to your E-mail and right click to paste with your mouse where ever you want it. It should work, I just did it in one of my E-mails. Good luck, Daviddont paste!!! just attatch it.....where it says "attatch" the upload......do that!!! dont do anything different! aAAwww lol
cuz they suckRivalry.different networksbecause its yahoo...download trillian. it works with yahoo, aol, msn........well... yahoo is a diffarent company then AOLI don't know but I got so sick of aol, I removed all of it from my computer.
91% of the email sent is spam. You should just delete it and move on.Just keep hitting the "delete" key.  Don't worry about the imposition.  There isn't much you can do about it.Don't click in any link from mails, because some of them have track from what mail clicks are. And if they see click, they will send you lots of other scam mails in future.
do u have ears?Is your volume control panel turned on.  . If the control panel is muted it does not matter if the volume button is on you will get no sound
go to the chap roomthe simplest way to do it is to go to your yahoo messenger. press control + f then that will just show the your contacts who are online.... or an alternative would be go to your contacts on your yahoo account. all those who have yellow smiley faces are online.
Yes, I really do try to help people out - but only those people who ask serious questions. Some people just make up stupid stories, so I give them stupid answers. And, the points are just an added bonus!help when needed...some people ask questions that don't need help.Some are for fun, some are to help. I think the serious questions should be answered in a helpful way. This can be a great forum for sharing knowledge and information. The funny questions, or polls, are just for fun or to get points.both and i got 2 points now thank you and come again lolBothEvery time you ask a question it is minus 1 points!. Every time you answer a question it is plus 2 points!sincerely helping, points is a bonus, sometimes sarcastic just for the kicks.If I understand you correctly, you are asking if I answer questions to actually help people or if I do it for the points.. . I am, by nature, a helpful person, well educated, well versed in myriad subject matter, and I like people. If I can answer a question honestly, I will, with as much information as I can give. I answer in a number of different categories. I will not answer if I don't know the subject, can't understand the question for reasons of poor spelling, poor syntax, or poor grammatical issues.

Check your archives if they are enabled if you don't remember the screen name and re  add them. Youc an also re add them if they are in your address book. You will, in either case, have to send another friend request to them.Was it on a website or a computer-program, such as an e-mail program? Could you add some detail please?. . If its a computer-program, you might get it back by restoring your system registry, where all the windows and program settings are stored, to an earlier date and time. Go to Start Menu, Help and Support Center, then click on the 'Undo changes to your computer with System Restore' link and then restore your system to a date and time before you deleted the contact.. . You might also look in your Recycle Bin for deleted e-mails containing the contact details. Also, if you know the person's name, you could search all the files on your hard-disk in Windows Explorer, looking for files containing their name. Some of these may be old cached emails with their email address.Look inside your recycle bin, then recover it again
There is some little glitch going on right now.. . It's not working for me, either. Neither is giving Q Or A Thumbs up or Down...good question i was wondering the same myself. i would give you thumbs up if i could!peculiar problem dude, sorry but yahoo is workin fine and they are improving for the users only. itll take time and theyll surely improve on it. please have paitence.. thanx

spam it and delete asap.Be sure to mark them as "Spam", not just delete them.. . Also, you may need to raise the level of Spam filtering.. How you do these things depends on the email provider you use.Don't they go into your spam???
I believe that we go through several stages in our personal development.... . DEPENDENCE (as a Small child who cannot feasibly look after themselves). . CO-DEPENDENCE (when we are beginning to make our way into the out-side world.. we still rely on others (parents/teachers/family/friends, but are beginning to create a sense of self - although it is still largely based on what we get from those others, which includes how they see us). . INDEPENDENCE (when we finally break free of needing to be this or that for anyone else and develop into something resembling our true nature). . INTERDEPENDENCE (when we - as a fully-formed logical individual become fully self-actualised and realise that we are all one, and that we need each other- and that it is pretty cool to do so because we really just want to). . Interdependence is very different from dependence or co-dependence, as each individual is seen as being their own person, but connected to all others in all kinds of different ways. . . The BS song (hmmm.... an interesting conjunction) is, I feel an attempt to write a love song from the point of view of someone calling to the lonely.... but may, in fact, be from the point of view of someone attempting to deal with aspects of the Independance stage. . . Each of these stages has pitfalls for the unwarey - remaining dependant is clearly not good for one... hanging onto your mothers coat-tails when you are 35 is clearly wasting a life.... . . But many adult relationships never fully form because one or more of the participants is still stuck in the dependent or co-dependent phase (they still rely on the idea of 'another' to make them feel fulfilled - or to notice that they are alive). . Clearly if one gets stuck in INdependence then one is forever going to be denying the fun and psychological advancement that comes from truely giving of yourself to another. . . The song speaks of all those "lucky" people who need people, and even mentions that we are children hiding their adult side..... "We're children needing other children. And yet letting our grown-up pride. Hide all the need inside. Acting more like children than children". . So the song mentions the fact that some development is needed in order to really create an honest, lasting and fulfilling relationship.. To my mind, however, the song does not go far enough. . . It is reminding people to go beyond the independence stage, but is not really setting that up as a pre-requisite for building trust or creating an equal partnership. It still could be a call for co-dependant relationships as it is not asking for two individuals to come together, but is still giving that old 'you are only half a person until you latch onto someone else' kinda message. . "With one person. One very special person. A feeling deep in your soul. Says you are half now you're whole". . Not so clever, really.no man is an island.accept me of course I'm one of the cook islands.Is that a line or is it a song and by who? I'm curious now.  but if that's the line of the song then i would say everyone needs people for friends, love ones, companionship and someone just to talk to, it also could mean that the singer was once alone and understands how it feels to be alone.I think its about not being lonely. Cause some people are loners and dont mix or integrate with other people therefore they must lead very lonely lives. But if your a social person and have lots of friends and family you should count yourselves as very lucky.This is what I think of this clever question:. . Some people are full of pride to the point that they never want to ask others for help, or want to be in relationship that may show they are co-dependent/dependent.... . I think the song is trying to let people know that 'It's ok' to love and be part of a union, and 'it's ok' to reach out and ask for help or 'it's ok' to accept human compassion as it comes NATURALLY 'it's ok' to have people in your life... it's not a one way street... we help EACH OTHER along the way.I believe it means by needing others therefore being vunerable allows you to love and appreciate life more . . And not needing anyone is a very lonely place to be.... . That's my interpretation...Which song is that?It means that they recognise the value of friendship.
Click Start > Control Panel > add or Remove Programs > scroll down and find Windows Internet Explorer 7 and click on it to highlight it and give you the remove option and click Remove. It will automatically revert back to your previous version of Internet Explorer.Do a system restore or go into control panel,then add or remove programmes and delete it from there.Good answers above.. . I've gotta complain, too, about IE7.  It may work better with Yahoo Mail but it does some nasty things with my other programs.

Somebody apparently reported you for "chatting & personal" communications.  . . Check your email, a vague reason should be there.. . Happens to the best of us.  Apparently someone didn't get lucky last night.someone reported it as offensive and yahoo removed it. it doesnt necessarily mean that it was offensive, just that some reported it and yahoo delete it while they investigate itGo look at your email and see if Yahoo sent you something telling you why they did it. Some people don't like to see others having fun. It wasn't Yahoo who turned you in.. .Sounds like Yahoo to me.Did you get a notice from Yahoo?. If someone reported your question - Yahoo should and would . notify you. Can you tell by your points total if you lost more. than 5 points for asking the question?. Try asking the question again - and see what happens.G'day Bellerose,. . Thank you for your question.. . It was deleted for some arbitrary reason like chatting or personal communications. The community guidelines need a complete rewrite. If someone reports it, it is deleted. Common sense doesn't come into it.. . I had a question deleted over the weekend asking how high were skywriting letters. The reasons that some questions are deleted and others aren't are completely arbritary. If you were to ask it, chances are it would be fine.. . Yahoo! Answers need to take a serious look at this issue as it is cheesing off a number of people.. . RegardsWith trolls running rampants, hading out abuse reports like halloween candy, it is very frustrating when that happens and the Y!A staff seems not to really care about it
Go to your e-mail inbox. Press options (right hand-side corner), there press "mail address" and then change. You can change your nicknames but not your actual address, and if you open another account you cannot transfer from one to other as if it were from another domain. Does it make sense, otherwise e-mail me?if you mean the screen name that is so easy , all you have to do is to add your own ID to your Messenger list , and then you can right click on the new added item "Your ID " , and then choose contact details , then you can remove the old screen name typed in the cell of " first name " and put the one you like , and make sure you delete also the old one in the last name cell , like >>> my ID can be>> pure_power <<, and my screen name be >> Amanda . you can change that "Amanda "whenever you want , but you ca never change the main ID which is " pure power , so you will have to make a new contact then , depends on what you want to change , hope that was usefull

Or, to delete just a single (or a few) searches, just have them highlighted in the drop-down list and hit DELETE -- they will vanish! If you hold down the key, the whole drop-down list of searches will delete.. . If you are using the Yahoo! Toolbar, I believe there is a drop-down box at the end of the search window that has the option to CLEAR SEARCHES on it.This is called clearing your auto complete. If you have Internet explorer, go to your TOOLS then go down to INTERNET OPTIONS. Then find the tab, CONTENT. There is a button in that tab called AUTO COMPLETE. Click on that, & click CLEAR FORUMS a few times then restart your internet explorer & It will work. This also works for google & any other search engions.. . PEACETo clear the yahoo search bar, go to the pencil near the search bar and a drop down box appears.. you will see clear history. that will clear everything.

press Ctrl+Shft+i. that will bring up favorites, i promise it's not some dumb combination that will mess up your computer.Favorites is not a toolbar, but it is a part of the toolbar. To see and select toolbars, click on View, Toolbars and select what you want from there. You can add or remove as many toolbars as you want until you find what you like. . . Personally, I think IE7 is great at screwing things up, and I uninstalled it. It's a personal preference.
In point of actual fact Men are no more promiscuous than Women. We merely have more people taking an interest in our activities (magazines, gossip columnists, TV shows etc.) Men are held accountable for Our actions; mostly by women who believe that They have some right to pass comment on the actions of people that They do not even know. Ever been confronted by the "truth" about someone You know, only to have to defend them against scurrilous lies or innuendos? Men live with it every day of Our lives.Because there are plenty of easy women.. . ((((( r u randy? )))))Promiscuity is equally distributed to the male and female of the species.  If that weren't the case, would the courts be clogged with child support and child custody cases?Why are some women so willing?Can't handle it.Because we like sex, and are willing to act out on our sexuality a lot more than women are.I blame it on genetics!  Keep in mind that for a man to be primiscous there must be a female that is the same, so in some cases it's not just men.

It is a sport..  Action is taken against an object or a person with a goal to be achieved.  ie the sledge (pushing the rock pushing the rock pushing the rock) is pushed up to the line and then measured {or whatever they do to it because I fall asleep at that point}. If you want to rail against things not being a 'sport' look at ESPN and see how many 'world series of poker' shows they have on.  Billiards.  . jeeezzz. anything that can have a guy with the nickname 'fats' can hardly be a sportSo curling is the most boring sport in the world to watch. It's actually fun to play though. You should try it. You might be converted to become a curling nerd.they over estimated the popularity of curlingThere's been 260 questions asked regarding curling. Curling is actually a popular sport in Canada during the winter months, and it originated in the UK, where I believe it is still played.
go to mail box, at the top right corner,click options,then click "block address".Yahoo! Mail is committed to eliminating spam and offers several tools to help you keep spam out of your inbox. Yahoo! has consolidated several of these tools under the "This is Spam" link next to the From: address in every message. . The most effective way to prevent spam from entering your inbox is to use SpamGuard. Help increase SpamGuard's effectiveness by sending examples of spam to Yahoo! to review. Yahoo! will use the messages you send using the "Spam" button to constantly improve the SpamGuard technology. . Yahoo! Mail offers you the ability to create filters for your account. You can create filters to deliver emails to a special folder or to the Trash that:. . . contain specific words or phrases . are from a sender's domain . containing other characteristics you find in spam . . Yahoo! Mail allows you to prevent future email from a specific email address from being delivered to you at all. Note that many spammers frequently change their email address to avoid this technique. . You can choose how long you want to keep messages in your Bulk Mail Folder. You can choose to drop all messages in your Bulk Mail Folder or keep messages for 1 week, 2 weeks or 1 month. The default is one month. . To edit this feature: . . Click "Mail Options" . Click "Spam Protection" . Here you will have the following two choices: . . . "Immediately delete these messages upon receipt". . "Save these messages in the Bulk folder" and select the desired timeframe from the drop down menu. . Important: Occasionally, valid email messages may be perceived as spam and delivered to the Bulk folder. Please note that if you select this option, you will not have an opportunity to review the messages in your Bulk folder before they are deleted. . . . Click "Save Changes" . Outside of the specific tools that Yahoo! Mail offers: . . Never respond to unsolicited email (i.e., spam). To the individuals who send spam, one response or "hit" among thousands of mailings is enough to justify the practice. &#92; . . Never respond to the spam email's instructions to reply with the word "remove" unless you trust the company sending the email. This is a ploy to get you to react to the email and will alert the sender that your email address is open and available to receive mail, which greatly increases its value. If you reply, your address may be placed on more lists, resulting in more spam. . . Never click on a URL or web site address listed within a spam email. This could alert the site to the validity of your email address, potentially resulting in more spam. . . Never sign up with sites that promise to remove your name from spam lists. . Although some of these sites may be legitimate, more often than not, they are address collectors. The legitimate sites are ignored (or exploited) by the spammers, and the address collection sites are owned by spammers. In both cases, your address is recorded and valued more highly because you have just identified that your address is active.Use an email client (like Yahoo! for example) that filters out spam.  That is about the most you can do.Click on Options and then on Spam Protection. Set it to automaticly delete Spam on arrival.

i havent the slightest idea! i know that you are assigned one ID per person. mst have a sophisticated computer program thingy..i too am perplexed.are you talking yahoo messenger i have two ids and when im on messenger i can talk in both ids too diffrent people or same person
It's put here on purpose so that people can ask the same question as you EVERY WEEK.. . go to the Spanish site and have a lookthe UK doesn't actually have any bull fighting venues, I live there, i would know about it.  As far as I'm aware the bull fighting category is  a free for all to ask questions that don't fit anywhere else, that's how I've seen it explained.  it sounds a bit loopy to me to have a category named bull fighting but there it is, it isn't advocating bull fightingIf it wasn't so dangerous for the Matador I would agree.. One guy who retired or who is retiring soon was a massive celeb' in Spain, he was so Honourable and fearless, that when he did a movement to avoid the bull, he would not shift his position once he had adopted it if the bull changed tack, and would stand his ground and take the hit!!! unbelievable, If all bullfighters adopted this method, It would be a fabulous sport/ almost religion.I guess because question categories are not decided on moral grounds but what is legal. Everyone's opinion of what is barbaric and what isn't is different, and it is not up to one person to decide what questions can and cannot be asked (beyond what is legal).. . But for the record, I agree with you, it is barbaric.3 reasons.. . Maybe because Yahoo realised this is place is usualy full of bullsh*t. . . A question,not a reason, who do women, men and teens run after a 2000 pound bull?. . A guy who love to get thrown into the air by bulls and get stamped on got a job in Yahoo! Answers staff.Hi smarty:. I totally agree with you ! This is not a sport, this is a slaughter for a crowd of spectators who are excited by the kill.. The matador entices the bull, the bull charges and he moves, on and on until he knows the bull is getting tired.. Then come out the blades to get every last bit of power out of the bull. Then it is more and more blades until the bull cannot go on and faces the inevitable.. This is not a sport, this is not how a man kills an animal!!. I call this a cowards sport and should be banned!!. thanks. iamjustrandy
You can't delete a 360,follow directions below to make it private>Select the "Settings" option at the upper right of your 360 page and change all of you settings to 'Private'. This hides the majority of your content, if someone stumbles onto your page.. . Perform option #1 and then select the first "Display Me As" option on the Settings page. Now your profile doesn't link to your 360 page. Also, UNcheck the "Activate Simple URL" setting. This way people cannot guess your 360 page by sticking your yahoo id onto the end of 360.yahoo.com. . Perform options #1 and #2 and then delete your friends by selecting the "My Friends" link in the upper right of your 360 page. Select "Edit Settings" on a friend's name, then select "Remove <friend> from your Friends Page". Finally, delete all of your content, blogs, links to pictures, lists, reviews, etc. This pretty much makes your 360 inaccessible and/or unusable by anyone who happens to get thereYou can't delete your 360 profile but you can hide it from everyone so that no one can see it and it's unsearchable.. . Click on your settings tab in 360 (on the extreme top right) and then make your name, your address and everything else that would normally be revealed private. You can also get rid of the simple URL. After that, you profile is invisible and unsearchable.
hhHmmm......................I have been wondering for 3 weeks!The service really stinks!!!Yahoo is such a ***** ******!Thank you.I am done!Typical yahoo, they never respond to me either, great customer support, huh. Mine does the same thing, I have also uninstalled and reinstalled, and changed settings several times. So I am curious as to who can answer this one too.Cant you ask in the Yahoo questions or in the contact us email? Maybe it has everything to do with this new version. Its a......lemon!. Seriously however, just ask them.. Personally,  I dont care  for the new changes myself. There are more steps, What was simple before is now full of extra steps. And what about all the pop ups EVen if you opt for no pop ups, they are there on the sidelines !Same thing happens with mine.. The service stinksI  don't know why it does that but mine has also acted up. Some times i reboot and it helps some times it doesn't. Wish i could help more ... good luck.I have been having the same problem with mine now for the past 2 days and other friends of mine too. I did a clean uninstall and then reinstalled it and nothing worked.unfortunately the problem is within the service. It will clear up. Sometimes months will go by without this happening, and other times it seems to be an issue that won't go away.Be patient, it will. One way to know for certain is by signing in with another service,If it's working then it isn't your computer.try the remember me log in and see what happens.
NO CLUE!!!!!!when u send out any mail from our yahoo, u get a pop up asking u if u want to be alerted when that id responds to your mail. just click on that & proceed according to instructions there.
In researching a question (i.e. history) I learn something new.So that we can sometimes learn from other people. the things they know, that we may not.
Questions that have been resolved.it means you supposedly got your answerIt means that you have choosen a best answer for the question that you have asked.it means- asked - answered - best answer chosen - closed to voting or new answersA best answer has been choosen for the question. People can still go back and put comments though.Resolved questions are questions that have had a best answer chosen to either by the person who asked the question, or has been the answer with the most votes when it has gone to voting. They are still on the site for the rest of us to look through if we ask similiar questions.The question has run its course through the answering phase and the point awarding phase, so it is completely resolved
Good question. There is no getting away from the wretched thing.. As for Emma's answer, I haven't got a messenger button top left of my screen.click on messenger at the top left, then click on preferences, then general. you can change it from there
Yahoo is not closing down. I think someone is pulling your leg.as far as i know there is no plan that they closing down
If you care about your computer...  Never ever use Google..  They add things on your hard drive so when you go to a website you will always have Google ads on it..  Google is the reason why the internet is getting slow..  Use Yahoo..  Don't let anyone tell you different..  Check it out for your own self...  Never use GoogleYou could use the search function on the start menu instead, I think that will work.
Get into the media player settings and sett it as your default player. And, if you still have the problem, get into real player settings and remove the check mark from the default setting.I had the same problem with real player,it seemed like it was taking over my computer so I got rid of it.Maybe you can figure out how to tame it.Good luckwindows can't read it that's why it goes to real
You get your own page kind of like a website and write a blog if you want and post pictures kind of like myspace i guess . hope this helpskind of like myspace but on Yahoo, I think you can blog and add friends and that kind of stuff, not as popular as myspace thoughxbox 360Yahoo 360 is Yahoo's version of MySpace. It has a blog, friends list, and photo album. Anyone over the age of 18 can get a Yahoo 360 page. . . This was taken from the Yahoo 360 Community Guidelines at http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/360/guidelines/guidelines-08.html. . Our diverse community includes members from 18 years of age and from many countries and backgrounds. We provide these Community Guidelines to help keep the community safe and productive for everyone.. . . This is what Yahoo says about Yahoo 360:. . Yahoo! 360° makes it easy to stay connected to friends and family. With blogs, photos, lists, recommendations, and a host of other features, Yahoo! 360° lets you share what's interesting and important to you.. . In my opinion Yahoo 360 may not be as customizable or as popular as MySpace, but I use it a lot more.. . I hope this helps. Good luck!!
Edit the signature option of ur email. Set it to the way you want it to be. U can have more than one signature saved and use whichever suits to receiver.If you are using webbased email you have only one signatures. But if you are using a client program like outlook, etc.. then there are options to create as many signatures (as it is called) you want to. then after typing in your mail, you can just select in form the menu. I can eloborate if u can specify which email / program u use.
My mail says to "move" it to the inbox, and that should "train" my mail to not treat it as spam.  Also, check your spam "blocked addresses"--maybe you accidently marked one as spam.  I know, sometimes e-mails that have had no problem going to the inbox, suddenly start going to the bulk folder for no good reason........that's why I check mine over from time to time....Open the email up and click on the Not Spam button.
Yahoo offers you free email.  This is there way of helping to pay for your free service.It's their way of getting profits.
Sometimes the points for voting goes haywire. It happens every few days. If you ask a question, or answer one, your points will probably change.They sound messed up again.<object width="425" height="350"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/fJmydDGPcn8"></param><param name="wmode" value="transparent"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/fJmydDGPcn8" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" width="425" height="350"></embed></object>Answers other peole question
Go under contacts.. than scroll down to message archive. Your messages should be there. If not... You might want to consider clickin on preferances... than go to archive and pick the "yes, save all of my messages" feature than click on" Apply". So next time u accidently close your IM's you know they are saved for sure and you'll be able to reveiw them when ever u like.1st you need to go to Preferences and enable Archive. . In the future, if you have Archive enabled, you can just look at Archive if you lost your current and offline IMs.you should have "history" in your messenger program, leftside toolbar I believe?
Report as spamWell I use gmail and it blocks everything.

Its to "protect" the millions of kids who use it.  But quite honestly I think they ask the most questions about sex....;All it takes is for one person to report you, and your question goes.  Some people just slip through and don't get reported.Dats ass son.. Just give it a try nigga.You can if you ask them in the right category - MEDICAL problems.Probably to 'protect' the kids. But sadly they are often the ones seeking information here.i think it depends on how u ask it or the words you write. hope this helpsSomeone may report youYou can ask but just be careful with your wording. Choosing your words correctly may be the difference in getting lots of answers and get a violation, so thread carefullyi have seen questions on here about sex, but i dont know if yahoo deleted them or not, they delete normal questions so they might leave the sex ones in, you never know with yahoo!!!!Some uptight person will report it.Maybe people find them offensive.

If its not there, you will need to go to the Open Questions tab.you just go to 'answer' at the top of ur page.. then on the left hand side theres a column with specific topics ie u can go into health n answer questions bout healthwith wordstheres a blue button sain "answer these question" just pressit then ull go to a page where u can write u answer press preview and submitClick on the blue bar that says 'Answer this Question"To answer questions, click on the link to view the question.

try attaching red flag to your mail. people who received this was alerted.All you can know is that is has been sent. I don't think you can find out if it has been read. I hope you hear from your friend soon.
Its a fault in the system, but you can get to it by changing the sequence. To do this click on the box where it shows your rating limit (total rating higher than -5 is standard). There you can choose 'newest to oldest', and reverse the sequence, but the new number 31 will still disappear.Probably the asker decided to remove that answer because he already got an answer or because he didn't want to ask it anymore.I deduce the disappearance to reasons below:. . 1) It was carried over onto the next page.. 2) Removed for community guidelines violation.. 3) The person deleted his own answer.. 4) Hidden by bad ratings, check your setting.. 5) Someone reported the answer to Y/A.. 6) Might be a technical glitch.. 7) You didn’t see it somehow … LOL.. . That’s about all, enjoy!!It doesn't disappear, it just goes to the next page.
tell you son to quit visiting porn sites and entering his e-mailJust go to my account and settings, there you can see a check box which says deleate junk mail when receive. Click the box and say save. Then onwards when ever you receive any junk mails those will get deleated automatically!!!!!!!!!the bulk folder aoutomatically deletes them, you dont have to just leave them there because yahoo takes care of them. most of that is spyware anyway and you cant stop them all so not matter how much they build up yahoo will delete them so dont worry about it.the best thing to do is just open another account and forget about the old one .........if he has family members and friends send them all an e-mail announcing his new address.......... . . . good luck. . -
It just has a little more life to it I guess.The old one was ust a ittle. empty for some reason.i guess they're doing this to keep every user happy..people have different preferences as to how they wana use yahoo..dats why they've come up wit something new plus they've kept the old homepage so that people can use what they like..i think the new one is cool but m sticking to the old one..tried it once but i found it a little confusing!!
If they're spammers, you can't. If you click on the "remove" links in the mails, you'll just confirm that your address is valid and you'll get 100 times more spam.. . Most of the spam nowadays is sent by Russian bot-nets and other hijacked PCs, with fake sender names.. . If spammers have latched on to your mail address, the only solution is to abandon it and get a new address.if the spam is in your e-mail, click the box in front of the e-mail and then click spam above it.. this will put a block on that address.. if your bulk is flooded with spam, click options over 2 your right on mail home page and then click spam protection.. follow the path and click apply or ok.. this will delete all your spam in bulk that you have now and will continue 2 delete spam as it comes in.. never open mail from those you do not know.. never  reply 2 those sites.. because once you do , they will sell your addy 2 the world..  this is the only way i know how you can get your name off their list..
may be DELETED.. or the another way try Ctrl+H.. may it works out..it has been deletedchk if ur id is hacked!!deleted - usually do to pornographic material or content. . try this - send me some of your deepest fantasies and see what happen on teh systemThey probably all deleted you because of your atrocious grammar.
You could consider uninstall your current Yahoo! Messenger and download from http://www.filehippo.com/download_yahoo_messenger/.  The latest version is Yahoo! Messenger 8.1.0.195.  You could also find a list of previous versions of Yahoo! Messenger on the right panel.Try again but double check you are typing in the passwird correctly, first. I am sorry to inform you that Yahoo is having technical difficulties as we speak my friend has had the same problem two hours ago, also they have been updating their systems within the last week.
in the igloosRub two sticks of ice together really fast to start a fire.They turn the thermostat up?. . Really, what a silly question!They're climatised, so it's not as much as an issue as it would be for most. They wear bigass coats, whether you're talking about Icelanders or Eskimos.Jackets?. . FPthey put some clothes on! LOLGeothermo Power. Iceland has more natural geothermo vents than any place else. Steam literally shoots out of the ground in many places, and they have harnassed much of it, and produced energy.  I'm not kidding.They shiver really, really hard and the vibrations cause friction which heats them up. :-)fire

You have to go to edit theme near the top for that. Then hit customize theme and you can change colours etc. You can't change letter size I don't think.Just click on "MY PAGE" itself -- that takes you to the page where you can edit all your photos, blog, information, etc. Don't know if you change font size or print color, but that is the place to start from.

Well is the browser software different from your home and school? is so, then that is probably the answer. Mail beta is an advanced email account version but it is getting a litle frustrating with some people so probably dont do it unless you never have problems before.You could try request from http://advision.webevents.yahoo.com/mailbeta/ and wait for approval in your current Yahoo! Mail in a few days time.  Once it is approved, you will be notified.  Once you received notification, you click on 'Option' and you will see a purple icon on the right which says ' Accept Beta Version'.  Click on that and you will go into Yahoo! Mail Beta.

Automatic. Watch yer avatar.yeah, they go on instantly.Yes, your voting points should be acknowledged by a "shining" star and the 1 point message right away. Don't know for sure how long it takes for them to hit your cumulative score -- never paid attention to that -- but there may be a delay. Make sure you are VOTING (for Best Answer) and not just RATING (thumbs up/thumbs down) -- the first gets points, the second doesn't.They are supposed to be credited immediately but sometimes there are glitches that prevent that from happening.We're meant to earn a point for every vote we cast. We don't get points for voting for no best answers. However, since the end of last week, points don't seem to be registering for voting. There seem to be a number of bugs on the site, so hopefully the Answers team are trying to work on resolving them all - but it may take a while to do so.
its either they change it or there is a virus on their computer... . there is this virus that will send you links and when you click that link, then the virus will be planted to your pc also.. this is beyond your friends' control.. the virus itself sends the messages and changes your friends' status..your friends  can lock you out or sign off or go private at any time, this effects their status on lineOnce you've signed in, Yahoo Messenger monitors your friends online or offline status, given they haven't set into "invisible" mode, where you NEVER know if they're online or off.because they change it... you have no control over that..
If theyre resolved we cant. Yahoo holds them for some weird reason. If theyre open, just go to the question, then click on the pencil icon, and select delete.It will delete the next day.for the 10th time this week....you cant if they are resolved. UNLESS you dont care about points. then you can try reporting yourself and get them removed by Y!AYou can't delete questions that are resolved or in voting, just questions that are open. You will still see deleted questions in your question history, although no one else will see them, I persume as a reminder that you once asked them.  View your question, hover your cursor over the pencil icon and choose the delete option from the menu.Resolved and In Voting questions can't be deleted.
If it is not public, then they don't want the information to be shared/viewed. Respect the privacy of others .You can't really. You'd have to try to meet them another way.
Just hit "forward" and then go into the body of the email and erase all the junk. You can erase it by dragging your mouse over it to hilight, then hit the "delete" key.The method I use is to select "Forward" and then simply use your cursor/mouse to hilite the previous headers and then select "cut" from the Edit menu.. . This should do it.I copied only the part I wanted and pasted it into WORD, then composed an email, with it as an attachment. It's time consuming though.I copy and paste, into a new compose
just click change and it will let you or go to to weather.yahoo.com and choose itGo to "edit" in the top right corner of the weather box, then "edit content". You will get the options "remove selected city" or "add new cities".Click on "add cities" and pick whatever city you're looking for. Hope this helps.
Cause it's hot.. What do jock assholes feel the need to belittle everyone else?y does anyone like to wear them , something up your butt all day would not feel goodWho are you to say that only skinny chicks can buy them?. . You're just ignorant.because you touch yourself at nightBecause they know you are looking at them.because  its a free world  to wear what we  want   why  do old men wear  spedos  and think is  sexy    WHY cause  they  can . . . and  what  do you go around and check out  all  chicks underpantsprobably the same reasons as other people.. . enjoy it, don't insult it.I guess it is because thongs can be very sexy, even if only in the girl's head. I mean, a lot of wearing lingerie is for the woman herself, not for guys. Heck, most guys would never know what she has on under there. Of course, panty lines can be visible which doesn't look good, and thongs take away that. I have no problem if they wear whatever...if they like it so be it.BELIEVE IT OR NOT SOME LOOK GOOD IN THEM...AND ANYWAYS THONGS ARE MADE FOR EVERYBODY NOT JUST SKINNY CHICKS.they wanna show off their big a**esbecause it makes us feel sexy and thats the only thing that we have to make us feel that way.  besides the hot guys we score with them. and besides what do you consider fat and if you think its a turn off why are you looking at every fat chicks butt!!!!! i think you like it and it turns you on!!!!!  besides you know what they say about the fat chicks that wear thongs don't you its easier and they have more cussion for the pushin.  we chicks don't like to be called chicks either.I hope not.because they never look in the mirrorIt's so they'll know for sure that they will look utterly ridiculous when they see themselves in the mirror.  This is the only way they can get enough determination to lose weight.Choose - fat butt in thong or fat butt with large, extra-obvious panty lines.. . I choose the thong.why shouldn't they if they want toMust be because "one size fits MOST"....yuk- but I was wondering how do you know?  Are you a fat chick or do you date them?Some feel that they look good wearing one, and if they feel they do, I will not state otherwiseI didnt know they did but thanks for the image!!!EYES BURNING!http://s109.photobucket.com/albums/n75/nexusinternational_2006/Women%20with%20big%20assets/?action=view?t=ba-fatass-TH.jpgI do not.. And I am a lady,not a chick.Why not?  Why do skinny ones wear thongs? They like wearing them.i dunno i hope they dont loose thier thong in thur fat a*s*si wear them ...but im not fat ....well i mean in a size 6easier to find one that fitsMaybe because their mothers never taught them it is distasteful.  Lack of education.Why are you so interested in what type of panties any women wears?  I'm not fat and i hate thongs it's a matter of choice you do know about freedom of choice don't you!!hmmmmaybe they think their skinny . . :)They just want to.
yahoo let them get away with it .this is  a inside job i have seen one person who comes to. yahoo answers and All he ever does is spam the website he has 2 friends that he email to have Questions removed that he see not to be good. his 2 friends work for yahoo. inside jobI know what you mean...... I have come across a couple of log ins that are obviously the same person and reported them and nothing is done to them...they are prob Y! employeesThere is that guy who posts about THIS IS NOT A SPAM and he must have loads of accounts to keep being able to post this junkOCD?The violations are handled by people reporting the question / answer / person. If no one cares enough to report them, they are not considered in violation. Sorry!

Check your trash.  If you did not delete the trash, you can put a check on it and send it to the inbox.  If you deleted the trash, it is gone.  You can not undelete it.Unless you cleaned out your trash folder it will be there for a day or two. open trash folder. Check box next to message you want to retrieve. Click on "move". In drop down menu, click on folder you want to move message to.. . Thats it. Very simple.If it's still in deleted mail you can move it to drafts folder..If it is not in deleted items it's gone.
You can only access the chat rooms through Messenger. They did away with the web chat.I Beleive Yahoo  mentioned doing away  with the Java based chat system they had,  and therefore Messenger would be the  alternative way to access it, so they could  be pointing you in the proper direction of what you need to chat.. . OR. . it could be typical Yahell glitching up and sending you  to the Arctic when ya were heading for the Bahamas... thatgkinda Clustersmeg... the first explanation makes sense tho...

They demonstrate to what extent a person has no life.lol...The points are mostly for fun. Letting them build, like money in the bank.

There should be a little box on the upper right hand corner that says return to yahoo alpha. It's something to that affect. If you look hard enough should get it.just change back from yahoo beta,to yahoo mail.I have tried Bata before and I hate it! I know how when the little dude pops up on the screen click it and near the bottom it says check your email in Original Yahoo! Mail!When you open your mail box there is a link to take you back to Yahoo Alpha. There will always remain the option of trying Yahoo Beta again.There is something at the top middle(NNW) corner of your screen that. says ''Switch Back''.
Play it and see how much evidence you can get and then you got your case but studyup on what you can hit them up with or get a lawyer it will save you the hassle i mean unless they know you then they don't got nothin against you except try to brong past event up if you have a record. Other then that pray and you'll do ok.do not buy into them even the  real ones that way you won,t spend money on things that you most likely can not win on and the bad ones won,t get another sucker. i presume you are smart for trying to not get fooled by others. teach others when you do find out about the phonies out there  so others do not get fooledjust let them go to your spam mail and dont reply to any of them. best to just ignore them.2 ways, first un-subscribe the lottery if you ever subscribed it, or block that address better reporting them as spam
do this......... click tools,internet options,security tab, custom level,scroll down. till you see("navigate sub-frames across different domains"), click enable, click apply,click ok, exit. try to attach againIf you can't just click 'add attachment" on your email page and click on that specific file you want to send you must copy file by left clicking and holding as you drag mouse over that file, right click-copy, then go into email and right-click paste.Put the file you are trying to send into a zip file (rt click on file click on zip file) and try sending that. If that doesn't work make a new file and put old file into it then send new file. If still doesn't work I don't know. One or the other of those has always worked for me.copy and paste it
Click on "Toolbar Settings" and then click on uninstall.......<D>You probably need to uninstall whatever you installed that caused it, most of the stuff I download from yahoo, asks if you want to download the toolbar, I never do. I have heard that it carrys viruses.. . Just be very causious when your downloading because it sneeks it in there.Start - Settings - Control Panel - Add/Remove Programs. . Select the yahoo toolbar from the list and click remove/uninstall.

It's depressing, isn't it? :(Reaching your limit is a GREAT thing!!!. . NOW you will time to use the site in other ways while you wait!. . You can Rate & you can also Vote for Best Answers!  The best part is, you still get 1 point for Voting!  That way you will reach the next level even faster!  When you reach level 5, there will be no more limits!!. . So see? Reaching you limit REALLY IS GREAT!!I used to hit my limit when I was in the lower levels, too (but then everyone agrees that I'm pretty pathetic).. . :-). . As MsKnowItAll pointed out, you can do other things, such as Vote (Click Discover, then Vote on Unresolved Questions) which isn't as much fun as answering, but gets you a point each, and helps the site.. . If your answers are good answers, you'll get a lot of boosts by being chosen Best, and will be at higher levels in no time.. . BTW, click your points to go to the page that explains all about points and levels.. . And don't forget to choose Best Answers for each question you ask; that gets you 3 of your points back.Not as pathetic as I am, which is still a little less pathetic than my homosexual lover dukalink6000.Your not pathetic, here is the scoring system. You need 250 to get to the next level , each level will increase the amount you can answer and question.That's not pathetic at all. I used to feel the same way. :-) But it gets better, and soon you will be allowed to answer more questions.I thought the same thing the first time I reached my limit too!I would say most of us on here are pretty pathetic, but we're amongst a crowd of our peers!lol, yea, the limit thing sux. No, you arnt pathetic. I was there once. I didnt know everything about the site either. . . Youll eventually get past these limitations. Youll get to ask and answer all you want.Yup. I was there once on this profile. But I got out of it as quickly as I could by answering 20 questions every day until I made it across the threshold. And ten points as best answers helped me a little.how did u ask this question if u reached ur limit?. uc an make another email address and use it to ask more questions. ok byeTonya Harding < me < you. . So at least you're better than some of us ;). . I reach my limit far too frequently.  And this answer (of sorts) will put me up to level 3, so 60 per day instead of 40 (or 20 at level 1). . :o. . EEP!
It's not Yahoo. It's your PC and or internet connection. My Yahoo loads instantly.yahoo was born slow, like me!Connection speed maybe? or are you downloading something or scanning for viruses? try to restart your pc.maybe it's your computerThis is probably because you have a tonne of spyware on your computer that loads up when you boot the internet or log into your account. It will happen regardless of what home page sight is. To prevent it you need to do a spyware and virus scan.Its your computer or the internet you chose. Mine works smooth and fast.use ccleaner
you do this by: ....ok if you go to compose or reply or whatever ,right above the part where you type your message there is a botton that says "attach files " then click. after that you can brose any pic. you already have or put in a url for one....then ta dajust go to attach file, which the link could be anywhere on the email page. once you click that pending on what you use you could just be clicking browse and find your photo.  sometimes a photo will be too big so you may need to on your computer condense the file or zip it is what it is sometimes called.  then once you attach the photo use the condensed file and not the acutal one, because like i mentioned before it would be too big...hope that helps
your question is not clear....if you are able to open your mail...you will be able to compose....you can contact me with full details of your problem.. You can try this Are you using IE or Mozilla?

Go to yahoo mail account, click options, and go to general preferences. Change display name here.it depends wat e-mail u have like yahoo or hotmail

Classic symptom of a zombie emailer.. Get your system and email proggy cleaned up and then get a current antivirus program.  Keep it updated and use it.someone has got hold of somebody's or yours mailing list and is sending spam using your email addressDelete them without opening it is just spam mail but some could contain nasty viruses if opened.. . If you have opened any, run your antivirus software to make sure your pc is clean. Remembering to check for updates first.Sounds like someone is spoofing emails from your account.. . Virus scan your PC and also do spyware check :)Sounds like your e-mail account has been hijacked and is relaying spam.just another way to get you to open spam.. Spamers never quitAlways delete these without opening them ! It's either a spammer or a spammer testing to see if you open such mails or not. NEVER open these kind of mails !

When you never reply to my emails?by clicking on the "delete" button you will send that piece of mail to your "trash". then by emptying your trash it will be completely out of you mail box, but if it stays in the trash it will not count against you total space available and Yahoo will eventually empty the trash for you.Go to the inbox, select the checkboxes next to the emails, and click delete.Hi Mimi, . .

You can't change your email address. All you can do is create a new account.2 ways. 1 d easy way, d other d hard way.. the hard way first...confront ur enemy!. by writing a server side script that would work on all servers and implement it on yahoo servers-all of them in dift locations, or u include code in ur script that wud auto-update the other servers-called data concurrency.. . d easy way....ignore the problem. discontinue use of the email addy,( cos u cant change it baby unless yahoo allows u, which means u gotta contact them...) and get a new email addy.. . d choice is yours
look for the add icon on you messenger toolbar, it's going to ask you to add a persons e-mail address in the provided bar. the rest is self explanatory.you need to send them an invitation  first and they have to accept with return email then they are automatically addedfirst sign into yahoo messenger you go by what the other users had told you or you can go up to the top of messenger there should be like 5 catergories listed click on the one that says "contacts" it should bring down another column and click on the first that is listed should say "add contact" click it and type the persons id name in the box and click "ok" and then they will get an ivitation next time they sign on to their account saying you would like to add him/her and they will accept and thats it!!.hope this helped!
in yahoo mail just point to the little white box next to the email you want to delete and click.  it should put a mark in that box...mark all you want to delete..the go up to the top or bottom of your inbox and select delete....after you have done this they go into your trash folder...go to it and click on emptyCheck the box of the email/s you want to delete then click on the "delete" button.
try allowing cookies that helped mine . if you dont know how to do this the here you go . . you click on tools in your browser the internet options then on the privacy tab and drag the button to the accept line and there you goThere can be alot of possibilities to that. You might be entering the wrong password or have your capslock on. Try closing the internet and then try to login again. Thats what I would do.at a guess, I'd say you got your password wrong   ?cause your computer is messed uptry again later.. if you can come on here, that means you logged in you dumbbutt.
Jan got it backwards. You can only access Chat rooms through Messenger, not the web. Click on Messenger on the menu bar (of Messenger) and scroll over Yahoo! Chat and click on Join A Room.Yahoo did away with chat rooms in Messenger unless you create your own using the conference feature now.   You can get to chat rooms via the Yahoo home page only now.

go to control panel and click on add/remove programs. threr should be a list of programs on your computer that you can remove. and just remove/uninstall BT yahoo messenger.AddRemove programs, you must be logged on as Administrator or have Administrator Rights to actually do this correctly. By default EVERYONE is an Administrator on WinXP, but look at Microsoft site and they say, DO NOT RUN your computer as an Administrator. So does every other OS, it just makes sence. . Surefire way is to make a backup of your OS and all Files and Folders, then Remove, reboot, see if its still there, (probablly is) then you have to go Safe Mode and /erase or whatever the MS-DOS command is, but be very carefull there, it is like hacking the registry, this is ill advised unless you have a Stable Backup that you know works. . A Stable Backup is NOT a restore disk, it is a Backupof all system files to a CD-RW, HDD or somesuch thing. Read about How to backup and print it out. . Computers will fail, OSs will crash, Viruses will infect a machine, the only real defence or protection is a Stable Backup. . Read more at langa.com

If you aren't sending it, probably means you have a virus. I would run a virus scan and a spy ware scan, and hope it finds whatever is causing it.. . I would also tell your friends not to open your emails until you get this resolved. good luckIt is a web site you have signed up with at some time.. You will need to go back to that web page and find the options place to make changes and  remove yourself from that site. What has happened is that it has placed a cookie on your computer to perform this sending of email.  But when you go to their site and discontinue using it .. then it should stop.  Kinda like unsubscribing.. E
Setup a rule to send their messages to trash or deleted folder and delte mail from there repeatedly without reading. Declaring as SPAM may stop their completely forever as one has reported today.What you can do is if you have one of their old e-mails you can put as junk, or spam.

Don't use a freebie email service. Upgrade or use the one that comes with your ISP.If you are using Free Web Mail or a Free Mail Client, you cannot remove the sponsored links at the bottom of your mail.. . These companies earn from the "sponsorship" and thus can offer free service or free software.. . If you really a no sponsored link on your email, you need to have a paid email subscription or a paid email client software.Those emails are subsidizing your free email account.  If you're using a Yahoo! email account, you can upgrade to Yahoo! Mail Plus which gives you ad-free email and other additional features for a fee.
It's not that people forget, they just can't be bothered.  Most people bookmark the link to their question and look back at it periodically.  When they find a good answer, they're generally too lazy to sign in and put it as the 'Best Answer'.  It should be a matter of courtesy, but I guess people are too lazy.Most people come here, ask a question  (or a few) and then never come back.. . That's why.Ok.   that gives one the opportunity to vote the best answer, if you know what I mean. *hint, hint*. . /doc. . Oh the answer to your question: some people come and are not Faithful participants and back out.  Tried it but didn't like it.it could be many things they don't really know what is the best anwers they could be lazy or they could just not care we don't know and either do you only they know why and thats bascailly all we can do is guess maybe they forgot and so onProbably they just can't be bothered to close their question or only come on here twice a month, either that or people don't answer til after the homework is due in.Just because your answers never get chosen as the best...i know i close all of mine but there is4 i am sending to vote.. one has 33 answers and they are all good.. So i al letting voters do it...  now there is other with usless info.. and 1 that i have no idea who is right... and really don't care.. but i think out of all my questions there have been 4 i have sent to vote... . it is annoying when it happens.. espically when you vote on some thing and the stupidest answers are going to get it.. or there is one correct answer and it happens to be the first one and you have every one voting for ones further down the list.. so it stays there for ever cuz of it..Yes, it's quite frustrating when people don't choose a best answer.why does it bother you so?make this the best answer.

Click on their name to get to their profile. Use the report abuse tab in one of their questions. Also use the forum.Just ignore them. There's hundreds of jerks on here. Ususally they go and annoy someone else if you just ignore them.where i grew up we believed snitches belonged in a ditch on the side of the road but,since the people on here are more civilized now;why not just ignore it?you don't have to read something just cause it's written and if you do and it offends you,then it's fault for reading it.you know how the person is so,skip over their post.. why cause conflict?give them their freedom of speach and go on.to many people get reported for things on here that they shouldn't be reported for.everyone is entitled to their own views,otherwise the consitution of this country is nothing more than a piece of paper.we're all grown ups,live and learn;live and let live.You wait until someone tells you to F*uck Off you C*nt...then you press the lil flaggy thing next to the thumbs.it's on the screenbelow their message it will say "Report Abuse" click that.Go to the person's post where you think its abusive then click on "Report Abuse" next to their question/answer.

Click on your picture...that will take u to your site...then click on questions you have asked....then click delete on the question you want to take off here.i think you have to delete the question then ask it again in another catagory.Click on the little pencil on the toolbar and click delete question. Go answer a couple of questions to get your points back and then type the question again in the correct category.You just click on your question and the click the little plus sign and click remove.  But dont remove it just because you accidentally put it in the wrong category.  No one really cares and you'll probably get answers to that question anyway.  If you want just ask it again in the right category.  This way you wont waste the points.If its still open, all you do is go to the question and click on the pencil icon underneath the question, then click delete.. . If the question is closed, it wont let you delete.just go under the button on the right of the screen an delete it, Jamieyou hit the link that says remove question. . . . . . . .edit it, and write something offensive in there---works for me
because some people like to keep clicking the button to send the question in, even while the system is busy sending the question.People don't get the right answer or an answer at all and they keep trying until they do.because different best answers are needed.Some people forget they've already posted a question & post it again. Others want to prove a point.double double vision?. Some questions need emphasising. I can't believe I answered this twice!
your threshold is selected on any question  page it shows . a rated above    -2  on it change that and you change your threshold . by the way its above the first answerIt means that 2 or more answers have gotten a thumbs down. You can change that by clicking on the SHOW box and set it the way you want it. I have mine set to show all answers.Users who are level 2 and above can rate answers by giving them thumbs up and thumbs down. When a answer receives 2 or more thumbs down, Yahoo! has decided that other users don't want to read something that someone doesn't really rate. If you want to view all answers, just click the appropriate choice from the drop down menu above the answers.

Good luck getting Bill Gates and his team to fix your errors there. As far as how to uninstall the Yahoo Toolbar:. . Go to your control panel. Select Add or Remove Programs. The list is alphabetized, so Yahoo applications are at the bottom. Choose Yahoo! Toolbar and then uninstall it.. . If you remove IE7 then you won't be able to browse the internet.. Try to get away from Microsoft products. I suggest Firefox as a web browser as it is less error-prone than its MS cousin IE7.For Yahoo toolbar click on pencil and uninstall. IE 7 go to add remove programs and uninstall.
there's no filtering in deleting. whoever, whatever when that button is clicked you can forget about it.  No recompensation for invalid reporting.. . /docI guess that they think that the question might be inappropriate.Trust me you're not alone here.cos they are braindeadI agree with all of youYahoo removes them, cuz some jerk is reporting them. Its a daily problem here anymore. Very sad. People are leaving the site more and more, due to the unfairness thats going on.. . Someones doing to you out of meanness. Sorry youre dealing with it too.
The dreaded little red square is an indicator of a couple things. It can mean the picture is no longer at that location (you know that is not the problem). It can mean the picture is to big (file size) to view (prolly not the problem). It can mean the picture is in a format that can not be displayed in the application you are in (this would be my bet).hello, Picasa automatically resizes and attaches pictures to email messages, it's free if you want to have a go, it makes it very easy. http://www.sleekbytes.com/picasa-google.htm. .

I don't think you can.You can't erase a resolved question. After the best answer has been chosen then it just stays there for future reference I guess.you can't (as far as I know). but you can change your name and move to another city where nobody knows you to escape friends knowing what you did. (i'm joking)You cannot remove a question after it has been resolved or has gone into voting.. . This question is also a red flag for some people to review your history to find out what is embarassing you.  Several people have placed similar questions.Resolved questions can't be removed. They're kept for future reference.
Cuz someone that doesnt like what youre saying is reporting you, most likely. Which is wrong, but thats whats happening. Yahoo is just letting them do it, and then taking your points on top of it.You must be annoying someoneObviously not being politically correct enough.yahoo is like a communist search engine. You're not allowed to express free opinions or anything about politics.  stupid, huh?I can't say exactly for your case, but maybe it is the WAY you word your questions. You CAN ask a P.C. question with out being aggressively racist or ignorant.Nick, this sounds like a trick question. I've checked your record, and we haven't removed any of your questions. However, if you've seen other questions removed, it may be the asker that deleted the question, or it may have been removed for violating the community guidelines:. http://answers.yahoo.com/info/community_guidelines.php. .

You will need to go to your start button on your computer .. then click on the Control Panel..once there click  Add/Remove programs....then scroll down until you see all the yahoo programs .  select one  then click the change/remove button  and keep doing that until all are removed!If you mean messenger then you go to search on your computers start menu and search for messenger you right click and you can delete from there.Good Luck, the yahoo toolbar is installed from so many products .. one always has to avoid the normal and select customise for all installs nowadays to avoid this form of contamination.. . I doubt you can truely remove it but each product has a configuration or at least the majority do that allow it to be hidden ( but still running ) from view ... . . What I did for other reasons was to reformat and rebuild my machine but for sure everything I install is very very carefully installed and anything that says Yahoo removed from the list of install options... So far no Yahoo toolbar on my machine ( I think who knows ).if it means that much u could reformat ...sorry could not think of anything else....what do you wana do that 4?..dnt access the site atall...Just don't go there ....it's a conscious effort you make when you end up here.  It's not on your computer, it's in your brain.

sadly this cannot be done, a few people have wanted to move the friends around and show some as number 1 etc but to date this is not possible. . the friends list in 360 is updated as your friends update any part of their 360 ie: lists, blogs, feeds or profileThere is no way to do this.

Ignore it.Block your pop-ups.   It's on the bottom tool bar of most computers.   Then find out who has been on the porn links and stay off them.  A filter would help.
Yahoo is a free service. Anybody can have it. Just go to yahoo and sign up.just go to yahoo mail click the link that says billing.mail.yahoo and click the free option and signup for one that's how

I think you can do that there.when she goes to the 360 blog she will need to click on settings and the fist one click on it and you can change the birthday date or age and click on save.  you have a 390 page then maybe invite her to your pageThose are the only things you cant change
I don't see the problem. You just click on a question that is IN VOTING. Then read the question and scroll down through the answers. When you find the one you think is correct (if it is a factual question) or the one whose opinion you agree with (if it is an opinion question), then just click on VOTE FOR THIS AS BEST ANSWER.. . If you hate all the answers and don't feel comfortable voting for any then just click on NO BEST ANSWER.. . That is all there is to it. I don't see why you are confused.All you have to do is go to the undecided answers and check the one you want with a thumbs up.  That's all to it, it worked for me.Click on Vote, Click on a question, Click Vote for an answer you like.You can give a question and answer a thumbs up or thumbs down (rating).  I believe this equates to a vote.. . Once the time to answer has expired and the asker does not pick a best answer, the decision goes to others in the form of a vote button.  There will be a Vote As Best Answer link at the bottom of each answer, and a No Best Answer link at the very bottom of the list.  You simply click the link by the answer you think is best.Check the thumbs up or thumbs down icon. Or you can go to Resolved questions and choose the best answer to the question asked.First...you must qualify for being able to vote.   You qualify by writing a specified number of answers to questions.. . Everytime you answer a question you collect 2 points.  Until you answer enough questions, you can click on the thumbs up or down and will get no response.
See right where it has a thumbs up and down well at the very end of that line is a cross. move your mouse over it and it will show little things on it and press the 1 that says extend question or something like it and when you 1st do it, it will extend to 7 daysYou have 3 days, after the first 48 hours.the most you can extend it for is 48 hours, so that questions can be resolved.LOL

Go to http://www.Yahoo.com or Yahoo member directory in search & type in there name weather yahoo id or real name that should do the trick. Have a good day!Member search directory doesn't work anymore, I have been round and round with several people from Yahoo Inc. and they say they know the problem and are working on it, that was over a month ago, since then I have found that there are lots of little things that were core yahoo that doesn't work anymore like trying to do a search from here (http://classifieds.yahoo.com/index.html?tab=personals). I think yahoo has tried to do to many things in too many directions and lost direction of what made them great to begin with and now they are losing my attention, and I have started to look else ware on the net for a place to call homeI tried the suggested method given in the first response to your question but a message came up saying "this page cannot be shown" What does work is to go to Search for Questions and enter "profile of ...." - give person's nickname. So in my case you would enter Mukunda M.. Then select Advanced search and a page comes up with questions asked by Mukunda M. You click on that and get profile page of Mukunda M. Make sure you use the full nickname as many are similar

Lately I eliminate any where the spelling is so atrocious that even if you answered them it's doubtful they could comprehend it so why bother?I usually just glance through the main list of questions on the home page, and then just choose the ones that jump out to me as far as my interests. Also ones that I know I know the answers to I try to answer, or ones that are interesting (such as a opinion question), or questions that I find unique - like this question here. <:o)I'm just an asshole.I just look at the new ones...sometimes the related questions to the new ones! Anything i can answer i will i need the points hahaI just look for new ones and keep refreshing the page! (sad addict =/ shame faced) If I know the answer but 10 people have already given it I won't answer it cos it would bug me if I were the person receiving all those emails that say the same damn thing!Answer the ones you know the correct answer ...Questions I know I can answer, ones that require a sensible &  serious answer, new ones, old ones, any category, especially if they leap out at you & make you want to answer them.I usually just Refresh the main page and answer the ones I like best.Mostly look at new ones, and then look at the suggested questions underneath. Sometimes look in subjects I'm intersted in.I look at the latest ones and answer those I think I can give a sensible and helpful reply to or if it is a silly question sometimes a silly replypersonally speaking, i answer only those that i honestly know. dont want 2 make up answers, & pretend i know what im talking about. most of the time, only those that interests me... sometimes the intriguing ones. Most especially those asking for opinions, not exact factual answers. Questions that dont require high wisdom, but simply WIT. . but if you're into academic questions, it surely is a good exercise for the brain to entertain tough questions. besides, it's a win-win situation all the time. if u answer it correctly, that 1derful. but it's also equally rewarding to know how much good questions people can come up to. some of them would even interest you to research.. so you Learn too.Favourite category and something that looks sensible and interesting.I just read the interesting ones and look for some new ones.I go back and forth from specific categories to general open questions...I answer if I have experience with the subject.I look at the new ones mainly then keep refreshing the page. Occasionally I'll go into different subjects of interest and I'll answer the ones I feel strongly about or (think) I know something about.I usually go on my favourite categories and look for my favourite people to answer, if they aren't on, I answer the questions that sort of pop out and look interesting...

Member made chatrooms don't exsist anymore because a lot of people abused that. Some for good purposes some for illegal and disgusting purposes. Nonetheless Yahoo decided to remove that ability to create our own chatrooms. Ooo well when one person ruins something it ruins it for all of us.The ability to create chatrooms has been disabled, due to users creating adult chatrooms that could be accessed by minors.
right clicking on the picture and then in the block below choose JPEG and where you want the picture to be saved. Always use the SAVE ASYou can open the file in Paint and Save As that way, however, i find that the quality goes way down when changing from anything to anything in Paint, your best bet, to keep quality, is to use a Photoshop-like tool (Or Photoshop itself, if you have it), and save it that way. This site might also help. Scroll down to the Image Converters part of the site. I myself frequently use IrFanView.The easiest way, if you're using Microsoft Wondows XP, is to open the picture in "Paint", then from the file menu choose "save as", and select jpg as your save option.Put the picture in paint....if it is already in paint then just go to save as. . the go to file type. . JPEG. . that easy :)go to save-as when u save it and scroll down the the jpeg when u save under where u can name itOpen the picture in a program like Paint or any image software.. Go to "file' and then "save as" then below where you name it click the drop down menu and you will have choices like .bmp. or .jpg or .jpeg. Name it. Select .jpg and click ok. . Make sure you know where you saved it to, like "my documents" or "my pictures". . You will be a pro in no time at all :)open in photoshop and go to save as. Select jpeg as the file format.
be careful with that adverts. what it does, it will use your system resources so it slows down whatever you are doing. better get a pop up blocker.Hi,. Because the page is busy.  Until the ad loads you have to wait.. bjsThe ad is probably loaded with all kinds of stuff that the security settings of your computer are scanning - thereby delaying the download.

good question i also want to know how to delete that status msg..thanx in advance!!!I don't think that particular status message can be deleted but you can click on the one you want up there like "available", "not at my desk" or "be right back." The new status message is something that you can use again when needed, but you can't delete it.Try right-clicking it and then deleting it. I haven't used msgr in a while so I don't know for sure about the new one.. . Edit: I just remembered that when you create a new status msg one of the others you created is automatically deleted since you only get a certain number spaces for customizable msgs.
If you see her name in blue (St Helena woman, right), then click on it.. You will see her profile, and to the right of it you will see 'e-mail'. Click on that. then you will get a form to fill in, her address is already known to yahoo, and they will send it for youMaybe there aren't any computers there.You probably have the wrong address, check it out and make sure your spellings are correct and all dots and dashes are in the correct places.The problem could either be the email address itself , the settings of mail filters or technical problems on the other side(st helina).Check if the email address is spelt correctly and try again.If it still fails then it could be due to the other reasons.because you need to learn how to spell. Helena is spelled wrong- its St Helena not st helina.

what do you mean by saying header border pic ? you mean banner ?Ask Yahoo about itWhen you are signed in to yahoo and visiting your 360 MY PAGE, there is CUSTOM EDIT / CHANGE THEME. For background, you can fill most with a large 1000x600 and tile so repeats the length of page. You can find an interesting banner like MARVEL COMICS wallpaper and split the horizontal comic action into a top and bottom banner. 1000x300 for bottom and 1000x210 for top. You want to create your banners in jpg. format. In photoshop, choose OPTIMIZE for WEB when assigning jpg to your finished product. This should be small enough to meet the yahoo protocol.. . Consider the banner and image is going to be blocked by modules. If you notice on the themes made by yahoo for 360, an interesting graphic lies above the center line or horizon and the lower is color and texture. You want your primary graphic kept close to top of banner.. . As you scroll past the background change options, you see all the elements of modules and borders and profile background, etc. It takes several tries to get the COLOR tweaks blending well with your new background. I have a BLOG ROLL with two real handy links easily tagged 360 COLOR TIPS. On is an excellent review of one websites color schemes at a time.

Well, one way is to just not check your e-mail for a while  cause if you don't check it for about a month or so it will just close it's self.simply stop using it,,,,eventually they will close it as a inactive account.It depends on who is providing you with that address. Some of them can be contacted and asked to close down the address, some have an automated feature on their website to close down an account and some cannot do it. It's really up to your email provider. Most people wouldn't care about closing down an address - they just stop using it...If you donot open or operate the email for 90 days continuously,it wll be automatically deactivated in most cases.

Go to your open question, to the tool bar underneath. The pencil should have the option to "Send To Voting". However, it is "more polite" to pick a best answer yourself.

Hi, . Yahoo is experiencing problems until they finish updating the new format which will be completed at the end of this month. I got that information off of the mail help pages. Most any issue regarding mail or sign-in is due to the glitch. It applies to both Betaq and standard mail These things address mail but apply to most all problem!!! . . Here are a few things that are helping people in the meantime:. http://wap.oa.yahoo.com/. For different areas of Yahoo!. . For those who can't get in at all try this as it seems to be working for a few.. http://myyahoo.com. Login on My Yahoo! page. Select the link at top right to go to Yahoo!'s Home Page.. Mouse over the Mail Icon under where it says (Hi, your Yahoo! id).. You should get a drop down menu with your latest emails displayed.. Select an email and click it. You then get to a new page about Shortcuts, but just select the button for Mail and it should take you to your Mail page.. It wasn't getting redirected to the shortcuts page on some servers and not going to the mail page.. . This is working for some:On the Options page, in the "Management" column, click on "General Preferences". . Find the "Composing E-mails" section, "Mode:", and choose "Compose messages as plain text". . Scroll to the bottom and click the "Save" button. . Now try it. Can you Compose, Reply to a message or . Click the "Options" link in the upper right of your Mail page. . Forward? . . This is working for some also:. Make sure your screen resolution is 1024 by 768 pixels. Right click on your desktop, click Properties, click the "Settings" tab, left click and hold on the screen resolution bar and drag it all the way to the right, click Apply and . click OK.. Hope one or all of these things help you.Well, if you want someone to give you an answer it would be really helpful if you could tell us exactly what the error message says. The more details you give in your question the more likely you will get an answer to your problem. Thank you.Stop trying to send messages until you fix the problem.  I'm sure the error tells you where to go to fix it or atleast tells you the error being caused.  There may be an error number or code, goto your help menu in the program that has the error and look up that error code or trouble shooting.
Well, it's better than the folks who's answer is "Thanks for the two points!" (I've seen that.). . Sometimes, it may be a persons short hand way of letting you know they don't think you should be involved.. . I don't really know, most of the time, I write too much!To get the points.some are real some is to get pointsjust points. . . they don't want to burn their brain cells in answering your question and not be selected as best answer. for them, 2 pts is better than giving an effort for 10.. . . . . . .They're just looking to add to their point totals.  However, you get some good & sincere answers also if you word the question correctly & wait until there's some useful answers.Wow that's weird, I just got a really pointless, like duh, response and was just thinking a similar thought when i ran across this question. I often wonder if people just answer to get these points you cant do a thing with. I really would rather have no answer than a half baked one, personally.I don't know. . Maybe they are so thick, as to really think that is an opinion, or helpful. Most of the time when I see that, I think they are probally just really young. . Also, why do people post questions and then not bother to pick a best answer? Do they forget or what????
in the messenger toolbar go to . messenger &#92; my account info . a page will open write your old password and the new password you want to activeYour messenger password is the same as your yahoo mail/account password.. In your yahoo mailbox, look at Options. That page would give you mechanisms to edit your account settings including passwords.. . cheerz.open Messenger,. click on FORGOT PASSWORD and fill out that form it throws on the screen....
you lose 5 points for ever question you ask. I doesn't matter how thoughtful or practical they areYou lose points with every question you ask.U use 5 points after u ask  question, the points are just to level how good u are at mainly answering questions and how many u answer. Maybe ur asking more than u are answering. Try to answer more than u ask.It cost 5 points to ask a question. If you pick the best answer on your question  you will get 3 back. The best way to accumulate points is to answer questions the best you can. You get 2 points for answering and 10 points for being the best.
( Alt +C )  or A Star or Alt or Tools  > Put check mark beside MENU BAR.the yellow star is favorites.     go to start,settings,,control panel... add/remove programs.high lite IE7,click remove.it will go back to IE6
Yes.  You can get a new email address with another provider, or another email address with the same provider.  You can set up automatic forwarding from your current address to your new address so that you won't miss out on any messages sent to your current address.. . If you shared your current provider (the name after the @ in your email address) then it might be easier to help you.No, if you want a different email address, you need to sign up for a new one.
It is not dumb, why do you say that?Obviously, it is you that is stupid because you think that a computer program is or can be dumb.  When in fact, a computer program can only be stupid!. . Dumb people cannot speak and stupid people cannot think.Maybe it's the mechanic and not the tool...i dunno. i think its coz its really deaf. wwwoh really I think he is deafYahoo Meesenger is not dumb its just ment for people who like to talk. Its really no different from a phone except you type on one and you just talk on the other. If you have voice on yahoo messenger its really no different from the phone you even sometimes get to see the other person on webcam or their picture!! So dont call it dumb just call it a different kind of phone!!. . 1,. Nashmonee?
Just find one of their questions/answers and click on their avatar.. Scroll down and you can see their past Q&A.. Or, if you readily don't have one of their questions or answers to hand, do you see that green bar about a quarter of the way down?  On the right hand side of the page, it says 'Advanced', just before 'My Q & A'.  Click on 'Advanced', and type the name of the person you want to find, tell it look for it in 'Nicknames of Users' and see what comes up.  You'll be able to find them from that.click on their avatar and you will be able to view thisClick on their picture boxes or the IDs below the picture box.i just go to answer question and i get to view other questionsYou click on their avatar. Itll take you into their Q & A.If you can find their avatar, you can click on thatClick there name and you will view their Yahoo Answers profile, from there you can view the answers, questions and best answers..just like you can if you view your own name.
I believe you are using the new yahoo photo version. Click on the photo you want to view so that it is in larger size view. There is a download button, click on it. In the download page, there is a Photo Details section that show the information of the photo taken from.Here's what I think happens. When sharing photos while using messenger you can right click to save one. If you select "Save to my  computer" it goes to your hard drive, if you select "save in Yahoo" I think they get saved in "mail attachments". That may be where your strays may be coming from.
http://milliondollarzhomepage.co.uk/htmlinstruction2.html. . Go here look at the codes then play! good luckIf you are just starting out, try yahoo geocities, it has a builder  to help you and can get a site done quite fast. After that you could try Dreamweaver and programs such as that. I find Netfirms free hosting quite good.I personally like Freewebs the best to start out with; they have pre-made layouts for you to use and then later on, you can upgrade to HTML if you'd like.   Bravehost is another good one, but I personally think too many ads.
Probably, because it requires some solicitation.  But honestly, asking some different dinner dishes, is innocuous. Lately, Yahoo has a lot of changes.  One of them is the deletion of answers.  There's no rhyme  not  good reason for any of their new actions.  They want you to use this site as question and answer forum.  No Spam, advertisement,etc.All I can say...is there are some mean ppl out there. Reporting others for lame reasons. Your question was a great one. Sorry it was removed.cause ppl are mean and like to report stuff instead of just answering and getting points they just waste their time reporting stuff.Might as well ask why the sun rises in the East and sets in the West. There are just lots of people on this website that like to report folks for no reasons and yahoo doesn't care, they accept the complaints at face value and don't even read the questions that are being cited for violations.They probably considered that chatting. Kinda like they felt my question about what Dr Phil was about on Friday was considered chatting.
Right click on the group name and there is an option to send to all in the group.. . Oh, and those im's you get that say send to everyone on your list is actually crap - don't waste your time sending the message on.she's correct on the how....but be VERY VERY careful what you send to your contacts....just b/c it came from a frnd doesnt mean they actually sent it...make sure they actually sent it you.... . most common one i see is one that says to check something out on GEO-CITIES....when you click on it...it ends up sending that same msg to all your contacts and then its bounced around all over
Perhaps someone opened up your password? I think someone did for me, and I have a feeling I know who...but I got it back with the recover password thing you see each time you log in.Are you using the correct user name/password?

To add to watchlist  go to your PLUS sign icon and click the ADD TO WATCHLIST icon.
WHATEVER ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT. I ALWAYS USE CAPS BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO GO LOOKING FOR MY GLASSES ALL THE TIME AND NO ONE HAS  REPORTED ME................... GOOGLE HAS A SITE LIKE THIS???  WHAT'S THE ADDRESS.?  THANKSAw!  Don't give up.  Those things are nothing.  You just don't understand how it works and some of the guidelines.  We want you here.  It's really a great site.lets all go 2 the confusion couch  >>> never heard about hours left.. left 4 what ? will the sky fall then ? do we have 2 help pick it up  : )  it's not yahoo thats doing you in,, it's the people on here that are reporting us all 4 silly stuff.. bare down and hang with us  : )Yahoo! will send you reminders about your question until you close it by selecting the best answer.. . By the way, I just posted the answer to that one for you.. . Good luck!what? im confusedyahoo hates youget over it
I really have nothing to say that can help, all we can do is hope that they may make a few changes to it to help us, but with yahoo I seriously doubt it. Trust me I am very angry myself. Good LuckHere's what happened: They've been inexplicably replaced by a slower, more useless version, with LESS information, no apparent way to filter by listing type, and no explanation of the change from what seemed perfectly useful or any option to view listings in the old, far superior format. Albeit there is a shiny new look. For a listing service that doesn't suck, try TV Guide.
Click on Messenger in the Menu Bar area and then on My Contact Details. Put your ID in the nickname area or first name area.go to file, prefrences and there is a section there

(note remember most things can be deleted by useing the right click feature.next time you have to delete something use that option first it may be there.
Tralalalala U smell nice I luf Nancy Allen thats me im not vainYou need to have your friends in your address book. That way they will get to your inbox.they are not from your friends chances are a a spy site tracker usually found on bebo and such has got their names and using them to try and rope you into viruses.. aren't you the person who asked people why he gets porn pop ups on his pc earlier ????Just add your friends email addresses to your contacts and then they shouldn't go in junk folder. If they do you have a problem with your computer

find a phone number, it might get you to a real person, but im not sure.... . why dont you just ask your question here?. . how about you just e-amil me, and maybe i can answer your question..... . Cheekee_monkee_81893@yahoo.com. . please. thanks. byeHere are a couple of numbers that other folks have given me...have not tried them yet as I am in Mexico and  it costs me more to call them.  But...they certainly do not answer their emails!  so here they are...408-349-1572   or 1-866-562-7219.  Good luck!I thinki you have to contact them by e--mail or checking their data base to resolve it. Yahoo is a free service supported by Ad, it is not likely you can talk to a person. If you ISP is Yahoo/AT& T you may get a human support.lol, you make it sound like there aren't any more humans left, well to speak to a "human" you need to get their number from the source bellow.

It does.  When you check your spelling, a little box pops up on the right with suggestions.Because "Miss" is a word and so is "spelled" therefore the online dictionary believes you are spelling two different words correctly. It doesn't know you are trying to spell "misspelled".
i keep signing in to yahoo messeanger my smiley will not wake upI think he's really tired. It's just been one of those days. Really, you should check something with your internet or troubleshoot messenger.You have a connection issue with Yahoo messenger.. . That happens to me from time to time.. . Solution: Log out of messenger and shut down the computer. wait 30 or more seconds and start up again.. . If that does not work. Re-install Yahoo messenger. I de-install all of Yahoo and do a Complete re-install. About 30 mins. time is involved.. . Works for me.. . Good LuckTry reinstalling the messenger. Hopefully it shall solve your problem.you are in invisible mode. go to status then available. 10 pts?I have even reinstalled my messenger and still have the same problem. It worked for about a week and, I can't sign in again(?) Someone had mentioned that my firewall is causing the disconnection(?) YOU WOULD THINK - with so many people having this problem, Yahoo would try to fix this problem. At least give us some more info or something!!!

It hasn't worked for a long time.  Welcome to the wonderful world of Yahoo!. . Good Luck!it has not worked for a long time
you don't. Why don't you just email people privately and send them. Do not share with the world because I am sure that less then 1% really want to see you.You should use Yahoo Photo Albums to share your Adult Oriented photos with your friends.  You can choose exactly who can view these photos instead of submitting them globally and running the risk of having your 360 shut down.
First off, start by installing Y!IM and then make a name and what not. Then, just start adding people from there. Click on contactsGo to yahoo.com and click on messenger and sign on!! Add your friends and start chatting. It is that simple if you have any questions write me back.

Because that's not a question that will help Yahoo users who come to Yahoo Answers in the future.. . You could rephrase it and make it ok, probably.  For example, "What are popular dinner foods in American homes?"  That would go through.It's considered chatting (I think it's a silly rule, personally). . Fried chicken cutlets, mashed potatoes and baby carrots.I asked a question and it was removed, . I asked what are you guys doing tonight and and told what i was doing and it was removed right away. I did not understand why either. To answer you question I had a pizza calzone it was very good.Cuz some jerk reported it. Someone just surfing thru the questions, they saw yours and got a thrill when they did it. . . Youre just another victim. Sorry it happened to you too. You lost points and didnt deserve it. . . Thumbs up from me....BTW...I had Subway for dinner.a chicken salad saladbecause it's a conversational question, not an actual question.because if you go by their guidelines, it is not a questionThat question is considered chatty.  Check out the guidelines for more info.  ?Too chatty, I believe.because it was personalBecause its not a appropriate question for Yahoo to keep on the questions listIt sucks they took it down...to answer your question, I'm having nachos. They're delicious.it wasn'tAsk it in Polls category.. . The question is considered "chat" which isn't what this site is for.. . You see worse things that havent been removed (yet) -- report them.
There are alot of Anna's in this world. If she was your girlfriend, then she should have already given it to you.Ask Anna's friends
Go to messenger at top of friends chat list, click on My details, type in your name or nick name then click save and close button.I believe it has to be changed in your Yahoo profile.  Login and go to "My Account".
If it's to yahoo.  Then go to Start, Run, type in msconfig.. from there go to the startup tab, and untick yahoo messenger.. reboot, and that should be gone.Go to "Messenger" in upper left corner of your Messenger IM. Choose "Preferences", then choose "Category"...General.  Be sure the box is empty where it says "when I start my computer automatically start Yahoo! Messenger."Please be specific as to what are you signing onto?????
The fix.. 1). Log into Yahoo! Messenger.. 2). Click on Messenger.. 3). Click on My Contact Details.. ~If you want to have your First Name only, delete your Last name.. ~If you want to use the Nickname field, delete your First and Last name and enter the name you would like to see in the IM box in the Nickname field.. ~If you want only your Account ID to show, leave all fields blank.. 4). Always click Apply and OK when making any changes.. . The reason...... you probably signed up for a Yahoo! Messenger Account using your First/Last name.  They will show in the IM window when you send an IM or receive an IM from another user, unless you change it.    . . That does not mean the other person you are chatting with can see your First/Last name. Your Contact Details must be sent to them. If you have not sent your Contact Details to the other person you are IMing with, they will see your Yahoo! Account Name (or Nickname) and not your First/Last Name. . . If you have previously sent your Contact Details to the other person, they will need to delete you from their list and re-add you in order for you name to change on their list.. . For addition explanation and information go to http://www.chatauthority.com/changename. http://www.chatauthority.com/editcontactinfo. . You may also need to edit Account Information..... . Click on My Account on any Yahoo! Page you have just signed into (at the top of the page under your Yahoo! ID).  Sign in and go down to the Address/Contact Information Section.  Click on Edit.  First and Last name fields MUST be filled in but you can change them to anything you would like.  Click Finish.Click on Messenger in the menu bar and then on My Contact Details. Put whatever you want to be shown in one of the boxes.The answer is 42
Look at how many silly answers you get. Do we want that many silly questions?Because you are at Level 1. Read the Yahoo Answers page to find out how many points you have to have to answer all day long. I have about 7,000 points and I spend about an hour and a half answering questions.Thats just the way Yahoo has it set up. Its a game. You gotta earn the privleges. It sux, but youll get to where you can answer all you want , once you get to a higher level.
What Laura and Joey said.... . But if you can't remember their user name, check your message archives until you recognize them or a conversation.  You must have the Messenger Arcive function activated to do this. . . You can also check your email address contacts in Yahoo Messenger.  They are not automatically deleted when you delete a user name.  In Messenger, go to "Contacts" at the top and scroll to "Show Address Book"  Your deleted friend could still be in there.. After you locate the name, just go through the "add contact" procedure again.. . .Click the Contacts menu and select Add a Contact. If you know their Messenger ID, you can add it. If not, and you have their email address, you can select it from your Address Book.What Laura said, or just leave your yahoo messenger on all the time, and they will send you a message- next time you are on, capture their sn.
Because his questions made no sense and were often under the wrong category.. . But gosh you know what? I'm so mad at Y!A over the stupid violation I got today that I think I should follow in his footsteps.It happens alot - and I think there is more than one.  You can tell the imposters.Do you have to ask?Potentially for cloning or impersination, as it;s not the Original oneBecause he got reported on several occasions.Geez, it seems so clear to me.
It's easy, but not obvious:. . Right click on your desktop, pick 'new' and 'shortcut' and you'll be directed to input the URL, then the title.  And that's it!go to "all programs" rightclick on hotmail icon,choose from menu "send to" choose desk top!Rt click your mouse when it's on the Hotmail page...it will say among other thing's "create shortcut" click on create shortcut  that should do it
I know how you can get it in here....write yahoo like i did about BOATS they entered a new category for boats after I wrote to them a few times.... so try it, and maybe they can look up your answers and see how many people want this. I want this new category put in..and I bet others do also..... good luck. smileIf your metaphysical  questions are being answered, why?. If not, why?
If you suspect somebody is trying to use your password then change it straight away. Generally you should change your password every couple of weeks anyway for security.i change mine every dayYou can't check. There is no failed login attempt tracker, nor does Yahoo tell you when you last logged in.. . Assuming you are talking about Yahoo on-line accounts.
I bet the person who wrote the question reported you for "gaming" (as in, "Thanks for the two points."). . I'm guessing they had both motive and opportunity.It's not you it's whoever gave you the violation.  I see curse words, all kinds of stuff.  I got one myself for rolling my eyes at a joke.. Go figure.. Guess if you might not like the answer - don't ask the question.. Grow up is what I'd tell them.
Nope, there are plenty of unresolved ones out there to vote on. Just don't click on "Show Me Another", cause they go in date order and seem to be showing resolved ones again. Once you vote, just click on the BACK arrow twice to return to the list of the questions and choose the next question yourself!you're right that there are pages and pages of resolved questions in the unresolved categories.  It's very frustrating and I gave up earlier.  It's a choice these days of voting and receiving no points or having the points but not being able to find questions to resolveim going to have nightmares about your avator for the rest of my lifeNOTE TO ALL BODY SNATCHERS - there's another one screeeeaam!I had that problem this morning when I was trying to get some votes in. But I guess I have to thank my lucky stars because I could actually vote and receive points. All of yesterday and Saturday I could vote but I wasn't receiving any points.
If you are chatting with someone, click the plus sign on the message box to add them.. . If you know the screen name of those you want to add, click the plus sign on your Yahoo! Messenger and put their screen name in the line.when you're talking to some one jus click add this person and there you go but they have to accept your invitation otherwise you won't have them on your messenger
u need to go under the profile setting and change your nameMy IM shows the profile that I have set up for that purpose.  Try setting up an additional profile that uses a nickname and set it as your default.Because you have it set to appear that way.  I have mine set to only display my first name.If you don't want to appear your name, go to Yahoo!Mail and then to "My account" and change your name if it is possible.. Thanks.it will always show your full name on YOUR end, the other person is seeing your nickname dont worry.i hope that my answer is the best one   so if   it is really helpful to you then don't forget to give me the best answer award. ok its deal. here is your solution    . first of all go to yahoo messenger's main window. then go to messenger->my contact details. then just change your nickname and add new      save it. . .  2  but if u want to edit your profile so public can see only what do you allow to see them then in messenger->got to my profile and change it  . . but i think the first one will work for you. bye
Go to the Internet Explorer Tool Bar at the top; select Tools.  It will be right there.. . You are better off keeping it blocked with the blocker set to notify you when one is blocked.

YOU WILL SEE OPEN/CLOSE POP UP BLOCKER.on your browser,go to tools then on the drop down,choose pop up blockers then it should give option turn on or turn off.Right-click the pop-up blocker icon, and uncheck "enable pop-up blocker".
it is like you have a website open and you press add tab and you can open another website and still save your other one saved on. its just like 2 internet explorers in one!!!Geez, thanks for asking the question and thank you to the people that answered.  I learned something I did not know.it lets you view more sites in the same window in which you were viewing the original site. Each tab shows a page from one site and you can switch between sites or between multiple pages from the same site
On the top of any yahoo page, click on "My Account" (make sure you are logged in first). Then on the top look where it says "Change your password" click on it then just do the steps and you should be able to change your password.hold down Ctrl and Alt and hit   Del to get windows security  window, and then click Change Password....   . You have to enter your old/current password, and then enter a new one twice.. If you don't use have a password right now, set a password for yourself first, and then change it if you want.

You can't change your e-mail, you have to make another one. That's why you get sent to that page.Why would you want to change your Email address,, your Email then would go somewhere else instead of going to you,but you do have a choice of Email address providers such as Yahoo , MSN , NTL ,BT, the list is endless, then choose a suitable password with about eight letters and numbers a mix if you like for example ABC123DE, good luck. oh and never ever tell anyone your password OK.Get a new one- and start from the beginning, theres no point stressin over iti just cant understand why i cant send a message
No, it means it wasn't sent.  Your email program tried everything it could do to send it, but wasn't able to do soAll it means is that yahoo could not send the e-mail to the person you meant to receive it. This could be for several reasons.(i.e wrong e-mail address (check your typing) or that yahoo's mail system was down or something). Best to keep trying. I hope it wasn't an emergency e-mail! To avoid this problem its best to keep a copy in draft format so you can go back and look at it and attempt to send it again.It means that the person you sent it to either does not exist (you made an error in the address) or their server is rejecting their emails (either because their mailbox is full or because the server is down). Try it again in an hour or so.. . good luck!It did not arrive, maybe you did not get the address right. Try again and check the address carefullyNo, it did'nt arrive where it was sent to, in other words it died. So in future take more care of your emails and feed them properly.
Just go to Control panel > add/remove programmes>click on IE 7.0 > click remove. . Dont worry your good old IE 6.0 will remain & function well.The control panel add/remove programs option should uninstall IE7 however, the early beta version of IE7 requires a special uninstall program available from Microsoft at:. http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=671baf16-52a3-410c-85a8-931ea6de5ff8&displaylang=enyou dont have to remove any thing from your stupid computer you should buy a new oneGo to your computers control panel and then click add/remove programs.  Find Internet Explorer and uninstall it.  It will automatically revert back to the IE you had before you installed IE 7
Just log out thats all you can doyou cant terminate just your Y!A account. you would have to delete your entire Yahoo account. Just stop logging into here.You cant terminate the account. All you can do is delete anything that might still be open and just dont log back in. Yahoo holds everything for some reason. I would think with some time and it not being used, Yahoo will eventually delete the account.
This happened to me too and I had the 8.0. Go to google and search for Yahoo! Messenger 7.0 and choose a free install. You need to uninstall yor 7.5 first though. I used the link below but I think you can select any of them. Yahoo is having difficulty with some of the servers for newer versions of Messenger.. . http://downloads.zdnet.co.uk/0,1000000375,39128387s,00.htmi had this problem for a while. does your computer have firewall.or security software that would be the problem. mine was firewall problems

You can delete your answer only while a question is still "open." Once the question goes into voting or has been resolved, you can no longer delete your answer. Think about it, if users could delete all their answers that didn't win "best answer," then everyone could give themselves a 100% best answer percentage.If the questions are still open, then you can go to the question and click on the pencil icon, and select edit/delete.. . If the questions are resolved, then you cant delete them. Yahoo will not let us. They hold them for some weird reason.. . Ive even reported myself, and asked them to remove one of mine. They took 10 of my points and never replied to me.I don't think so.  You will always see the questions you have answered.  There is no way to "clear the slate".of course you can do that..go to your profile or simply click on your names appears left of the page and frm there you can check your answers and can delete those who dont want for vote you can also see your question and best answer you will get all option there..enjoy!!
Yahoo is a horrible company, thats why.Yahoo seems to be doing a rather large upgrade right now.  So just be patient and keep trying. . E

You might find someone in a forum somewhere who might edit the picture for you.  I wish I could be more help ...Unless you have some really good imaging software, then you are out of luck.  Its not that simple to make that drastic of a change.. . Good Luck!
Sometimes it seems not worth the waste of points and effort with some of you guys.  Fun to watch though.I already know everything I need to know.. . CoachIn general, people are always welcome to pass some comments on you but they don't let u point ur their weakness. They can make the same thing positve and negative. . . Talking of this website/service pople don't want to waster their point . They like to point out cons and hide thier consOne earns point by answering and loses points by asking!Most of the information I seek can be found with a google search.. . i ask questions that I cannot find an answer to, so i use the site to help me.I asked a few, but never got the degree of answers that I expected.  What was odd was that all the answers were the same and wrong.  How can you pick a wrong answer as being the best?  And you have to select one or loose the reward.A.) they have not come across anything they don't need, or desire to know.. b.) They enjoy helping others, like myself.they probably do but from another email address you never knowgreetings. Could it be that their psychology is so dependant on the "known" that the "unknown" - any of an infinite number of answers different from their own, would unsettle their sense of safety and security ?. . By the way, a very weak Catch 22they don't like to waste points or they don't want to ask anything!Some of us that don't ask alot of question's.We have learned how to search in different search area's and find what we  want.Other's can't figure why all the pc,s have those search block's.They would rather ask d questions.
junk mail buttonon the left side of your screen (if your using yahoo) it says bulkleft column in yahoo mail inbox.  Either trash or spam.. E

hmm...u can do it using the software "funphotor"... basically, u can use Paint. just open the first picture in paint then paste ur dad's face in it also. then clik the dashed rectangle right next to the star on the left side of paint window. u can find 2 rectangles below the elipse and rounded rectangle on the pane..clik the bottom rectangle... if this is very ahrd 4 u to do, u can use softwares like a mentioned above.. yeah..u can also get help from a graphic designer...=).... i hope i helped u in any way...I've used Adobe Photoshop.  . . I'm not aware of any free software or site that you can go to.  If you find one let us all know.Using photo editing software such as Adobe Photoshop or Corel Photopaint, you will crop a photo around your Dad's face and using the eraser tool, erase the background details so everything other than your Dad's face (or head) is transparent. You can then import this image into other photos, drag it into place, resize it to fit then flatten the image.. . If you prefer to hire a skilled photo editor, you could have this done at any photography studio that does digital editing (which is often more affordable than hiring a freelance graphic artist/designer)First get some photo editing software. Try Photoshop. You then can take your mouse, outline the face yourself and then copy and paste it onto another photo. Its easy.
Unfortunately, I don't think that you can.  There is no "trash bin" for contacts.  There is no way to recover them once deletedGo to file at the top of your left hand screen and click on recently deleted mail.In time as the people email you click on "Add to Address Book" by their address.

This might not be quite what you are looking for but i would go to tools, internet options and where it says homepage put a different one in to yahoo such as . . http://www.msn.com/. or. http://www.content.overture.com/d/you got yahoo toolbar with ie7 included. ther are still compatability issues with ie7. revert back and wait for these to be resolved. hope this helps.Just go to control pannel and then into add/remove software and uninstall IE7 and follow instructions.You should try re-installing Internet Explorer 7, from Microsoft this time, not from Yahoo!, and then try rolling it back to 6 again. Whatever you do, do NOT uninstall Internet Explorer from your PC.
I know.  All I wanted was a beard and no luck.  What's up with that?I find that they all look the same!  None of them look over 25.Because it would make sense Pixy!  Does Yahoo do anything that ever makes sense?  . . I'm with you!  Maybe they should stop spending time deleting good Q&A and spend more time on making the avatars more user friendly!just put a cap on your avatar and give them a close up to hide the legs:)Not funny...I agree, they all look young anyway.If it really bothered you, you could upload your own userpic.i dont know. but you should request them to have bald.    avatars. so you can feel more comfortable about having.       one.
your wit them FOREEVER  HOEYou can delete all of your stuff and make it private, but you can't completely cancel a 360 page unless you completely delete your Yahoo ID as well.Just delete everything on the page and click save. You cant get rid of the page. You can also make sure its set on Private.Unfortunately, you cannot delete a Yahoo! 360 account. It's linked to your primary Yahoo! ID. If you want to keep your Yahoo! ID for things like Mail, IM, Answers, etc. then you'll need to hide your 360.. There are a few different ways to do this,. 1) Select the "Settings" option at the upper right of your 360 page and change all of you settings to 'Private'. This hides the majority of your content, if someone stumbles onto your page.. 2) Perform option #1 and then select the first "Display Me As" option on the Settings page. Now your profile doesn't link to your 360 page. Also, UNcheck the "Activate Simple URL" setting and the "Friend Search" setting. This way people cannot guess your 360 page by sticking your yahoo id onto the end of 360.yahoo.com or searching for you by name or email address.. 3) Perform options #1 and #2 and then delete your friends by selecting the "My Friends" link in the upper right of your 360 page. Select "Edit Settings" on a friend's name, then select "Remove <friend> from your Friends Page". Finally, delete all of your content, blogs, links to pictures, lists, reviews, etc. This pretty much makes your 360 inaccessible and/or unusable by anyone who happens to get there.
I'm sure you probably did this, but when I couldn't get on my yahoo email, for my Id and pass I way putting my whole email address in for my ID and, I only needed my nickname part of it then my pass word.Are you getting an" invalid id or password" message?  Please reply back.  BillYahoo has been having loads of technical problems for quite a long time, last night on Answers, I had to tell about 40 people about it. It's been a mess, all kinds of error reports, email probs, photo, cams, messengers, cant sign on, you name it
You can't post a blog on your friends 360. You can only a blog on your own 360.You can only post your own blog on your page,but you can post comments on your friends blogs.Is that what you meant?You can post comments on other peoples blogs if their settings allow for it.But not actaul blogs on someone elses page or theirs on yours.
dont wear the boots dude!!Go to a shoe store, one that deals only in shoes and accessories. There is a stick-on pad that one can put inside shoes that will give a tighter fit around the heal.. Or, go to Dr.Lenard's website or Carol Wright. They sell all kinds of gadget for health and such. They will likely have something.Try the Corcoran (sp?) field boot...they look like jump boots but have tread on the bottom.  The sides are really soft and flexible so you can pull the laces really hard around your ankles....or you can try a pair of jungles (hot weather boots) they are just as flexible but aren't as comfortable.....I have the same problem....there are inserts that you stick to the back of your shoes the problem is getting your feet in the boots with out pulling them offHave you tried heel grip inserts?  Many shoe stores do not even know what these are.  They are just a thin strip that you put in your footware above your heel (where the dent is) to stop your heel from slipping.

yahoo are trying to tell you somethingI would say you hit the wrong tab. The tab to extend the question. Instead of email me new answers. They put them tabs so close together.
They are all still there, just hiddin.  Under Contacts on the menu, click once on empty groups and click once on offline contacts.  Both places should have a checkmark by them.. . If for some reason, empty groups is not highlighted, first uncheck offline contacts by clicking on it once.i think you have to add them all over again
You can do that if your account is Yahoo Mail Plus or Personal Address.  It was supported in free account some years ago but it was discontinued.. . Gmail provides support for POP for their email accounts.its easy... I did it...   Just go to Yahoo help and look for the POP mail help section and they will give you step by step instructions.  Print it out and follow it.   I am not particularly computer buff but I did it and like it.
when you're in the mail screen, click on Options on the far right.  you can then choose signature.I think it really depends on the letter your writing, I use my initials at the very in of the letter for a legal document, I usually write letters in word, so it is different but you can still use the guidelines, like at the end of a letter you can put,. . Sincerely,. . or you can print and have this space for your real signature. . Jane Marie Doe. 1396 Frankenstein St. Apt #8. Transelvania Tennesee. 66758 or whatever it is. . JMD                                 (JMD can be used as your signature)All you have to do is go into your yahoo email account and click on options at the top right hand side...then click on signature and set it up from there....make sure you save it when your done...I hope this helps...good luck =)
You have to have a picture on a Yahoo 360 site. Then on  your member page, you click on 'picture from 360 site' and it will make that picture your avatar. It's really annoying - for people like myself who don't want a 360 page!u cant. it just stays that way. i know. it sucks.
Because you have been a very naughty boy?!. . ;)can take time to show on answers list - other reason maybe that you are clicking on the back button to re-visit the page which doesn't show the updated answers. ok - that wasn't very clear which suggests that it's past my bedtime. g'nite all. ~x~they take 2 or 3 days to get on answers list
I don't really see any use i them! Because you can even give a good answer, and there is still someone who gives you thumbs down coz they disagree or they don't like you! So personally, i don't care about the thumbs!If it's a good answer you can give it thumbs up and if it's bad you can give it thumbs down. Only level 2 and above and it gives you one point when you vote.it means up if you think its a good answer and down if you think its notUp - Good Answer. Down - Not a good Answer. . But some people just put thumbs down because they don't agree with you, don't like your answer or generally for no apparent reason at all. I personally think it is a bit pointless unless used properly!!. . You can check yours by looking at your answers and questions in my Q&Ait means king bush and his side kick bliar are cross with youThumbs indicate whether people rate your answers and questions.  You can only see if you've received rates if you actually go back to check your answers and questions, although you will receive 1 point if someone thumbs up your best answers.You can vote for other people's answers and questions.. They get points for every thumbs up they get and obviously if people vote for yours, you get points.  Give them out generously, they are what makes answers great!!They're the difference between a christian martyr having a good day or Barbary lion having a better oneYou can use the thumbs up thumbs down thing on peoples questions and answers. Thumbs up=Good question/answer. Thumbs down=Bad question/answer.Its for voting a good or bad question/answer, as everyone else has poinited out.. . They can be used for members of level 2 and above.Thumb up means good answer thumb down means bad answerThumbs up means OK or good; thumbs down means bad or not acceptable.

I just checked the Answers en Espanol site and it appears that the database between English and Espanol are being shared.  Your Spanish questions are showing on the English site triggering people to report the non-English questions. This is just another one of the boo-boos that Y!A has been making lately that are contributing to the bad feelings from long-time users.I don't know, but I was answering a question in the Brazilian site and when I placed my answer, I got that "this question has been removed by Yahoo!... blah, blah ... see comuinity guidelines... blah blah". The most amazing was that the question was, roughly, something like: do you think there will be a solution to the violence problem in Brazil. Now, what guideline does that violate?Because you can report for any question and they will erase them. Also because you are not allowed to ask questions in another language. I think.
The time for that question had been extended to two weeks, which is why it hadn't gone to a vote yet. Yes, one-answer questions do go to a vote, but they only go to a vote against the "No Best Answer" option (no points for voting NBA).I wonder too now that you come to it! DANG. My vote quota just finished, Why do people always ask me to vote for something when my quota just finishes?
Doesn't work that way.Forget Yahoo Messenger in that case . . ... get some custom messaging programmes

MS Office has an "out of office" assistant built in.. . Check the options on your serviceSet the vacation repsonse by going to the mail options page. It should be a cinch.
I think they choose people randomly.  My yahoo homepage was changed, but I switched it back to the old version.  There should be a link on the front page giving you that option.kick the dog and slam the door ,that's what i did .. it didn't help though ,. . there is a complaint or suggestion link and you can vent your anger on a robot,here on the bottom . in -tell us what you think-. I told them and they thanked me for it ..  i believe these robots are masochists.Marketing.  Tell them your feelings and get everyone you know to do the same and tell them to tell everyone they know to do the same thing.I don't know why.  I don't like mine at all.  I'm used to the regular version better.  But it's weird cuz my friend's home page is still the same.  I just don't know.
Because no way are you a zero. Even after 44 seconds. :)because your stupidI'm guessing they were trying to make things less cluttered, but it is definitely a bit confusing since they've gotten rid of it. I keep thinking my questions have answers and then find out there's nothing when I go to check.  :(because someone answered the question, hence it has NOT 0 answers.I haven't post any question since last week, so I haven't face the zero theory, Lol.. I guess you are right. you get confused as if the answer has answers or not.It is possible that some users has asked them to delete it, so they tried to comply, or maybe a bug. I guess posting this question in the forum can clear a lot of thoughts and doubts.do you think they are saving a lot of space?it does still say it. at least for me it does, if i understand what youre asking.. like under your question, this is what it said:. "Asked by opifan64 - 0 answers - Yahoo! Answers - 2 minutes ago "That was one of the changes made last weekend when Answers was down.  It was a bit of a downer to see that zero, but now it seems like the words kind of run together.  We'll get used to it, Opi!!It does once in awhileI think this is a way of concealing lame-o questions like mine that never get many answers...yes, it was done to protect my pride specifically.
There have been a lot of requests for the feature and the team is looking into it but there isn't one available now. As mentioned above, you'll just have to remember how many you had answered before today started and subtract that from your total answers.yes go to homepage or click on ur own image, it will show Total no. of answers u have given, subtract yesterdays number n get todays remaining ans.. . For level 1 u can give 20 ans, for level 2 40 ans.....Go to your level. Click on the number. At the bottom of the page, it will tell you how much you are allowed to do based on the level you are at.count as u go along for a whole day and use that as ur estimate
I DOI don't think Yahoo allows your own hex codes for the blast just yet, if you choose to customize your theme... But if you choose from one of Yahoo's themes, they have layouts that have transparent blasts.. . The pages you've seen where the blast blends with the background must have picked backgrounds that are white, light to dark grey, or black.
He's probably hidingI haven't seen him at all lately! I don't know why he is still on here!
one time i asked "how old are you?" and it didn't like my detail of "tell the truth" so they sent me an email saying that they were deleating my question, and then they gave me a link to see what i did wrong.Well, I don't know what the question/answer was, but take a look at the community guidelines.b/c you make stupid comments, that sound racist. i think you know better than that. lie teller.
Nothing happens and you don't recieve any prize when recieving points. They're just there to let others, and yourself, know what kind of progress you are making. Everyone wants to see if you're good at answering questions or not.The points are mostly just an incentive for people to start answering questions, and also to vote on other answers, and finally, to rate other people's answers.. . Other than that, the points don't do anything. You do get some extra 'attention' at higher levels, but that may or may not be a good thing. There are no secret special prizes, at least none that any of us at Level 7 have heard of.. . Mostly, just enjoy the site, ask and answer questions. If you like, keep track of your points as you move up in levels. After awhile, you'll be more interested in responding to people's questions with quality answers.. . Here's the link where you can see what the different levels are and how to earn points. http://answers.yahoo.com/info/scoring_system. . Welcome to the site!u feel good. that's something a little difficult to come by, don't you think??your computer will EXPLODE!!!!!!!!!. jk it's just 4 funIt all goes to your head and you become unbearable to live with because all you do is brag about all the points you have.you get to do a happy dance everytime you get to a new level.Well...I don't think an angel gets his wings, I know that much.
When you open your yahoo acct. at the top of the page under your name it says "MY ACCOUNT" click this; this will pull up your acct page where you can fill in only the info you want shared with others.  On the right hand side there will be under "Public Information" a choice to "Edit/Create Profile" that is the option you want. Now go in and have some fun.  You will be able to add a photo of you or something you like; put links in to some of your favorite webpages; whatever.  Its a simple fill in the blank type of form.Yahoo! offers the ability to make profiles through Yahoo! Member Directory or Yahoo! 360.  . . For Yahoo! Member Directory:. . -Go to 'http://members.yahoo.com and sign in. -Click on 'View My Profiles'. -Click on 'Create New Public' profile. -Complete profile form and click 'Create'. -If creating more than one, on the 'View My Profiles' page, make sure to set the default profile that others will see. . For Yahoo! 360, just go to http://360.yahoo.com. . To set your 360 as your default profile:. . - Go to http://360.yahoo.com/. - Click on "Settings" in the upper right of the page.. - Scroll down to the "Yahoo! Display Identity" section.. - Select either the second or third "Display me as" option.. - Save your new settings.. . Then everyone should go straight to your 360 page. Be sure to mark as private or friends only anything that you don't want everyone to see. . . When your 360 page is your profile, then your old profiles won't be accessible at all.. . If you do want to use your old profiles:. - Go to http://360.yahoo.com/. - Click on "Settings" at the top of the page. - Scroll down to the Yahoo! Identity Display section. - For each Yahoo! ID, choose the first "Display me as" option. - Save your changes. . Then they should revert back to your old profile so they can be edited. However, there's really no need to do this if you're going to make 360 your profile for those usernames again.Go into options. But if you have a yahoo account, you basically have one.Which profile do you mean? Do you want a 360 one? Here is the  link to get one of those below.. . http://360.yahoo.com/. . Here is the link to get a yahoo account below. http://www.yahoo.com/. . Just hit the sign up button, and then you can start to create one. I hope this helps!
Create another Yahoo ID and answer your limit on that one if you're that addicted to answering questions already.  Or just have fun asking (using up your points) and  rating best answers or voting for best answers.LOL ah ha i can. that happened to me the other day i was really pissed off so i made another email address. i found away to beat the ManS#%T HAPPENSHaving limits at the lower levels, and even the higher levels, helps to limit abuse. It also gives people a little time to learn the proper way to interact on the site. You can see that some people waste all of their answers with comments like "thanks for 2 pts" or "UR Stoopid" or "idk". If everyone could ask and answer more questions at the lower levels, then this junk would just overrun the system. . . That's why you earn more responsibility as you move up in points. The thought is that once you start contributing to the site on a consistent basis and have taken the time to move up in levels, then you are given more responsibility in the form of being able to ask and answer more questions. . . Once you get to level 5, then you've probably spent a lot of time on the site and know how to behave, so you have earned the right to answer an unlimited amount of questions.. . Also, there are probably some well-meaning people that just don't quite 'get it' during their early days on the site. They could unknowingly rack up enough violation notices for unintentionally bad behavior that their account would get suspended. The limit on points also reduces this likelihood.. . So, if you're done with your quota of answers for the day, then spend some time voting for some best answers on the questions that are unresolved, then spend some time rating best answers (thumbs up or down) on questions that are already resolved. If you answer AND vote AND rate as much as you're allowed everyday, then you'll make it to the next level more quickly and be able to answer more questions per day.Oh I remember that happening,we have all been there.:)level 1's can only answer 20 a dayjust wait til tomorrow.Why don't you have a DNA test done?. . Since many Dinosaurs had brains only the size of Walnuts, maybe, just maybe, they didn't go extinct after all.YUP , I've been there and done thatThat's the way the world works, buddy.
That's just how you think, but you're not completely broke. Straighten up, pick yourself up, do what you gotta do, and keep it real.No. I can not believe it. No one is born to be cent per cent a success or cent per cent a failure. Success and failure are all in our mind. These are actually two sides of the same coin. The fact that you put a question, and you have got an answer from me is the proof that you have succeeded in your effort to know. Likewise recollect many other past experiences in your life and treasure those to remind you that you have also stories of successes.Have faith in yourself and full faith in God who has been helping you doing things. Be conscious of this Truth and live a choice-less life, you will always be happy. God bless you!keep on at it, don't give up.  failure is nature's way of training you - don't give something up if you fail the first few times.
As everyone said, you'll definitely *see* the invitation when you go into 360 - it'll show as a "new message" at the top left.

See the link below to edit your alerts settings.You'll get a message telling you.I will see what I can docheck your blog for comments.  people can send invitations. .

sorry, the free Yahoo! account do not support mail forwarding or POP accessContact your isp (probably hawaiiantel)  and ask about their email forwarding options.You should contact your ISP (hawaiiantel) and find out how to set up forwarding. You can forward your email to yahoo but you will not be able to send from the new address. You will have to purchase mail plus for that. But if you have forwarding available on the other email address, you can send it to yahoo.hi try this out but im not sure.

U can do it with drag feaure. Just drag it to the size which u want  and after that make sure that u lock the toolbar to avoid such problem in the future.With a VERY large hammer.I assume you mean Yahoo! Toolbar since you put it in that category. Click the pencil icon beside the search box, a menu will drop down, click Toolbar Options, another menu will pop up, uncheck Enable Tabbed Browsing, click OK. This will make it about half the size.Under Internet Explorer, go to View, then Toolbars, and Uncheck each toolbar you dont want to see.Get firefox at http://www.getfirefox.com this will solve all your browser problems.  Its a free webbrowser that is 100 times better then what microsoft gives you.
Yeah, I find a few things kind of dingy on here. That means there's a human at the helm, someone who is not exactly perfect, and may have pet peeves of their own, probably!I asked the question "Goodfellas or Reservoir Dogs?" and it was removed, yet someone calling gays cu*ts has been left.They removed that question?  But they leave in all the sexual, perverted ones?  I don't understand it either!  Sorry you had your question removed.  :(I asked who was watchind BB in the UK, and that got removed. Someone asks about blow jobs and its kept on,. Whats that about????????that is kinda interesting...............
my yahoo email has been messing up all week i think its this new page they are doing i keep having to refresh mine about 10 times before it will work and sometimes i have to restart my computer. you can send error reports to yahoo there should be an option for it in you mail box. good luck!You did not state what the displayed error is, so I can only guess. However, browser-based applications -- such as Y! Mail -- rely on browsers to display and utilize their functions. Thus, look first to the browser for basic trouble-shooting. For example, try any or all of the ideas below, making sure to try your email again after each attempt.. . - Check your pop-up blocker (or blockers, if you have multiple) to see if any of them are preventing your composition box from displaying.. - Check your browser's security settings to see if somehow the Y! site was blocked or partially blocked.. - Restart the PC. - Delete your browser's cookies and clear its cache.. - Think about whether you installed any software just prior to when you experienced the functionality loss, including but not limited to... -- browser security updates. -- new chat software. -- new games. -- new business applications. -- downloaded shareware. . Once you have given this a good go-through, if you still have problems, the problem may reside on Yahoo!'s side.  At that point, check the discussion groups to see if anyone else is experiencing the same problem.  And, remember to post exactly what the error is, to give folks a decent chance at answering.. . :)
p / pay. e / every . p / penny . si/ to IsraelYour right what is the meaning of Pepsi, it tastes like dirt.The meaning of Pepsi is the sensation it invokes inside of you. For most people it is a cool, refreshing, tingling sensation. That's what Pepsi means to many - refreshment.Bradham coined the name Pepsi from the condition dyspepsia (stomachache or indigestion). It was made of carbonated water, sugar, vanilla, rare oils, and kola nuts. Whether the original recipe included the enzyme pepsin is disputed.If you asking about PEPSI-COLA:. Pepsi-Cola was first made in  North Carolina, Un.States in 1890 by the pharmacist Caleb Bradham. In 1898 , "Brad's drink" was renamed "Pepsi-Cola" . As Pepsi was made  to cure stomach pains, Bradham coined the name Pepsi from the condition dyspepsia (stomachache or indigestion)!!!!!!!!!!!!whats the meaning of marketing?God's gift to soda lovers everywhere!!!
Thou art a foul writer, sir William.  Thy grammar hath numerous mistakes.you aren't even speaking proper old english.. . your question is, "why am I get any answers to your questions". . smooth, Bill.For bon, thow speaketh ye olde english :)well to tell u the truth you sound stupid.. . Doth? i mean come on. 21st century.Sir William,"Did your peanut butter trip up your tongue on the roof of your mouth..doth..??"cuse U suckCuz no one can understand you-duhcuz u asked it......nerdWhat do you mean no answers!!! Look at all those!!! O.OMethinks ye be in the wrongth time periode.Because you suck at being William Shakespeare (I hope you cry).what questions? i see no info.whats ur ?AMLETO  . . This is  amleto ...  :-)). . to be ot  not tu beWhy art thou so lame?  Hast thou nothing better to do whilst surfing yon Internet?. . Heh hehIt is a little difficult to understand what you are tryna ask, if you make it clearer I am sure you will get answers.  Just make some adjustments somewhere.LOL i just want the 2 points lol do not care others do not answer his question lmao. Hummmmm what questions lol.Because your Elizabethan prose is terrible and you're using the words incorrectly.  Try this instead:. . "Why hast thou not answered any of my questions?  Knave, thou art a miserable, puking cutpurse unworthy of 10 extra points."Poor William......caught in a time you were never meant to be in.......To be.....or not....to be.........that is the question......!because they arent questions...ARE YOU EVEN SUPPOSED TO THY LIVING ON THY EARTH??You can increase the number of quality answers to your question by making your questions clear and concise. If your question is not understandable people will have a difficult time giving you quality answers. Also, add details to your question to give as much information as you can. This will tailor the answers to your specific query. Finally, placement is key. If you have a question about FIFA World Cup soccer it would not be wise to place it in the Pets category. Proper placement of a question insures prominence with people who are knowledgeable about that subject. Hope this helps!. KatieWhy headstrong liberty is lash'd with woe, so thou that hast no unkind mate to grieve thee, this fool-begg'd patience in thee will be left !what????????????Because you place them here.Most possibly because your attempts at promulgating esoteric cogitation or articulating superficial sentimentality fail miserably.Perhaps, sirrah, if thou wouldst put thy query in such fashion that a mere mortal could understand, thy questions would receive fair response.Because   your   question   is   confused .
Yahoo makes millions and millions of dollars and is richer than Bill Gates. Actually, he might own Yahoo, He got his start in computers.. Believe me, yahoo makes enough money from their paying advertisers to give everyone 100 times more free space and still be one of the most profitable businesses in the World.Very well.You're onto it. Yahoo's main source of revenue is in advertising dollars. Their pay per click program is a major source. ?a lot of people get together its their job to run this.
Yahoo! Answers is your basic search site except that you can get personal advice, experience, and expertise from users just like yourself.. . That was the original reason why this site was created. However, it's a great place to meet new people and ask alot of funny questions.Its an attempt to bring knowledge from all over the globe together in a community dedicated to the distribution and growth of knowledgeif u can't get wat ur looking for like in yahoo search, google...i do that...what would you use it for? We use it to share resources and information on the web.to get points for nothing doesnt really make sense...to interact with other people across the globe! isn't that a gr8 idea?I'm starting to believe that its some form of mind control that burrows its way more and more into our brains...... it starts with us staying up all hours just to rack up points and levels......the weak and defective are sifted out with abuse reports......and then those left end up following some large Hamster, all muttering "best answer....best answer....best answer...."
When you check the box that says something like "this is spam" Yahoo knows not to put it in your inbox anymore.  You could probably email Yahoo about the real bad ones.  Hey, you should let us all know what addresses these people pretending to be banks are coming from.Report them as SPAM
I dunno, that's a good question.  I think just judging them by their answers would give a false perception...because people pick and choose what they want to answer.  Their questions, however, are coming from their personal life.from both !!
The only way to listen to your voice mail message is through Yahoo! Messenger.  Therefore, if you want to get rid of it, you will have to download Messenger, listen to your message, then uninstall Yahoo! Messenger.how to get rid of a unread voice mail you click on it and it will have a chack in the box then find the delete button and click it if that doesn't work then i don't know
a far as i know, it's pretty straightforward and it's a standard yahoo policy/operating procedure - after 4 months of inactivity (i.e., no logging in), one's account is deactivated, and all the contents are deleted. . . now, most people have their 360 account merged with their yahoo email, so even if you completely abandoned your 360 page but keep using your yahoo email, your 360 page will stay intact.i believe its always activated. until someone deleted the yahoo accountWell, finally, Yahoo will stop blabbing to everyone where you live!
you ask to manyCertainly not for proper grammar.If You Ask Questions You Loose Points So Ask Questions You Really Don't KnowYou cannot lose points for some of your questions............You lose em for all your questions!!! Asking a question costs 5 points, but u get 3 points back when u choose a best answer.It costs 5 points to ask a question.if u ask a question, you lose 5 points. u can get it back when u answer a question or vote for a best answer.
How would we get our suggestions through?. Discuss it on the Yahoo! Answers forum (there's a link in the upper right corner here).. . This particular idea has been suggested already along with tons of others. Users add extra ideas and discuss how it could be made possible. The Yahoo! Answers team reads everything on the forum, even if they don't always post a response. They've said they're coming out with some new innovations soon, but I have no idea if this is one of the things they plan on implementing.. . Personally, I'm not sure how exactly this would work since there are so many questions and it seems some of them never even get read, but if you have ideas on how to make them work don't be afraid to speak up. A lot of the updates they make on this site do come from user suggestions.Well, u cant really vote for a Good Question...among what, the millions of others posted everyday? Bearing in mind that we all dont get to see all the questions or the same one for that matter.. . But i think what u are trying to say is that people should be able to Rate questions..and those questions would probably get Points depending on the Percentage of Votes gotten within a Period of time.because we can't find them in the first place!. . But you can use the forum for suggestions!Yahoo Answers is improving all the time.  Give them time.I already give 10 pts to those who ask good questionsit will take years before they will reply to you
Follow this path. Go to ur email page> options> Block address > list of blocked addresses> find the address which u want to unblock> select that> remove> save. It will solve ur problem.Go to the OPTIONS setting & click , find BLOCKED ADDRESSES & click , hilight & delite the name you want !!!When you look at the mail message, you can see the options. There is one choice wich is "Not Spam". Click that, and I think that it'll know that is isn't spam anymore.They have more than likely been added to your Blocked Addresses List.  To unblock them and to stop receiving all unwanted email, do the following:. . Log into your Email, go to Options (upper right hand side). Go through all your settings and don't forget to save them too. . . Under Spam Protection, make sure your Spam Guard is turned ON. Option to immediately delete all Spam messages. This will force all new email to redirect to your Inbox. Option to Block messages that you mark as Spam. If you plan on keeping your . Bulk folder, also option messages you mark as Not-Spam to be moved to your Inbox. Always Option to Block all Images until you can look them over first. This prevents spammers from knowing you opened their email. Save Changes. . . Under Blocked Addresses, type in spammer.com, this will stop all Spam that has been reported to Yahoo from ever entering your email. I recommend you remove everything on your list first. This will give you a fresh start after you type in the "spammer.com". . . Under General Preferences, Folders/Search Results, Special Folders, option to redirect incoming unsolicited email to the Bulk Folder. Save. . . If you get email from someone you don't know, NEVER open it (it may contain viruses) and report it as SPAM. This will automatically block it from your email account. When you do open an email that is Spam, you have alerted the sender that your account is Active. . . This should slow down the Junk Mail considerably. I only get maybe one or two Spam emails a Month. . . Good Luck!

See the three links below for your info. I found this information by doing a simple search of the Y! Answers database. You did not need to waste your points.This works if you have Internet Explorer as your browser.. The record of search history which appears in the search box on Yahoo and Google pages is actually a feature controlled by your browser.. . Click Tools at the top of your screen, a menu will drop down, click on Internet Options, then click on the Content tab. . Under Personal information, click on the AutoComplete box. . On the AutoComplete Settings window click the Clear Forms box to delete your current history, or you can uncheck the Forms box to permanently stop the generation of the search history. When you are finished remember to click OK.. . If you just want to clear searches on Yahoo or Google Home Page or any other Yahoo or Google page, double click the search box, this will make a menu drop down with your searches, put your cursor on what you want to delete to highlight it, hit the delete button on your keyboard. If you want to delete everything just hold the delete button down until everything is deleted.. . To clear pages you have visited on Internet Explorer address bar, click Tools, Internet Options, under General tab click Clear History, you can also set the number of days to keep pages in history, click Apply and then click OK. You may also want to click the Content tab and click Auto Complete and check or uncheck your Auto Complete settings to your preference.. . To clear searches on Yahoo Toolbar, click the pencil icon beside the search box, a menu will drop down, click Clear Recent Searches.

Unfortunately, there's no way to contact them. They have to respond to a confirmation email they were sent before they can accept any messages. However, I'm not sure why they're allowed to send messages and list their contact option when you really can't.  :(Well, if you are replying to the message directly, as in clicking the "reply" button while you are on the message screen, then the address should come up exactly the way the person sent it. But if you are reading the message, then attempt to reply by starting an entirely new one, make sure you copy the address exactly the its supposed to be copied.. . Remember: Every E-Mail address must have some sort of ID, (the first part of the address), the "@" symbol, then an ISP (Internet Service Provider), then either ".net" or ".com". Here's an example-  Somebody123@Yahoo.com - . . If you have tried all of this and you still cannot reply to the message, you can probably find a "help" button which should have an F.A.Q. page which might be able to help you out.you have to click on there name and then go to there contact spot and click on it and it should work try it and tell me if it dose work okay good luck

I suggest a fresh install of Yahoo! Messenger.  First, a fresh install will ensure you have the latest build of Yahoo! Messenger.  Also, a reinstall will write over any Messenger files that may have become corrupt and causing this My Yahoo! contact issue.  There are two versions of Yahoo! Messenger available.  Yahoo! just launched Yahoo! Messenger version 8.0, which includes plug-ins, integration of Yahoo! 360, Soundtrack, and Soundboard.  For version 8, just go to http://messenger.yahoo.com, click on the ‘Get it Now’ button, and follow the installation process.  If you are not ready for the beta, just click on the ‘Get version 7.5’ link located directly under the ‘Get it Now’ button to get the current version, version 7.5.maybe it thinks you are your own friend.  :-)

You know, for over three weeks I put a good amount of time on YA every day answering questions, rating questions, etc..., trying to fulfill my 'points addiction'...  I then came to the sudden realization that it is precisely this ridiculous competition for 'points' that have made this site as deplorable as it is.. . You have discovered early on what it took me almost a month to find:  Your own incentive for participating on YA will  provide more noble rewards for you than any pointless 'points'  could possibly do.. . You will reach level three, then level four, and so on and so on.... And, given your view of 'points' thus far,... you probably won't even know it when you do...;-)My incentive was to be able to answer more questions! :-). The points are well, as you say, ultimately pointless, but they do help you to earn more responsibility on the site.. . 600 points isn't too far away ... at Level 2 you can,. . -Vote for 40 best answers per day. -Rate 40 best answers per day. -Answer 40 questions per day. . That's 160 points per day that you can control.  If you answer/rate/vote your limit each day, then you can be at Level 3 in less than 4 days!bragging rights and knowing you are helping some people :)Its not really,but if you give good answers you can be getting points from people rating them while your not even on,  You hit a point where it starts to snowball up.Doesn't mean very much except the higher level you are, the more you can post in a day.  That isn't always a good thing.  I spend too much time on this.is really not important it just feels goodnot reallY, But I am competitiveI don't know, but I must do it.Yea she is pretty I saw her first.your pretty.I believe most of the contributors are correct.  To be able to ask requires you to answer.  It creates a responsive, cooperative community.  There are concerns.  One of which is, with some answers the point IS the point. And because of this, the asker can't get a decent answer when they need one.  I agree with you, some of the comments are a blast.  Some are inventive, creative.  And some . . . . hit the nail on the head so hard it hurts.    I have been guilty of not answering the question, but in most cases, it has been to express my amazement with the response.  I have since learned that I can use comments for that purpose, which by the way can earn points. Then you also receive points for best answer.  You can add those to the list an earlier person posted.  So receiving 600 points could take even less time to accumulate.  Not all people think the same, which is good.  Keep on typin' and enjoy!Nothing else better to do.don't know but it is fun to gain them....thanks for the 2Because if this point system was not there then no body would have answered any question, they all would have just asked them. You have to help others if you want them to help you.its not important to me.  i just like being able to post some smart@ss questions and answer some questions when im reallt bored.  im only on this for maybe an hour a day and not every day.

Yahoo! Answers upgraded their servers recently. They'll remember all your answers so you can just search for them instead of trying to remember them yourself.Who's memory are you worried about?  It's all saved on Yahoo's servers, not your computer.But they will always be in your heart.hey  hon  take  pint  and   relax its  nothing  on  Ur  comp   ,,,,well  i  hope  so ,,  but  don't  trust  me  cause  I'm  blondi think yahoo saves them to their database. they are not saved to your computer. don't worry about it.

I think its there to make sure and remind you that you still may not choose a best answer because as more and more people view your question, they may have an answer to it which may be the overall best and informative answer. Within that 24 hours you can expect to get a lot of answers, which may even have useful information which can help to resolve your question or put it to vote if you're not sure.They want you to have the oppurtunity to get some honest opinions. and a variety.Cause they think this forum merits standards.  Just kidding, moderators..  :-Phi music-standard operating pocedure-this way you have to come back on-commercial product-this is not a not for profit organization-lots of love keep the peace old hippieIf people come and just see the answers, they might not figure out they're supposed to select a best one. At least with the button there, they'll know that they're supposed to, even though it's annoying to find out you have to wait 24 hours.
I figure it is one of 2 things,, they are messing with it at Yahoo.. or the government is accessing all of us Yahoo users....... .  Big Brother,,,,, who knows?????????because yahoo is not google, yah.................oo..................!!!I'm having the same problem as well. I was wondering about it. Anyone care to enlighten us?subliminal? or are you asleep?I wrote to yahoo customer care, but they didn't explain, they just said to refresh the page and that would fix it...That is a real good question it is starting to getting to be a big problem this weekYOU ARE NOT ALONE!!!! I've wanted to freakin punch a hole in the wall! Two nights ago I was logged out for no reason at all and it wouldn't log back in for anything. Yesterday morning I downloaded the very latest version of yahoo messenger and ALAS! I got logged in! But I keep getting logged out every so often for no reason and then it'll log right back in. I wrote yahoo customer service about it. I was supposed to recieve a response within 24 hours and I have yet to get it. But you know what really burns me? Is that if they're having problems with their servers or with bugs with the version of messenger...they should POST AN ANNOUNCEMENT somewhere on their site to let everyone know! They completely leave us in the dark about everything. At least on myspace when they're having a problem with something, they post a message so everyone knows. That's called good customer service. I think yahoo needs to take a few steps up in the customer service department.
because i already have ALL the answers!!!!  ha ha haBecause, presumably, they're thinking first, then asking questions, even if the thinking is minimal and not well-formed.I guess some people have more knowledge... or need someone who listens to them.. . I wonder what happens to your level if your points drop.i'm saving for retirementI rarely think of more than one question in any 24 hour time period.  Although saying that, in two months I've only thought of 5 questions to ask.I want to know what it feels like to get to level 3.You ask tooo much...............

click the box!Click it again and this will uncheck the boxes.  When you sign out it should not automatically sign you back in.Open your messenger and don't click any item.

(Which will uncheck it).CLick the liitle box that says remeber user password on this computer. Duh, JK! he hecheck it agent it will unlock it

coz songs are all about life - songs are all about experience and feelings , they are all about how we see life..... yeah you are right, i also used a song for mine too, but guess the song???LOLI best express myself through song.oh wow i never i don't think but i will change it soon . cool HIGH WAY TO HELL. no i'm joking, it's a long way to the top,Yes! I'm listening to music right now!Some lyrics are easy to remember because they are repeated on the radio many times.. If they are not quoting song lyrics they might be quoting their parents or a teacher.. All language is learned.. People are not born knowing how to talk.. . "If you wannabe my lover, You gotta get with my friends," Does she want me to have sex with her friends so they can tell her how it was.. . ur so vain u probably think this song is about u. I'll bet u think this song is about u. Don't you? Don't you?maybe they feel that song explains themselves in some way shape or form, I think it is cool. Being an artist myself it is a way of expressing themselves, or connecting to it in some way.. . If you have song lyrics in your OWN profile, why did YOU put it there? You can just easily answer your own question right then and there. Peace!because it explains who they rbecause it show people what they like to listen to. "someone please save us, us college kids. waht my parennts told me is what i did.  they said go to school and be a college kid.  but in the end i questioned why i did."  . i love that song!!!
Get a Logitech cam at almost any computer store. It will have the software you put in the puter then you can be a cam ho!To make it so that other people can view your webcam, you need to buy one, install and hook it up, then turn on the camera using yahoo messenger. To view someone else's camera, click "View My Webcam" on their status icon, or have them invite you to view it.
To change your font size, go to VIEW on your browser and click on TEXT SIZE. Medium Text is normal so try that first and see  if you like that.If you are talking about the font size on the screen, you can adjust that by holding down the "Ctrl" key and dialing the wheel on your mouse. This is a trick I just learned, and I have been a programmer for years!
When I first found with this site, I needed to know where a particular school was located (this was not the site I originally was trying to get to) and once I began to answer the questions that I could, it became a fun thing for me...the point system wasn't an issue...even as they started adding up I always tried to answer to the best of my abililty....sadly, there are always going to be those who find it amusing and funny to respond like you mentioned.... I don't care if they get the two points.... it WON'T improve their lives as apparently they don't have much of one or they wouldn't try to get something for nothing....more points = delusions that you actually know stuff = more self esteem = 'improvement of your life somehow'perro is spanish for dog , not tree monkeySome people need to get a life. As for me I like to give a funny answer (humor is great) to some questions but never thought about any points. Making people laugh is helpful don't you think? . . Although I think if you get enough points you can print it out, take it to jack in the box, show them and with only a dollar you can get anything you want that happens to be on their dollar menu.I like answering questions, beats the boredom.  So when I reach that daily limit for the day it kinda sucks because I have to find a new hobby.  Atleast getting me to the next level keeps me entertained awhile.a lot of people are just bored, have nothing better to do, they use this as entertainment for themselves.Welcome to the world!  Everybody seems to be this way.  All I can say is when they all get old, do not expect a compassionate person anywhere around them because you only get back what you put forward in the world and its not looking good these days, I'm telling  you.Kinda gives you a game to play that involves your fellow mankind that you may never meet in person,but your sharing,and competing online.because its almost like an addiction...the same as a drug addiction...I swore I was going to bed a little bit ago but noticed I needed less than 100 points to make my next level so here I am! LOL! I swear the "you just answered a question...2 points" is a rush! . But honestly...I also like to answer the questions...the real ones that is....with the hope I may actually help someone out. I guess call it Karma....I am not, I get a kick  outta doing this.... Don't you? thanks fer the points anyway !Have you not heard about the prizes you win when you get 5000 points, that's why and since you are waiting for it and I can't really help you in any other way ,just because you're waiting for it . THANKS FOR THE TWO POINTS yeeeeeeeeeeha
Make a new acc. Your only option...... I think.There are privacy laws relating to 13 and under which limit children from accessing certain sites, providing personal information, etc.  Because of this, you will likely not be able to change your birthdate.  Your best bet is to create a new account.You should just be able to click on "My page" and edit the information....that's what it usuallyu takes.go to my account and click edit settings
you put it on a hoist in gear (engine OFF!), then turn the rear wheel. count the rotations of the drive shaft for one full turn of the wheel. that number, for example, 9 turns of the drive shaft for one turn of the wheel, gives you the ratio of the gears in the rear end, 9:1.Like they said earlier - buy the $15 manual - and the ID plate is located on the rear end. You can also run the numbers on the engine.I think you you should go to an auto body shop and ask someone about it!There should be a ID plate welding to the casing, giving you the model and ratio of the assemblyyou didnt ask for a gear ratio did you? and why go to a body shop?  You can get a haynes manual for your truck at the parts store for about $12 or look on ebay. It will list what options your truck will have  and how to identify you rear end. Ford 9"?Look at the tag attached to the rear end.
It means you've reached your limit for the day.  However, you can look over answers that need voting on if you want to pass the time and gain points.  You could always ask a question or 2 as well.  That limit happened to me once when I was on level one, keep earning points and you'll move up sooner than you think.. Good Luck!go to bed and start again tomorrowEither go to bed (or do whatever, depending on where you are it might be mid day for all I know) or you can start rating answers - I think it's 1 point for each answer you rate.You have reached your answering limit...Come back tomorrow!!!!!!!!!Get to a higher level so you can answer more questions in a day, the way to get to a higher level is to answers wisely so it gets picked as the best, VOTE on as many questions as you can (you get 1 point per vote) and RATE as many answers as you can (1 point per rate) and pretty soon youll be at a higher level where you can answer more questions in a day!It means that you have answered your limit for the day. wait until tomorrow and all will be well. does that make sense?wait until tomorrow. the more points you get the more questions you can answer.harakiri or you can wait a day for another batch. All that stops when you reach a certain leve.You can use this opportunity to go through the BEST ANSWERS of others, Browse to see what other questions are there. You can rate others anwers. Already solved ones can also be rated.. Also you can note down points for other questions which you would like to answer next day.That way your answer can be abridged and presented nicely to get 10 points easily.Wait 24 hours and start over.If you have reached your limit to answer questions, you can vote for thumb sup or down on best answers and you can vote for best answers for questions that have been abandoned by their owners, and yahoo has to pick the best answer from the list of answers given.. You get 1 point for each vote and it really adds up quickly. Wait I could be wrong about the amount you get for voting it could be more than 1 point, but I know it is at least 1 point. . Or you could set up a 360 page or edit your profile, or in the event of being really late at night, you could decide to get some more sleep and attack again in the light of day. Fresh and ready to type, type , type!. Or why don't you check your mail, you may have an invitation to join a new group or something like that. You just never know.you stop & wait until the next day when you'll be able to answer more. As you gain more points & levels, you'll be able to answer more, too.You go to bed and wait for a new day to begin, so that Answers refreshes and you can answer more questions.

Sorry, that sucks but  its the Yahoo Gods who are torturing you. It will be ok shortly for us who need our messenger fix, if you've already got the shakes here's a secret, change your 'connection preferences' to 'firewall without proxie' and magically you get onto yahoo messenger, though youll be booted often at first. Messenger should be up and running like normal in about an hour... yeah right.There was an intermittent login issue last night, June 22nd, that affected many of the Yahoo! Messenger users (and some Yahoo! Mail users). While it wasn’t an issue to login to Yahoo! Answers, as you can see that those affected by the login issue were able to come on here and ask questions, some Yahoo! sites/products were affected. However, because I have premium (paid) Yahoo! services (i..e. Yahoo! Voice) I was able to chat online with the Yahoo! support team and just learned the problem is now solved and the total downtime was only 2 hours. We can now all login to Yahoo! websites and Yahoo! Messenger.

They probably have a block on it. I do.they dont recieve it or they are ignoring you?
Unfortunately, you cannot delete a Yahoo! 360 account. It's linked to your primary Yahoo! ID.  If you want to keep your Yahoo! ID for things like Mail, IM, Answers, etc. then you'll need to hide your 360.. . There are a few different ways to do this,. . 1) Select the "Settings" option at the upper right of your 360 page and change all of you settings to 'Private'.  This hides the majority of your content, if someone stumbles onto your page.. . 2) Perform option #1 and then select the first "Display Me As" option on the Settings page. Now your profile doesn't link to your 360 page. Also, UNcheck the "Activate Simple URL" setting and the "Friend Search" setting.  This way people cannot guess your 360 page by sticking your yahoo id onto the end of 360.yahoo.com or searching for you by name or email address.. . 3) Perform options #1 and #2 and then delete your friends by selecting the "My Friends" link in the upper right of your 360 page. Select "Edit Settings" on a friend's name, then select "Remove <friend> from your Friends Page".   Finally, delete all of your content, blogs, links to pictures, lists, reviews, etc.  This pretty much makes your 360 inaccessible and/or unusable by anyone who happens to get there.It is not a valid option at the mean time to delete your 360 blog once you signed up to this service.. Try to remove all the information and details instead.If, however, you want to keep your Yahoo! 360 account but not have it go to 360 when you go to http://profiles.yahoo.com/____ (where the blank is your Yahoo! ID) then you should check out this other answer:. . http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=1006012511402
go to your "tools" bar and click on "internet options" and click clear history, you can also delete cookies to pretty much start from scratch on all of your internet websitesAs they are highlighted hit delete.look at the little pencil next to the  search box.    Click  it then click clear search  history.Click on the icon that look like a pencil. A drop down list will appear. Choose "Clear search history". I think it is the third or fourth option.If you have IE 8.0, y ou can click in the search box then hit Clear in the upper right.
Send them a invitethere is alink under the list of your friends on the page and you can invite them using that link. it says invite friends.
As long as you know their ID, it's easy. In Messenger 7.5 click in the contact search text field where it says "type a Yahoo! ID or phone number", type the person's ID and press Enter. Then just IM them like you would anyone else.You really can't unless they have given access to their email address, then you would have to add that to your yahoo messenger.
ok...start from the first name that you want to delete and click on it...it should highlight the name...then hold down the control key and click on the rest of the names that you want to delete.  Holding down the control key will enable you to highlight multiple names.  Once you are done, right click with the mouse and choose delete.  This should delete all the highlighted names.What?

I don't think all people are meant to be outgoing, that's just not who they are.. . Their self esteem would be better if they realized who they are now is OK.This is a really hard question that many people would love to know the answer to, so you are not alone. I think it is different depending on your personality. You can start in the things you like to do and feel comfortable doing and work on being happy with yourself in those things. Then set new challenges for your self maybe to learn something new or try a new sport. Confidence sometimes comes from doing very well at things and being happy with the person you are. I also had trouble with this when I was younger. So, I started playing sports and challenging myself to talk to people, to go places that I would usually say no because I was too shy. Being outgoing is just branching out and showing your beautiful self to the world.let me tell you some real GOOD advice. if someone doesn't like you for who you are then they are not worth having as a friend or potential mate. you shouldn't have to change for anyone! if you want to better yourself thats perfectly fine but you don't want to try and impress some guy when in reality he is really not worth it. its ok to be shy and some people find that very attractive. there is nothing wrong with wanting to be more outgoing but do it in little steps. for example go to a mall and go up to guys and just ask what time it is. do it to several people everyday or ask for directions even if you know how to get there. by doing this you will actually become more comfortable talking to people. it might sound silly but it will work in time. ask open ended questions as well. instead of asking do you like candy? answer would be yes. ask so whats your favorite type of candy? " i like kit kats" then you could be like me 2 i really like the blah blah, well i hope this helps some what. another tip of advice would be to start to respect yourself and like yourself more. if you don't the way you look or whatever then you shouldnt be in a relationship just yet. when you start to respect yourself and care for yourself then you will have room for someone else. remember that everyone will not like you because people in general are judgemental.try to forget that and brush it off. if you don't think highly of yourself then who will? certainly not your next potential mate. take care and good luck!Start believing in your self; by starting with little things. for example: think to your self i'm worth while, or i can do this.. . Try new things, like fishing, or standing up for what you believe in, no matter if your alone.. . Talk to your friends if you need help with something, even if you think is stupid. If they are your true friends they will help, not laugh.. . Hope this helps..It just takes practice.  Start by getting around a few friends you feel comfortable with and be outgoing with them.  They will help to be your support group.. . The best thing you can do is to build your self-esteem.  You need to believe that you're a good person and that nobody else's opinion matters.  Create your own identity that you're proud of.. . Read books these books: . * Psycho Cybernetics. * How to win friends and influence people. . Psycho Cybernetics is not to be confused with Dianetics or Scientology.  It's a great book that teaches you how to change yourself, the way you think, and to overcome challenges.  It helped me a great deal!

Anyone on the WWW can view your 360? if your settings are public. If you chat with this friend on Yahoo Messenger or Instant Messenger and if your 360? has been activated to replace your old profile...he just clicks on your name and when he goes to view profile..he gets your 360?!there should be a button down below on your homepage that says something about searchin for some one by first or last nameLike this: Example: http://360.yahoo.com/farside76 where my yahoo ID is, put their yahoo ID in if you know it and if they have a yahoo360 page, otherwise it won't show, their page has to be public, and the yahoo360 link must be activated.he can not view you 360 page without activating his 360 page then he can click on the SEARCH option in the upper right hand corner of the 360 page then type in your name or yahoo id and he will be able to find you.
pull up ur messenger and right click ( i know u already did that) but all the way at the bottom of it is the delete option. Or highlight persons name and go to contacts (on messenger) and click delete that way.Find the person's name/ID in your messenger list, right click, then hit delete (at the bottom of the list).   If you don't see delete, you can left click on the person's name/ID in your list, click on Contacts at the very top, then click on delete.  A gray box will appear asking if you're sure.  You probably want to check the "delete from address book, too" box.  Then hit yes.  Then go to your Ignore list and add his ID there.
mine does the same,sometimes I have to use another chat client to log in & invite myself to view to stop it from crashing.All my programs are updated so I'm not exactly sure why it does it.But when I try this solution it fixes it for meeither your internet connection is too slow or you don't have enough RAM memory or your computer processor speed is slow...take your pick.also make sure you have the latest drivers and updates for your camera by going to the website of whoever makes the camerasame reason the mirror breaks all the time. no im joking. i dont knwo anythign about computersbecause you are too cute
Do you mean what name is displayed in the emails that you send? Certainly you can change that.. Go to mail Options (on upper right ) and General preferences. There you can change your "From Name" to anything.you can't do that!. :)

If it is a new group, it can take several days for the group directory to be updated.  Also, adult groups do not come up in the search.Have you changed the settings to state that you wanted the Group to be found in the listings?  Also, if it is a new Group, it may take Yahoo a few days to get the group indexed into the listings.
theyre afraid of sharp, pointy objects. obviously they dont know how to have fun. now if youll excuse me, im off to run with scissors.If too many people are offended by it and report it, it's bound to get deleted whether it's bad or not. I'd suggest reposting it and hoping for the best.Yep, I've had that happen to me. It was a serious question about Juvenile Court and they deleted it. I believe other questions should have been deleted before mine. Sorry it happened to you.Yahoo is weird...wait...maybe it was context.... . and what about the suicide quesiton...how did that not get deleted.... . and the murder questions..It appears that yahoo does random question screenings and  possibly your ? did not  meet that specific individual's  constraints
I would do it only if I really liked the question, I didnt want to go search it for people's answers, and I didnt know how to use the watch question link.. . Nevermind, I wouldnt do it.Did you ever notice how come when someone asks a question on here and they see below that the question has been asked a gagillion (sp) times, why do they still ask it?with hopes for different answers to the same questions.. i dont think they realize that you get different answers if they ask different questions.. lol. well hey.. . thats life.... we ask the wrong questions in hopes for all the right answers...That is anyone's guess.gagillion?they might not have liked the answers all ready posted, they might just re-asking a question, or they didn't see the previous answers.I don't think they think...all they have to do is scroll down and they'll see the same questions over and over and over...it's annoying..but I answer them for my 2 points..and hopefully 10.I agree. I can't figure it out.. . If I see "How many licks does it take to get to the center of a tootsie pop" any more I am going to scream!I know. I have answered the same ones over and over. It gets me points, but it gets boring.They want the answers for themselvesThey're lazy, stupid, imature, and self centred. They obviously don't read, and they have a childish constant need for attention.....at any cost!!!!Because its their question, and their right to obtain more than one answer, and no where does it say that the question can be asked only once....or this would be a boring place to come to:-)for the fun of it!Idiom....Why ask this one?what kind of question is thismaybe they think they'll get different answers?
i am having the same problem. i think it has something to do with the new system. i have to keep backtracking. it's extremely annoying; don't they know i need those points!It could be a glitch or the person asked it twice.It is random but has a short posting time limit! . . . . . . --- LeeeN @ http://groups.yahoo.com/group/ilovejokesI don't know but The yahoo team is already working on this!
You switch back to the old version then reinstall the new version.sorry wish i could help. I am a plus user of the mail system as well and i dont even know how to do that.. . Remember, only the people that pay for yahoo get the new mail beta.

It might have something to do with the "toast" window that comes up in the bottom right corner of the screen. You can turn this off in Preferences, Alerts & Sounds. in the Messenger menu.I suggest a fresh install of Yahoo! Messenger.  First, a fresh install will ensure you have the latest build of Yahoo! Messenger.  Also, a reinstall will write over any Messenger files that may have become corrupt and causing this screen flash issue.  Just go to http://messenger.yahoo.com, click on the 'Get it Now' button, and follow the installation process.. . You can turn off the feature in preferences as a workaround to prevent the flashing.  However, if you prefer these alerts, try the reinstall.to tell you you got an email or im
You can change your email address by editing your address and adding another. You can't hide it, however. It's not a feature.As stated in the above response, only the Owners and Moderators can view the entire email addresses. . . And there is a Management Tool that allows addresses to be hidden, but the Group Owner/and selected managers are the only ones who can make that change. . . However, most do not use this feature because Members who do decide to hide their address will not be able to use the Polls features and are not able to post messages via email. And, once the Owner has selected this option, they may not change it later.The full address shows when it is your own email address.  The other members only see the truncated address for your address, but they see their own address spelled out in full.Watch "hallowman" the investiable man.
I don't know mine is acting funny too. It will let me log on and then it will kick me off. What is up with that?I am having problems logging into my email account.  It will not give me access even though I have entered my user name and password.  Please let me know the reason.I upgraded to the latest Messenger version last night (8.0 I think), and now I can't sign in at all and when I go to Yahoo Messenger Help, all it wants to do is remind me of my password or assign me a new one ... well heck .. I know my password so I don't need that .... then it says that my ID is signed on another machine somewhere, so either I have been hacked or yahoo is screwed up, because I only have one machine with Yahoo on it ..... . What gives???There was an issue this intermittent login issue this morning that affected many of the Yahoo! Mail and Yahoo! Messenger users.  While it wasn’t an issue to login to Yahoo! Answers, as you can see that those affected by the login issue were able to come on here and ask questions, many Yahoo! sites/products were affected.  However, because I have premium (paid) Yahoo! services (i.e. Yahoo! Voice, Yahoo! Mail Plus), I was able to chat online (and call) the Yahoo! support team and just learned the problem is now solved.  We can now all login to Yahoo! websites and Yahoo! Messenger.hi there.  here's an easy way to figure out the problem:. . 1) login via the web messenger: http://messenger.yahoo.com/webmsgr/fmsgr.php. . 2) if that works, your account is fine, and it's a temporary solution when you can't log in.  . . 3) if you don't use voice, and don't plan to, you can go back to the old one here: http://www.download.com/Yahoo-Messenger/3000-2150_4-10429465.html. . 4) if you can't login via the web messenger, then something's wrong with your account and you should contact customer care.. . good luck!. . hope this helps.  if so, please resolve your question and vote for a best answer...that way it helps us answerers from duplicating efforts.  thank you!even i am not able to login to messenger. i thinkl there r some problems from yahoo side/.
I have no ideal - kind of new myself- gee i guess i should not of answerd this -sorryYou have to click (open) the album you want to move.. Click on name and description, it's in grey.

(next to name and description) click on cover & background, you can choose any picture from your album to show as the cover.. Good Luck!

I donno but I hate it when a person won't pick a best answer. I always try to pick one. Yahoo sends you an email that says you need to pick one. Are people really just too lazy to do that?Wow,what a dilemna... that is really profound ...I am glad it worked out for you and you got the validation ...I think maybe you should call your publicist and start writing a novel about it ...I think it will just be a riveting work!!!*claps* Good job! you got 10 points awww... *pets* You got 1 yay!!! People post and they do not answer your questions ( or pick you for the "chosen answer")... thats why. Obviously you need to find a new hobby if this is what you're worried about!In that case, it is Yahoo asking for a vote.  If the votes for a particular question are tied, and keep coming out a tie, then they send it to votes over and over.  Sometimes takes quite awhile.they just forget about the question, then it automatically goes to voting.They tend to forget or they want to see how many responses they getdont be mean. have some fun.Well people let it sit there for months so they get a lot of answers or a varity of different answers. And after a while when most of the people stoped answering they go back and find a best answer, cuz if they do it right away then it is waisted, and what if they found a better answer than the 1 they picked. I hoped that helped. :)
Check out the links below.  The provide you with the instruction on how to delete your account.just don't use it for several months it will be automatically deletedhttps://edit.yahoo.com/config/delete_userJust sign outi have no idea but u have to ask yahooi would like my acct to be deleted pleaseTheres  a delete button.you can't delete if you want to delete dont use till 1 month it is automaticly closed...Have your Yahoo account inactive for 1 month + and it will delete inselfif u don't use it for like more than 6 than it will automatically delete itself.Don't go to it...just let it sit there for a month or so...it will deleteStop going it and it will delate within 6 months or so. If it doesnt dont worry it will if you no longer log into it.u can instantly delte it from ur mailbox options
When you registered for a Yahoo! ID, you were asked for your date of birth (DOB).  Therefore, if you change your profile age to show 18 or above, that will not change your registration information.  Your profile is just the information you want to show to others that view it.It goes by your birthday from when you signed up, not by your profile age.  You can't change your birthday because well, it normally doesn't change...it uses your date of birth
if there is a lag between the time you deactivated your yahoo account and the deactivation of your 360 page, you can click on the "report abuse" link on your old page and request that it be taken down.  provide your current contact info so that yahoo customer care can verify your identity if necessary.You should review the 360 user agreement. Not only can they keep the page up for as long as they want, it can be printed and published in books. Not only that, third parties are logging its contents into permanant archives.. Its best to not generate web content that you'll be embarassed about later in the first place.
   I've had the Indigo skin for years. You had to download and unzip it to get it, there's no other way. Unfortunately the unzip instructions given by Yahoo are now incorrect.

To answer your question. You need to go to the options tab, then the signature section. Then use the tab that switches the signature format over to html. you will know because you will seee << >>br  all over the place. Now you have to take your logo and host the image somewhere. What this means is go to a website like photobucket.com or vidilife.com. sign up, its free and they don't spam. upload your logo and then choose, "get code" this will give you the needed code to display the image at the bottom of all of your emails in your signature. copy and paste this code into the signature section of Yahoo and then play with the size a little by sending it to yourself and then checking out what it looks like.You must enable HTML format, and create stationary. If the recipient is reading it in plain text, it will be a jumbled mess and the image will not show.

Maybe they just come looking at your profile after you give your stupid smart @$$ answers, then give it right back to you like I am!. . Also that avatar looks like you are about to cry like a little girl!maybe because you met people looking in physical appereance And it does'nt matter if your a german past is past be proud of what you are that all it takes.They are only mean when they wake up on the wrong side of the bed.Same answer as you gave me.   I know how you feel...That is their problem..prejudice, plus some people are just fanatics.... don't let them get you...They probably just have bad gas and it makes them cranky and they let it out on you.Because people have different personalities. If everyone was the same I wouldn't like that..People are a challenge. You never know what someone is thinking and you never know how someone feels..unless they speak..Now you may not always like what they are saying but that's just life.it makes some pepole feel good to hurt others its a power trip for them. everyone has there   own way of doing things just ignore the pepole who hurt youYou gotta admit its bummer being named after the most prolific figure of evil in human history. . . But if thats your real name then thats the fault of the person complaining for being close minded. My first anme is Joel. Im sure there was some butthole in history named Joel.they wanna stand up n be counted? don't see anything wrong with ya name, your make-believe looks or your nationality.Cuz they spend their time being mean to everyone instead of being nice!!LOL?????!!!!!some pepole are racist and hate adolf for hitler or they are just b***hscuz they dont like youThe anonymity of the net is very provocative -- people can say what they want and not have any negative repercussions.  Ignore them or blast em back and have fun with it.  Who cares what you really look like or what your name really is?  Be whoever you want to be.dont mind them ok be proud.....they r stupid.....maybe in a way im sure u r kinda in a way ashamed by named adolf....well  forget them  be happy that ur german!!! they dont know if u r an nice person  its their lost!! them stupid people...Wizard's First Rule: people are stupid.They are jealous - everyone is jealous of the Germans! Touch mien monkey!Mean people are not happy within themselves! Remember that for life and ignore them. Misery loves companyit makes people feel better to put other people down. People are just ass holes. Ignore it. You are probably better than them anyways.Wow! I'm German too and many people call me names! I live in the U.S. though. My dad is from Germany. I wouldn't worry about what people think of your name. You know who you are so it does not matter! I'm proud to be German!Don't listen to those people.  They just think it's fun to be mean to people cause they don't have anything better to do.  They're just being stupid.. . Being German ROCKS!!  I've been to Germany, a couple of times, and it's awesome!  Do you know how to speak it?  If you do:   Wie geht es dir heute?Because they are just not satisfied with their life and are unhappy on the inside so when they are mean to someone it makes them feel as if they are better than that other person.i dont know...i actually like the name Adolf...its cute...and i LOVE foriegn boys. hee heeDon't listen to other people's negativity, do what you feel is right.  It shouldn't matter if your German,or what you look like...People are mean because their not happy with them selves and have to take it out on someone else....just don't try to make a Superior race and everything will be fine:)....Because you look like Adolf hilter!Maybe people assume that it is not your real name, that you are making a political statement and supporting Hitler or something. Some people are extremely judgemental. I would say just ignore those immature people. There's a famous saying: . . "Be who you are and say what you feel, because those who mind don't matter and those who matter don't mind."because it is the name of the infamous Hitler.  I don't and won't judge you based on you name because I don't know you from the next person.  maybe try to change your screename to a different 1.  . Oh, and by the way, i do like your name and I am part German and part Italianbecause I'm a magnificent bastard, and I can...Maybe if you put a smile on that face instead of a scowl your responses would be better. As for being German...hopefully that has nothing to do with it.If someone does not liek you just becase of you name that is stupid. they should get to know the person that you are.because of stupid questionstheir just insecure. i dont see anything wrong with your nameA name to kill eh!Unfortunately, there are a lot of immature people on here who give way to prejudice just because they have nothing helpful to contribute. I don't think there's any way we can really help enlighten people through an online site, though. :(. . Regarding your other question:. http://messages.next.yahoo.com/next/threadview?bn=SEA-YahooAnswers&tid=26378&mid=26622&tof=-1&m=ts&rt=1&off=1&p=DNbnjDDdWw--it could be the name DUHBecause these people think they can act tough and treat others in ways that they may not have the nerve to do in public.  They are usually insecure with themselves and must lash out to feel that they have any worth or power.  People are just mean and rude and the fact that they hide behind a screen name makes their animosity worse. I hope that things get better for you.their misconception based on my apathy that god does not love them.they r crazy weirdo that need 2 get a life >=(Its natural. When people see you for thier first time, they judge you by looks.Because people are stupid. HITLER IS DEAD!!!!!If this really upsets you then you are taking this forum way to seriously. People suck. Don't you get it.I can't imagine why.  I also can't imagine you imagining why either.Ignore them. If you want your screen name to be your name, use it. There's no reason why someone should dictate that you change your screen name because they don't what it is.  Remember that you don't know who these people are, and they don't know you, and don't let them disrupt your enjoyment of the site.. . It's the information on the site that's important, not who provides the answers, who they are, where they're from, or what their screen name is.Don't let these people get to you. You have a German name and you are German, it makes sense to me.eaher cuz your a loser and have no friends or they were butt mulested and beat by the parentsit is just part of lifeYou picked the avatar for yourself and it does have a mean expression.  You could change the look and I really don't think people are upset with the name.Some people just like to mix it up a bit.  The world would be boring if we were all nice.Narrow-mindedness.it's the name brings back some terrible memories for many peopleIn My life- Mean People were Generally called Bullies(unless their Chicks)- it comes from within usually a need to control other people, but it is Fear that Drives those people -Mean People are Scared thats why they try to Control to overcompensate for their own shortcommings. Most of the time they are reacting to being controled
I have the same problem sometimes...It could be a slow connection, overloaded server, or a technical problem not addressed yet...yahoo maybe having problems or maybe your not typing in your password rightYahoo! has been having problem now, I see many people complaining.click on 'messenger' on ym & then click 'connection preferences'.there're 4 options.try changing it to each one of them & signing in until you are able to access ym properly.hope that helped-cheersthere have been problems with the server.  Just be patient.  Also you may want to try changing your proxy settings that sometimes helps.You have to click on this word at the top of the messanger (messanger) then select no proxes mode ,. . I did it for my problem that was same with your problem.Yahoo is having problems with its servers. Just wait a little and then try againFirst try doing a clean reinstall of messenger:. http://search1.cc.scd.yahoo.com/cct_search.php?ui_mode=answer&prior_transaction_id=753734&action_code=5&highlight_info=16789078,12,23&turl=http%3A%2F%2Fhelp.yahoo.com%2Fl%2Fus%2Fyahoo%2Fmessenger%2Fmessenger75%2Fmessenger%2Fmessenger-04.html&answer_id=6223708#__highlight. . If that doesn't work, get live support from Yahoo.  Goto http://voice.yahoo.com/voice_help.php and click on the 'Live Chat help' link on the right side of the pageYOU ARE NOT ALONE!!!! I've wanted to freakin punch a hole in the wall! Two nights ago I was logged out for no reason at all and it wouldn't log back in for anything. Yesterday morning I downloaded the very latest version of yahoo messenger and ALAS! I got logged in! But I keep getting logged out every so often for no reason and then it'll log right back in. I wrote yahoo customer service about it. I was supposed to recieve a response within 24 hours and I have yet to get it. But you know what really burns me? Is that if they're having problems with their servers or with bugs with the version of messenger...they should POST AN ANNOUNCEMENT somewhere on their site to let everyone know! They completely leave us in the dark about everything. At least on myspace when they're having a problem with something, they post a message so everyone knows. That's called good customer service. I think yahoo needs to take a few steps up in the customer service department.

Go to Yahoo Travel, Games, Shopping or Local, pick something and write a review, then it will automatically link to the 360 after few days to few weeks. After it appear on your Yahoo 360, then you click "Share Reviews" and set who can read.I think its Yahoo travel, games, shopping and local that allows you to do these. Just choose what you want to review about and click where it says write a review.
there are two ways in which that can be done.. One you can doubleclick the search box until all of your history appears, hightlight it the click delete..

It will solve ur problem.to be honest i just clear the history by going to tools,every thing u been on will clear once uve cleared ya historydid you look up something you don't want anyone to see?
If you found that a user has good answers, and some of his answer where chosen as the best  you can give them thumbs up. this is a proper way to show your appreciation to their helpful answers, it also encourages them to answer in a good way.as far as I know, you can't.Why don't u just give them heaps of questions, and let them answer all of them. Mayb that will work? I don't really no
A place to have a blog, rss feeds, meet people, stay in contact with friends, and store pictures. easy to use and funI don't know much about it.

And one place for you to stay connected to them.i also agree with the first answer. i do not know much about it but i think the first answer is write. hope it is. cya soon.. .

Weird, I've never seen that. Does it make it so you can't use the features in any way, or is just an annoying message?If you are connected to the Internet (as it appears because you can login to Yahoo!

Yahoo! does not offer the way to 'change' your actual user ID. However, you can change the display name to be a nick name. Just go to the 'Messenger' drop down field, select 'My Contact Details', enter the desired name in the 'Nick Name' field, and click 'Save and Close.'I don't think you can because i triedYou go into your account settings and change it there. If that doesn't work, your friends will have to do it on their side. It happens when your friend puts your information in the Yahoo messanger profile box.
I think the idea is that they all should end in question marks. People should Ask direct specific questions here, so other people who know what they are tlaking about can Answer.It is the grammatical nature of a question to end in a question mark or it would be a statement.Because they are supposed to be questions.. . Altho' many people aren't getting the hint.Well, this is Yahoo! Answers. Every question you post should be..a question. You could get reported for not asking a question.well, isn't it more or less common sence to end a question with a question mark?. I mean, it does say ask...

The existence of God is a very serious matter and something that deserves thought and answers.  Although it is asked a lot, it is good that people are seeking to find the answer to that and are trying to find God.  There is an almighty, loving God.I feel they find it hard to search for the similar questions.I have to agree to a degree. But in part you have answered the question yourself. There are people on here who have a tendency to clutter up the answer portion with nonsensical answers in a hurried bid to gain their two points. As a point of fact, I would give that 90% of these type of answerers never thoroughly read the questions.Because they want to hear the answer they already know and think is correct !NEVER!!! =) LOLSome times I see the same questions but most of the time there are different questions.They want to see a lot of respones,just like the repeative love questions,people get a life and forget about him/her!Probably not!  Everybody is different and the world changes all of the time.  People are always looking for a different answer to the same question.  Ask an atheist if there is a God, and he will say no!  Ask me and I will say, definitely.  Ask me if 1+1 is 2; as a mathematician and he will say, sometimes but not always depending on what specifically you are talking about!  Does 1 apple and 1 orange add up to 2?  Only if you are talking about fruit!  Know what I mean?Some people just don't understand certain answers. They want another way of answer the question. like 1+1. The ans can be 2 or it can be 11.Cause people ask the same questionThe better question is, would it be impossible? ;)exactly, just it is typical way of universal thinking. i bet you are amazed how your probable students cheat asking homework help here  LOL. . good point
first off make sure you have all sounds and emoticons off. chat invites off, and if you know who is doing it ignore them. best of luck didnt know they still booted people out of chat thought that stopped years ago (2002) when i left yahoo chat, amazing that people still have nothing better to do then boot people out of chat.Go to another room
click on that question find your answer and click delete but it will cost you pointsOn Yahoo! Answers, you cannot delete resolved or in voting questions. They stay archived as part of the Yahoo! Answers database. If the question is still open, there will be an option to delete on the question page.. . If you were talking about your search history:. Tools >> Internet Options >> Content >> AutoComplete >> Clear Formsgo to tools then internet options then clear history . . its that simple!Yahoo! Answers ought to filter all questions through a keyword file, and when it thinks a question may be one of those irritatingly repetitive inquiries (like this one), it ought to pop up the FAQ on the asker's screen, and ask if it is a reasonable match for their question.  Might make this a little more enjoyable.. . (Sheesh, I am grumpy today!  Sorry 'bout that.)If you're using Internet Explorer, go to Tools > Internet Options > Clear History.  Other browers work similar to this.click history button on the top above the address bar.... right click on wuteva link u want... ex. today. then click delete... simple...open the history box, right click,select deleteOops what happend, did you look at some bad sites and not want anyone to see it?

2 or more people talking back and forth to each other in an on going conversation..... Thats what I call chatting.. . I do not consider asking or answering questions by posting, as chatting.If you ask, say, "How are you?" that's chatting whether or not you respond. It's hard to draw a line between what is chatting or not, but the team has some examples of what is in the community guidelines. If you haven't read them already, now may be the time: http://answers.yahoo.com/info/community_guidelines.phpIt's what teenagers use, the term i think it's called it, "Lingo"Goodday, I believe your definiton is right. I think Yahoo Answers doesn't want questions that it takes more than a single word, phrase, or a link to answer.  It is kind of stupid because for most of us who know how to use a search engine and do research there are very few questions that we can ask that don't require an opinion of some sort. I have not looked at your questions but I have a feeling that another user has something against you and is reporting you knowing that the Yahoo Answers Team will probably take their word for it and not bother to research into the matter. The Yahoo Answers Team is spending too much time deleting harmless questions like "Who likes pizza?" and not enough time deleting questions like "Is my dick big?"i think this is chatting cause you wanting to know how i feel about something but with that said i also believe that most everything about answers is chatting, except for questions like "Can you tell me how to upload a photo in _ _ _ _ ?"That is asking for help but this is my personal opinion which most questions ask for. I dont care anymore.chatting: where one may ask a question or make a statement and another would respond to said question or statement.
Let me correct Lollipoppett:. . A free Yahoo! Mail account will get deactivated for inactivity/dormancy after 4 months of disuse.  If you are signing into Yahoo! sites but NOT Mail, this clock will continue to run until 4 months.  After 4 months, it gets deleted and you will need to reactivate it.  Any mail lost cannot be recovered.. . If you are certain you have been actively checking your mail, verify that you haven't violated any Yahoo! Terms of Service (TOS).  Your account may be deactivated at any time if you violate TOS.  I won't go into detail on this, because you know if you have been doing bad things or not.. . The important thing is, if you are certain you have been using your account and you haven't violated the TOS, contact Yahoo! Customer Care to investigate for a possible bug.. . Good luck!Normally that only happens if the account has been inactive for more than 90 days.. . I'd set up a new account contact your customers and go into that account every day to check. If you haven't signed into the account for more than 90 days yahpoo in their wisdom deactivate it.

Just go to the 'Messenger' drop down field, select 'My Status' and select the status you want showed to your contacts when they instant message you.

Unfortunately, just because you could select the answers to choose from responsibly doesn't mean everyone can. I would feel a bit more offended if the asker deliberately took my answer out before a vote than if he just picked a poor answer, but I can see how this would be very useful. Send in your suggestion. You can send it in directly via the "Tell us what you think" link at the bottom of the page or suggest it in the user forum linked in the upper right of this page.I pretty much just pick you, Jimbo or Gravesendian. You guys are the only ones who say anything that make sense. (With the occasional exception.). . I want to know how come you don't get points for asking a question that gets like 50 responses. Why isn't that worth something?best answer should be only one like this.....Its just something we have to live with!
It's because when you sign in your going to the offline mode. If you hit the box where it saids sign in invisable it should take it off, but to do that you have to sign out and sign in after doing so.you could be signing in as invisible.  this is an option on the sign-in screen.maybe you are invisible to everyone? see up there where it says your name then your status? click that box and hit available. it says i am always offline to my friend but i never hit offline and she didnt block me and i didnt block her. it may just be a glitch.There is a setting in your mail account on yahoo for showing as offline..gimmie a minute here..... OK...Mail options, then choose account details then go to edit/create profiles....uncheck the box for hide me. . That oughta get it

I found it thru yahoo homepage. They had given a link to it. I hv been participating in yahoo answers since December 27, 2005.I found out about Yahoo! Answers about a month ago (in May, 2006) when a friend recommended it to me. I'd seen the banners when I'd go to the Yahoo! home page and in other places but I, honestly, ignored them and wasn't the least bit curious. So, based on my friend's recommendation I tried it and have been addicted ever since.. . Do I thank my friend? Do I curse my friend?. . I haven't left my apartment since May. I have food delivered, sleep on the floor in front of my computer and wash my clothes in the bathtub.. . Some friend.i just found out about a couple of weeks ago just messin around on the computer at work . kinda like what I'm doing now. oh no I've said too much.....Yahoo e-mail, in May this year.I just  found out in Juneum... i actaully think i acidentally click on it or sumthin when i was doin stuff with my BEAUTIFUL aviator!!! ;) .... it was a few weeks ago...in Junei just found it today its awesome another good site for advice is www.wondir.comjust found out a couple wks ago. i was searching something on yahoo home page and the "yahoo answers" link came upI just found a link on one of the Yahoo! pages, and thought I'd start using it. I've been here since April.I found yahoo answers a couple of months ago so around March or April I think it wasApril.just truing to check my mailI found out in April.. . LClast month, and I honestly don't know what power-that-be directed me here.Last two months. I posted my questions and got great answers. :)I kept coming across these ads for Yahoo! Answers, and finally decided to check it out. I didn't know what "beta testing" meant though. I don't remember when I first came here.I found it about four months ago.  There was something about it on the Yahoo! home page; I think it was a question about what to do about a relationship problem.  I thought that I could help out, so I answered.  I don't do it all of the time, but sometimes it can be quite fun and rewarding.  I'm really not interested in the points, I'm not sure I even understand them.  (Has anyone looked at the points leaders by the way?  There is something fishy about the person who has answered all the boxing questions.  Like, first off, who is asking all of these boxing questions?)  I find it very telling to read about some of the problems that people are mulling over and the desire to seek answers on this website.I got an e-mail and it was in June.that is such a stupid question get a life ll sikeI found it yesturday and i was changen my avatar and it popped up on the slide show on the first page.I'm not sure it just popped up this month and I've been hooked ever since.in my yahoo tool bar and this monthI found out about Yahoo Answers last week (June) I was bored and just came across it while playing on my laptop.I ran across it around the middle of June & I've been here ever since!on the att page this monthI went to check my Yahoo mail and i saw it, the announce. This month.i was searching on yahoo and i found it this monthI learned about yahoo answers last month on June 4 when designing my avator.  I learned about avatars in a class in powerpoint level 3 at the school where I teach and am obligated to take 12 hours a year in computer technology.was trying to find something out(song lyrics)and stumbled onto this a couple of weeks ago & havent looked backi just got an email like today about it!hmm, why does it matter? get off my case!

The same 14 year old boys hang out in the dating section. Because that's where they have the most to say.Who knows how many gays are answering questions in the 'Science & Mathematics' section or the 'Home & Garden' section? You really don't expect them to say:. . "First of all. I am homosexual. Second of all, Heisenburg's Uncertainty Principle can be explained in the following way...". . The LGBT section is the only one specifically about homosexuality, so of course the answers there are going to be about LGBT. Alternately, you would not expect the following question:. . "What is Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle? By the way, I'm gay". . to be posted in LGBT, would you?they think they're superior to the rest of the world, they're in there planning on turning the whole world gay.probably because birds of a feather flock together.I don't know . Ask them!. Probably they felt rejected from the rest of the world and only in that section they feel OK .Because they are family and I am sure they don't always answer in that section.cuz they're gayyou know if you have things in common with others you tend to gravitate to " like " people. Another reason is MAYBE they are asking an honest question and don't want to wade thru a lot of answers that are more " bashing " their lifestyle than answering their question.

by the use of feed u can directy share information of yr other blog or yahoo answer or another web to  yahoo 360. for other information chat with me. i cant give u full info hear. bye. take careIf you've seen orange RSS or XML buttons on websites, those are for feeds. We'll use your Yahoo! Answers feed as an example. There is a small link in the bottom right of your Q&A page that says RSS. Here's the link: http://answers.yahoo.com/rss/userq?kid=c8d0c701fc1d8a650e26bed8f3798fc1aa. . Paste it into your Yahoo! 360 page where it asks you to. After your page is updated, it should display the name of the feed (Questions from you) and a list of items (well, this question). If you asked another question, then the next time it updated your second question would start showing on Yahoo! 360 as well.. . Usually, the feeds on 360 are for users who have blogs on other websites. They can just use the RSS feeds from those sites to display the links to the blog entries on their 360 page. Here's my 360 page as another example. I have a couple of other feeds listed so you can see what they look like.. http://360.yahoo.com/chavezjrfan. . I hope this helps.

go to download.com  search for a program called no ads.  Download, and Install it.  When you get a pop up, open the program. there will be 2 boxes.  The top box will have the address where the popup is from.  Next, under the top box, it will have a button that says add.  Select the site in the top box by clicking on it one time, click add.  It will then appear in the bottom box.  The bottom box holds all of the pop ups that you add to it.  It takes a little bit to take advantage of the program.  So whenever you get a pop up, leave it on the screen, open the No Ads program, click the link in the top box, click add, and the pop up will disappear.  If the same pop up tries to come up, the No ads program will automatically kill it.  The No Ads program runs in the background.what kind of pop up blocker you got ???depends on pop up blocker you have.
If you deleted an email, it will be in your TRASH folder.  However, if it is no longer in your trash folder than it is GONE FOREVER.  There is no way of retreiving an email that is gone from your trash folder.If it is in the trash than click on the one you want and there shuld be an icon that asks,"do you want to restore this email?" than click yes or no. Hopefully this helps!!!Take a look in your trash folder.. I think deleted emails stay in there for about 5 days so you may be able to get it back.. If its not in there, get your friend to email it back to you again.It depends on how long ago it was if it was today you can go 2 trash and check and see if it is in there.it should be in the trash section I do that all the time on accidentcheck your TRASH folder or DELETED ITEMS folder and then send it back to inbox.u look in ur trash folder... if u deleted everything in ur trash folder, ur in trouble.

Possibly because there are less people who know more than those that know less. And we all came here looking for answers ... not to answer one.mayb they got less IQ or info.....?I have answered way more questions than I have asked!. . My way out there guess is that most people want to help others rather than be helped themselves?!?  i.e it is easier to give advice than take it - human nature?!?there cant be because they need to answer more questions than ask in order to ask questions. their are also greater limits on the amount of questions you can ask than those you answerI don't think that's correct. There are more people answering questions rather than asking them.. . Check various users profiles and you will find statistic like Questions Asked 2 and Answers 170. Actually that might be from my profile. . . Check the leaderboard, and you will find that these people with the maximum points have answered 1000's of questions but asked only 1 to 5 themselves.seems to me like its the other way round  : SGosh, how do know that? I think I have answered way more than Ive asked."everybody wants to go to the party but nobody wants to pay the DJ". - Steve

Why?  Because there is a crapload of people out there typing like idiots, trying to be the first, and it seems like everyone hits the Preview/Submit button at the same time.  You didn't think you were the only one out there answering this stuff, did you? :)  I will bet that when I hit Submit, there will be a bunch ahead of me, plus some idiot putting something like "cuz" down, just to get some points without using brain cells.it dose that to me toi its normal dont worrie!!!!!!!!because when it said there were no answers, some people had already seen that and typing up their answer, and while you are typing yours, they have already submitted theirs.People are answering at the same time....how in the hell would i know!!! but good ? it happens to me too!!! :-)cuzit does that to everybody i be thinking i'm the first one to and then when i hit sumbit all the other 100 of them come popping up.I don't think they want people to be able to see anyone else's answers before they post their own. That's what I'm getting from it.You type to slow.Because the people are all answerring at the same time so Yahoo! dosn't have enough time between when the people answer and you see their answes. Also because Yahoo! dosn't review all questionslol...This happens to me as well. People are probably in the process of answering as your reading the question...ppl may type faster...a lot of things it could be I supposeEverybody has the same thought as you do.Because the whole world (due to different timing zones) and Internet speeds , if it said this question is asked 3 seconds later, it means 15 or much more, as you type your answer, mocking and joking people answer it already, have patience
You can't set Yahoo account in Outlook because Yahoo not offer POP3 Mail service at free Yahoo accounts... . You have to use Internet Explorer...I'm assuming you are already subscribed to Yahoo! Mail Plus.  If not, you will need to do so.  POP access is not available for free Yahoo! Mail accounts (except Canada).. . Here's where you can sign up for $19.99 a year.  It's worth it.. .    http://mailplus.mail.yahoo.com. . The settings are as follows:. .    POP server:  pop.mail.yahoo.com.    PORT:  110.    SMTP server:  smtp.mail.yahoo.com.    PORT:  25 or 587. .    ACCOUNT/LOGIN:  your Yahoo! ID.    PASSWORD:  your case sensitive password. . You will need to enable SMTP authentication in order to send outgoing messages!  Each POP mail client has a slightly different term for this, but basically it's the same thing.  The mail client submits your login and password in base64 encoded clear text.  Without this, you will NOT be able to send emails via SMTP.. . VERY IMPORTANT NOTE:  Mail Plus is only available to U.S. customers with a .com account.  If you are from outside the U.S. but have a .com account, you can still use it as long as your preferred content setting in "My Account" shows "Yahoo! U.S." (or "United States - English" or "English - U.S." depending on what you currently have configured for your language setting).Open up to mail main page- go into options (top right)then pop access and forwarding. Just follow the instructionsyes ... use "Tools" in the main menu of Outlook Express then go to "Accounts", after that ADD your Yahoo account info.. . Good LuckI dont think its possible, dude.You need to have a POP or IMAP mail server in-order to configure it in Outlook. Yahoo don't offer pop or imap access in the free edition, you need to purchase the Yahoo! Mail Plus if you need POP access. It will cost you $35 per year.

The reason would be to induce us to answer and not just ask.  You get two points for every question you answer and 10 points if your answer is chosen as best answer.  Since you start out with 100 points, you must do some answering (and/or voting) or after you ask 20 questions (which cost you 5 points each) you would no longer be able to ask questions.  Anyway, how much fun could this site be if everyone asked and no one answered?NO PRIZES. .

Hah, I love it. They create this fun new exciting updated hip version of Messenger and put this nice question and answer thing...but the folks at Yahoo aren't even paying attention!! Sorry, I don't have an answer, I've just got the same problem. When I click on my buddies the dern thing crashes.........I have the same problem.  I uninstalled and reinstalled and still nothing.

you can make most of your 360 private/friends only. (Start with contact settings, change your settings and then push the save and continue, do this until you are back where you started, and save)  As long as she is not a friend, or friend of friend... etc....  unactivate (is that a word?) your simple url... people can still find you thru friends, but not from a straight address.  I hate it for you that someone is being so hateful, maybe, once she is unable to see anything for a while, you can set your settings back for the world to share.with a privacy setting of "Just Me." This means only you can see your photo, ur profiles, blog or albums on your 360 page. . To sharing your photos, change the privacy setting.. u decide how private or public to make ur 360  by setting ur permission preferences.. Goodluck ^_^make it private to your friends only....Go to your 360 Yahoo! Account preferences and click "friends only" to block the other persons from viewing your page!
Sometimes its a combination, when you answer a question, that exact second you received either a thumbs up for your answer to a question, visiting the Y! answer website, and Your question has picked a best answer by vote.it is all based on how you and others answer the questions  the best answer gets 10 points...it happens when you answer questions consecutively over a short period of time..Maybe some rates your answer or chooses your answer as a best answer while you're answering a question. The next time you're on a page that gives you points, it all adds up. . . I know I've had several best answers when I've logged in some days, so I see a message telling me that I've received however many points since I last logged in.Maybe you got a thumbs up rating and points for visiting and answering a question..

Dumb question. I'm sorry, but that's just unnecessary. Beauty comes naturally, there isn't a 'how to' guide.Have your camera still and use the 30 second button,. then just look up or down not into the camera and there  ya have it, and use natural settings is good too.If the doorbell rings while in the nude, keep quite and do not answer the door bell before getting dressed..remove clothes..must feel unrestricted..make sure weather is warm..or the room itself..relax your whole body..let all stress unwind..then with creative eye, snap away!flowers, food arrangements..pets..I would never take a picture nude of myself, but I guess I just lack in self-confidence! But it all comes from artistic style, like shadow, theme, background, colours, contrast and etc. Think beauty when taking a photo1) Call Pizza Hut and get their Dunkin Stix. 2) Strip. 3) Wait patiently for pimpled-face teenage boy. 4) When doorbell is rung, offer 3 dollar tip to take one photo of your discusting, old man body.. 5) Get arrested. 6) Share photos with your cellmate in the county pen. . Good luck!  :)  Best wishes, old fart!very carefullyClick the button on your camera when it has someone in focus that is nude...take them with the clothes offOn the mountain, with the moonlight. If you've seen the movie "A Lot Like Love", then you know what I'm talking about. That was an awesome picture taken!* have ur best friend to take them*Grab your camera.  Take your clothes off.  Then take some pictures of other things.With your picture you cant. Sorry im Just Kidding.
Hit refresh when you see you have a new message. You must have read the new message, but the page you're on doesn't know that. Refresh and it should make it all better.Must be a error. Just ignore it.I feel that a file on the 'current' version may have been corrupt.  Try having a friend send another voice message to you, upgrade the software to version 7.5, and see if the voice message appears.  There is much more functionality and performance enhancements from 7.0 to 7.5.
when you start typing an email, it starts out in drafts.. if its not saved on your email application then it maybe on the server for some time then it delete's itselfDepending on the email provider, letters that are not saved to your local hard drive are automatically deleted after a determined amount of time.  This conserves space on their servers.  If your document isn't visible anymore I'd say they zapped it.. . Items placed in the trash folder are either deleted immediately when you end the session or within a short span of time... like a couple of weeks.in saved messages

The problem you are experiencing is a known issue with the Launchcast plugin. I believe it will be fixed and released soon.. . In the meantime, you can get around the problem by setting your skin to the Classic skin. You can do this from Messenger->Change SkinI've found that closing the Yahoo! Music plug-in, then re-opening fixes it. Click the arrow in the right corner of the plug-in, then click "Close". Now click the big "Plug Ins" button, click the "My Plug-ins" tab, find Yahoo! Music in the list, and click "Start".

From the Messenger drop down menu - choose My Contact Details, change them to how you want it to be read and then click on Save & Close.  When you add a new contact to your list, make sure the details you want shown are up before clicking on Okay.  That should do it for you - have fun chatting!you can take your name out of your user profile and check the box for private  when setting up your user info.
Go to Yahoo Help, I'm sure u will faind the answer. n_n GOOD LUCK... ok, wait I will find out !It's not the greatest service for customer assistance.  They do not understand your problem.  Maybe the service is out-sourced to another country and it is too difficult for them to understand what you really need because when you have a problem you may not ask the question in a way they know how to answer.  I have had this problem with many out-sourced  customer service representatives.
If you have addresses in your address book, then when you are forwarding, you have to click on >insert addresses< and then just check off the ones you want to use and then>insert checked contacts<. Done!i dont know but you can find in on Yahoo Help. (i think ur address book should be empty)what?
she's right.  Even if you haven't gotten confirmation on the friend thing... then they are your favorites... and you will see whoever updated last on the top of that list... if the people with FEEDS are making you crazy, you can look to the bottom of that page and see a link to choose not to see the feeds as first, but only the REAL entries.If it's showing up on your home page in 360 it's because they have updated something on THEIR page. Anytime any of your friends update anything on their page it will do that.
I am not aware that it is possible to archive chat rooms on your your buddy contacts if it abled in your preferences to save them.Then to view your buddies archives click on contacts & choose which buddy you need to read for the information.Sorry if this doesn't help.Good luckYahoo! does not offer archives for chat.  They only offer archives for instant messaging through Yahoo! Messenger.
either you can press (at the same time) ctrl+f. or u can see if they have their messenger icon on as a pic. or a smiley face.if they appear available on lineit should show who's available, who's busy, who's offline, etc. when you sign in.
default? you can make ur login automatic..when ur computer starts..Sorry I don`t know.
reported punk!!! that's right, i clicked on your report button, i hope you get the boot, ahhhh!!! wait, the fan club, oh yeah, never mind, i will retract my report, everything will be ok, and to clear things up, rin tin tin could beat the sh!t out of scooby doo any day, b!tches!!I'm finding that some people are confusing constructive criticism with abuse.  Hey, if you ask a question, you run the risk of getting answers you may not want to hear.  Just because you don't agree with it doesn't make it abuse.Because  their are some questions I would deem inappropriateYeah i know some of these people need to take the stick out of their assI guess some ppl just misunderstand the questions because they aren't spelt right or they are misleading maybe!!!. . . ILOL maybe some people feel abuse by the answer not. the ? I myself won' t let words bother me. Thats all they. are just words. But also people dont want to see words. like f***  S*** c** B****** u know what i mean, but I dont care either a word is a word OKkkkkkSurely reports need to go through another source first.  Maybe therein lies the problem.  Too strict on questions.they can report all they want, Yahoo has the final say. It's a good and needed option for those that can't play nice on the Net.really, i have been wondering the same thing about from some time, my RESOLVED questions of weeks ago, are NOW being reported abuse, this is rediculous, ppl just can't stop being mean.because yahoo has given everyone a choice of whether or not we want to hear or see bad things,stupid things etc.. and this site was created for people to gain some knowledge,not for play!if they want play then they can go to a chat room.also all the play bogs down the website!Because they have nothing better to do, than to make someone on here miserable. I can see reporting things like very sexually explicit questions and things like that. But, just to report someone for nothing, is wrong and just plain ignorant on their part.ure so right and I agree with you 100 percent some people on this site just take thangs to personally for real--some questions need to be reported if inappropriate but other simple questions that just give you a laugh come on everyone needs a laugh from time to timeSome people are just out there to ruin your day.  theyll do it for nothing...just so you miss out on ur question and no one can answer it...geeze peopel these days lol...good question..but i cant really answer it lol..you need one of those people who love to hit that button to reply...that is ofcourse if they dont find this question abusive lolI only report people who use profane language...or who do not actually ask questions....I hate that the most.. I read 800 lines of question...only to find out there IS NO FRIGGIN' QUESTION!  huff...puff...okay, I'm better now.. . lolWell I can answer this one because I got my hands smacked twice. Once for a question and another for an answer to a question. A lot of people get on here and think that every word that is typed here is in violation of the guidelines.. . They will pick a question or and answer to pieces just to see if it is with-in there satisfaction and if they find something out of context well then there goes the mouse straight to report abuse.i do report questions that involve loving your 12 year old neighbor when you are forty.  there is a problem with that.. and since i cant do anything about it, i would hope that yahoo removes the qeustion.. . other stuff i really dont care about.  its the internet, its not serious (mostly) on here so if its all in fun and not offensive then so be it.Well, I report a lot of Internet trolls. Recently, a user that was harassing me got their account deleted. I was feeling victorious (They really deserved it!) for a little while, but then they got another profile and changed one letter in it. There is a big difference between constructive criticism and insults. Trust me, I deal with it almost every day. In other words, criticism in any form does not belong on a board that is meant for good-mannered people to share knowledge. I have received answers that are informative and respectful, and yet others are immature and scornful. If you are one of those people that use Yahoo! Answers to offend others, then you disgust me and I WILL report you.
You will win a new vehicle when you get to level 7.. . Thanks for the messege calling me a liar! That made my day!Not a damn thingTheir credits you earn by answering and spend by askiong a question.The points are mostly just an incentive for people to start answering questions, and also to vote on other answers, and finally, to rate other people's answers.  As you increase your points and levels you are able to perform more of the standard activity - ask, answer, rate, vote and comment.. . Other than that, the points don't do anything. You do get some extra 'attention' at higher levels, but that may or may not be a good thing. There are no secret special prizes, at least none that any of us at Level 7 have heard of.. . Mostly, just enjoy the site, ask and answer questions. If you like, keep track of your points as you move up in levels. After awhile, you'll be more interested in responding to people's questions with quality answers.. . Here's the link where you can see what the different levels are and how to earn points. http://answers.yahoo.com/info/scoring_system. . Welcome to the site!Means your more addicted to Q&A then others are.Those aren't points they're seconds that you have left before you die, and answering questions gives you two more seconds to live, which is just enough time to answer another question so you don't have to die.

you put some weed or hash in the brownies and eat them. make sure you use actual weed and not the leaves, leaves don't get you high. and if you use hash make sure you "cook" it first so its not hard. just put some flame to it crumble it up and enjoy. . but its really better to just smoke that stuff instead you get a better high and you don't have to waste an entire bag to get a buzzYou dont smoke the brownies you eat them. I have no idea who was bored as hell and high as hell one day that they decided to throw that in the mix but it works!!!! ;)'Special' Brownies are indeed made with pot leaves baked into them for a nice little well druggingYou can either bake the ground-up marijuana into the brownie batter and eat them, (and get high) or smoke the weed first, then eat the brownies because you have the MUNCHIES.Brownies plus pot in them make "special brownies".Nothing ... unless you bake them with pot in them and eat them for a high. It was popular in the 70s.You've never heard of "Special Brownies?"  They've been making them for years.  If you watch the reruns of "That 70s Show," you'll see an episode where Hyde makes special brownies (for the teens) and regular brownies (for the adults) - and the trays get mixed up.  Red and Kitty and company are all stoned.Some potheads like to bake brownies with weed in it and eat it for a highWhen you add pot to brownies then you have a whole pan of love.
I suspect that is is a method for controling the volume of questions.  You have seen how one question generates a huge volume of smart ass, irrelevant, and downriright ignorant answers.  I think Yahoo's message, here is that you have to earn the right to post questions.. . Let's see if someone from Yahoo posts an official answer.if u are smart u dont ask questions - that what they think... :)i was wondering the same thing but didnt feel like asking the question. thanx for posting.It's just the way their system works...you could start a site where people are given points for asking questionsbeacause everybody has questions. but they need answers to keep it working and keep this proccess together. so it only makes sence that you get points for answering and get points deducted for asking.yeah but you get points back when u pick best answer or someone picks your answer as bestWell, probably because if you are stupid enough about a subject to have to ask a question you should penalized. . Does it really matter?I wondered this at first myself. Then I saw the sheer volume of inane questions that get asked in this forum. I think it is to keep people from flooding the system with pointless or duplicate questions. I also imagine that they want people to search through the resolved questions for answers before posting a duplicate: so the system works as a knowledge base. I have had success doing that without wasting my points... . . Not that the points seem to be valuable for anything much.I was actually wondering that same thing yesterday. It's retarded. We should get points added for asking a question because we are getting more involved. They should change it and give you 5 points for asking a question.I still ask questions, who cares how many points you have. It's not like it means anything in real life.I think they deduct points when you ask a question so that you would ask a question only if it's worth it, or a good question. It makes you think about your question more.. . If they gave you points for asking questions, people would ask stupid questions all the time (and some do anyway!) just to get points.. . I think they also want to make sure that you answer someone else's questions in order to get points, and that makes you participate more actively in the community. . . They do give you points for choosing a best answer though, so it sort of makes up for it.The idea was that in order to ask questions, you had to build up points by answering questions asked by others.  They start you off with enough points to ask 20 questions, but if you want to ask more, you have to start giving back to the Yahoo Answers community by answering others' questions.

Preform a search of your mail. Put "Yahoo Answers" in the field and check the box at the top where it has sender then hit deletecheck it and deleteDo a very specific search to make sure only those show up in the search results. Check all, delete. Do that with each page of results and that's it.
Yahoo! has been having problem now, I see many people complaining.been having a few problems 2. busy server. i tried deleting and re-installing but it didnt work either.glad I looked on answers, I thought it was just mine.  Lets hope its sorted soon.it is yahoo's server.  I have been having problems all morning.  It just goes on and off.  It should fix its self soon.  I hope.I don't know what's happening but my msg doesn't work too!And I have an urgent problem to resolve on msg!Pls WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOORK!!!!!!!!!!!!!     .  :Dtried changing my proxies and it dont work..darnHi. The problems are occurring with a lot of Yahoo users currently.....apparently Yahoo is doing updates or their system may be down. I'd try again in 30 minutes or so.Same here msg not working...Some problems with yahooIt doesn't seem to be working for alot of people this morning.  You like the 5th or 6th person who asked.i'm having the same problems since last night and i'm getting really fed up. are they having technical problems or something? coz if they are, they better get it fixed as soon as possible! they should be sending warnings or announcements to yahoo users through email.Last week, there were some intermittent login issues last that affected many of the Yahoo! Messenger users (and some Yahoo! Mail users). While it wasn’t an issue to login to Yahoo! Answers, as you can see that those affected by the login issue were able to come on here and ask questions, some Yahoo! sites/products were affected. This intermittent issue occured from June 20th - June 22nd.
At the top of every page in little blue writing there's a link that says 'Forum', click that, and post your problem in there. It can take a while to get a reply, so be patient. Keep checking back, and if after a day you've still no response then reply to your own thread by typing *bump* or adding some extra details to it, and that will send it back to the top of the page.you go and report itdid u checked your keyboard?go to the button that say "report" HELLO!?!?!?!At the bottom of the page there's a link labelled "Tell Us What You Think."  Click on it and it will give you a feedback page.well stop swearing in all your posts then granny!Go to the feedback page here:. . http://add.yahoo.com/fast/help/us/answers/cgi_feedback
when a user hit submit, and the question appears for users, there would be a chance that another 10-20 users reading it at the same time. So if you hit the submit button for your answer, there would be a great chance that another 3-5 users has submitted 1 or 2 seconds before you. that is why you see the new 6 answers once you post yours.yea dats true. idk why it does that.This has always happened at times. There are people constantly answering the newest questions so they're likely to be answering at the same time that you are. Theirs just get submitted barely before yours does so they only show up after you answered.
For me, I don't like any of those cartoony choices Yahoo leaves us.  I just haven't got around to creating one of my own.  I am a brilliant designer, and I just know my avatar will knock your socks off.. . Just you wait.because we don't really care...i have yet to see anyone who looks like these avatars...what's the point?I plan on it , but maximus is right I haven't taken the time to understand how yet1. Some people just come on here to ask one question and never bother creating the avatars to go with it.. . 2. Yahoo! Avatars don't really reflect what most people look like.. . 3. Some people don't have the web browser requirements to create an avatar.. . 4. Some people like to remain as anonymous as possible.Because the grey boxed smiley people look most like meBecause they don't know how.Avatars, even though you might think so, do not have enough attributes and varialbes to accurately reflect the different types of people that use Yahoo.  I had an avatar, but it did not equitably reflect who I was so I got rid of it.I don't want to and you cant make me !!!!!Some of them may have. I've seen my answers next to a image which isn't my avatar.they don't know howMy name is G.B. Smiley.
There might be lot of people accessing the same thing at once and it's causing a hold up for some people.Its just throwing its "once a week" dicky fit............only this week it will probably happen more often.  Everyone planet wide has had problems today so you are not alone.............it sux but what can we do?. . ~What they can do is put out server status on their homepage when things are going wrong, but do they, would they? Nah they can't be bothered.. . Writing to them don't help anyway even they suggest you report it. Should have seen the email they sent me earlier........just wish they would "read" what I put before they reply with a stupid answer.Yahoo woke up this morning with a real bad hangover. I think it is still recovering.Yahoo seemed to have a problem with thier North America Server farms this morning. This problem has been resolved from this users perspective @  10:30 CDT
Well really, asking a question, only cost you 2points! Because when you vote on an answer that someone gave you, you will instantly get 3 points back! Do you pick a best answer? If not, you won't get the 3 points back.You're insane! Questions should be encouraged. I remember when asking a question only cost you three points... ahhh those were the days.Yea or maybe 6 1/2.there wont be anyone to answer your qns if it was not that waythe better question is if you ask too many questions can you go file for point bancruptcywas you asking this really worth 5 points?4 3/4lol dont give them that idea they will do it. . lol please...i dont think they should cost 6 i like it the way it is
Click "My Contact Details" in the Messenger menu, then edit the name or nickname fields to however you want your name displayed.. . Note this only affects the display on *your* computer. Others will see you however they have you saved in their address book.Open Yahoo! Messenger, go to Mesenger >>> My contacts >>> Change your with whateva you want to appear
Why don't you ask him directly weather he plays yahoo answers? He can use any id to do answers and may just hide his yahoo address. It will be impossible to trace...he probably may use another email on yahoo any way u need to know his screen name here then u can search on yahoo search bar.                     good luckdepends what his nick name is on here use the advance search that is what i did but a lot of people use different names on here i know i do
you do ABC in he like you OKwell, dont write him a letter..... . and if talk is one of your options, i take that as you havent done that before, maybe you should?!depends if you know him, like if uve known him for awhile then u start getting hints that he likes u or he likes u as a friend, i think you should talk, then ask him if he likes u, like after youve talked to him for awhile...then if that all works out go on a date!!! good luckTo paraphrase your question, I think you are asking what to do in a situation where you like a certain boy.  Start by talking.  The other two are too quick early on.  Good luck!sorry lol but what you said ? :-)C.CI think you should ask one of your bestest friends and tell him or her to ask the boy you like if he likes you back .well your question is not clear to me but if you like him and he dosen't know you i'll tell u to chose C
at the bottom of the blog entry....says create poll.....type your question there and then  you can put how ever many optional answers you want for your question....then save!!!Go to your Blog page. . At the bottom right hand corner where the text frame is. You know were you put all your creative stuff, there is link "Add Poll" click there and it automatically embeds the Poll.. you just add your questions. Your done.
Since you are using Y! Answers, I guess you use Yahoo's search engine, or if not, you should give it a try - it has been improved a lot recently.that is a software program / website whose primary function is to provide & searches a database & gathers & reports information that is related to specified terms. like as yahoo search engine, MSN search engine, Goggles search & windows search & many more ^_^
Yahoo only allows you to delete so many contacts per day if you delete to many you will find they just keep coming back delete them slowly like 3 everyday.. . And to the other person who answered that link suits you if you don't know the answer don't reply!learn how to use yahoo! and delete them properly!!!!
that's weird that they have pollution since they are underdeveloped, i guess just do what we are trying to do for our countryIs the pollution drifting in from nearby industrial areas?  There's probably not a lot you can do to stop it from coming your way.  Can you move to a place where the air is cleaner?
open up your computer, you should see a black piece that says "pentium" on it.  that is the YM auto update implant.  yank it out of your computer and throw it against the wall as hard as you can.  you wont get any more YM updates.There's no way to do it without hacking your system, as the 2 answer explains.. . You can tell Yahoo what you think about it:. http://add.yahoo.com/fast/help/us/messenger/cgi_feedbackclick start > run type %programfiles% click OK the program files folder will pop up in there find yahoo folder double click on it then the messenger folder find the yupdater file and rename it to yupd or delete it and it will stop asking u to update.
if you have a Yahoo! e-mail address, when you check your e-mail, click on options (which should be on the top right of the page), then go to block addresses and enter in the addresses you want to block. Depending on the source, you can block an entire domain. You should also be able to mark the unwanted mail as SPAM and the message should be deleted, and the address of the sender automatically blocked.use your filter or block the email and tht will block thm in future. (depends what server etc your using)yup, TOOLS, Options...use the BLOCK SENDER option, or CREATE RULE FROM THIS MESSAGE...with this you can specify which words in the subject line will cause the mail to be deleted before it even arrives in you mail box.....usual words to highlight are like viagra, Free, penis enlargement, drugs, loans...all the usual spam bollox,You could block a certain e-mail address at the "Options" and "Block Addresses" then add the e-mail address(es) that you want to block. Hope that helps...If its yahoo, copy the email address by selecting it and pressing control c, go to options, click on block email addresses and paste the address in to it, and yahoo will block it from then on.
Exactly what i was thinking . There are some question's that deserve stupid answer's because they  are totally stupid question's but i know you had a legit question but there are those that just have to be smart butt's and can't just be nice.because some people are retardcuz their stupid! people find enjoyment out of making other people's lives miserableYes, why can't we just have fun?All because their cell phone battery died on them and their computer froze up on them ,too...  So that shot that person's day all to hell,and they go on this site to vent their frustrationYes people are just so rude! They just think they are the best here. It is just so rude. I mean if they dont have anything nice to say they shouldnt say anything.Becuase they are rude people.There are a lot of reason's. Maybe they can't afford to go to the doctor without being 100% sure that they should. Maybe they just want the opinions of other's. Maybe they have seen a doctor, and just didn't get the diagnosnis they wanted to hear. Most of all maybe they just can't think of another question to ask.Some people don't like doctors and would rather have alternative methods of getting diagnosed, but they shouldn't be rude about it. I think it maybe because whatever they are asking about makes them behave that way :P or they're just rude people."Can't we all just get along?" Guess what if you are in authority people will naturally resent you and be a little rude. That's life. Sometimes you meet nice people and sometimes you meet rude people. Not everybody can be in a good mood all the time. Don't worry about one jerk just move on.yeah totally!!!!!! i think they feel so much more empowered when they make someone feel less important. i hate it...
Strange, try contacting Yahoo.  You might actually have to call them on the phone and speak to a live person.  Perhaps someone has hacked your account or something.. Good Luck!Well if you got banned, they probably don't want you in there.. . Try contacting Yahoo directly: http://add.yahoo.com/fast/help/us/messenger/cgi_messenger7_5
This issue should be resolved. It was caused by a temporary server configuration issue, should have only lasted roughly 1 hour last Friday (June 16th, 2006).Akamai is for loading images, so you're safe to just click OK.YE i know i just had the same thing, I ignored it , and it looked a bit different than usual YAhoo mail, but its fine...
under  yur answer is a blue underlined words saying edit/delete. Press the delete one and it should delete it.i think it has already been resolved and probably can not delete it now... i do not think it takes a month to resolve a question...so i know it is to late to worry about deleting it...If your answer is in a resolved question, there is no way to delete it. Sorry.. You can always contact Yahoo and have them delete it for you if you feel that strongly about getting rid of your answer.Should be deleate under your answerwell, a month ago ?? sorry u can't do it...u can del. an answer if it is of few mins. back.
There should be a dropdown window letting you to use either ID's, thats only if you have it set in your profile. Look 2 c what it is set to for your default ID also!Because you need to type in a nickname in ur profile
No. I don't think so. You have to start from scratch.YAHOO!!! DISCOVERIf you go into your Yahoo Answers account and pick edit info, you can change your nickname and change the link to a different email, if you want. I think all your data will stay with you.NoYou can change your user name on your account you have now.
As far as I'm aware, the Mail Beta blocks anything in an email message which sends a request to an outside server, that is, something that is not already on the email, like linked images until you give it permission to load them. In this way, there is little way for spammers to know if their spam reached your inbox, as many use what are known as web beacons, content that a message loads which lets the sender know the message was opened by seeing if it was opened on the server.disable the reading pane so whenever you select something, thats all thats happening.  I personally dont care about it because everything goes in my bulkmail then I have it to automatically delete everything older than a month.
The instant messages are for Yahoo! Messenger and, yes, it is free just like pretty much any messaging service. If you have it turned on when you click the link, then the instant message window should open.dude, you need to download software to use IM you idiot.  I'll give you links to download the software for AOL and Yahoo
online chatting is easy and fun. just go to yahoo chat and pick a category or room you would like to join.If you have an internet connection at home download Yahoo Messenger from Yahoo.co.in and install the same. Login using your yahoo id and search for chat rooms.hi

Make sure you've chosen "Public" with both "Yahoo! 360 Messages" and "Yahoo! 360 Invitations" on your Communication Settings. That way you don't miss out on invites from friends and messages.. . Good luck!Are you getting an error message?  You need to also clean out your sent mail.  It is also possible that the person is not receiving messages from anybody.its probably because you're invites are over the limit i believe they only allow you to send 100 invites at once wait until some Expires then delete them then you can invite more people...Hit Mailbox then on the left side you will see Invited then a number hit that and see if any has Expired. if you need more help i m me or email me and i can help you

Open ur address book. check the box of the email u want to delete, click delete, yahoo will ask for confirmation, confirm it and the email ID will be deleted.right click on that address, delete will be on there. click it and it will be deletedyahoo, u can deleat easilyIf you are using the Yahoo!

I know hotmail just automatically put my whole name (blah) and I don't really know any way to change it.
People tend to ask the same questions and never find the answer, or know how to find what they are looking for on the Internet since it is so vast. To find something, one must be extremely specific and know what they are looking for, or they'll end up going to plenty of pages filled with adware. Yahoo probably saw this trend and decided to try and make itself more popular by creating Yahoo Answers so that more people would use it, and by word of mouth, spread this around while helping out people at the same time. From personal experience, I was clueless on helping my friend with her problem and couldn't find anything on the web that would help except pages upon pages that require memberships, but when I asked the question here, I got answers I were looking for.Someone thought of it, presented to the Yahoo leadership, it was approved and instituted. That usually the way it works in business.someone got really boared one day.... lolYahoo Users Ask alot of questions so hence they had to make "Yahoo Answers" for the person who got a question
Are you under the age of 18?

okay sweetie,. You can mow lawns, wash cars, start  walking dogs for other people, but please whatever u do make sure your parents know who they are, don't jut go up to any stranger or anything, try the people in your neighbors and make sure your parents know them. I'm sure since you are 13 that you know better than to talk to strangers. Unfortunately not everyone in this world is nice, so good luck and be careful!help  around the house,deliver news papers,ask your neighbors if they need their dogs washed,or walked,collest cans,baby sitbegwash neighbours cars....................//...............Cut someone's grass. Take someone's dog for a walk. Or deliver newspapers.When I was to young to have a job I asked my parents if I could do stuff around the house. I would clean my moms car for $10 or clean the entire house for $40. Just ask your family if there is anything you can do for them. Its also summer and people are always looking for babysitters try putting up a ad at the YMCA or somewhere that says you can babysit!

AND:) somebody might Call out..."HEY!!! SUSIE!".  and i will turn around a say "YA".... so my profile name.... just cuz that is part of ME:). i happened to walk on a RAINBOW...once.... so You SEE???. hmmm....:)I love sweetpea body lotionI'm an Angelina Jolie fan and really like the Lara Croft movies.. . Plus I like to pretend I'm lady-like. :)My occupation. And my truck number....at the time.Yahoo choose for me.My last + my initialWell when i was born it was snowing outside and my family had to cross town New York at like 6 am to deliver me, i was 2 weeks late. I was born and it was almost a hudge disaster b/c of traffic and ect, also my dad was layed out in the hospital b/c of an electrical accident at his factory; so I blossomed despite adversary. And I figured Snowblossom sounded better then Trafficblossom or accident blossom.......yeah.
Umm maybe you didn't install it, instead just clicked run! That could have something to do with that, I realised that with a program the other day ... I was like wth!!!Because it may be set up as a normal windows file (?) What are you trying to do? If youre trying to remove it- go to your messenger setup file and click remove!
so that people will think twice before they flood the place with questions... some don't care about their points, but others do.  It's not really that much... answer 2 questions and vote on one resolved or in voting question and you have made your 5 pts back.  plus, you can get 3 points for just picking the best answer to your questions.... 2 of those, and you are ahead by one.ya i no i havent even asked a question yet because im tryin 2 get 2 level 2to encourage people to think twice before posting a question so that it will not be flooded with "funny" questions.You're not been force, no one force you to give stupid answers to make others angry or annoyed, if this is the way to get your every 2 points, then it meaningless, think you can get alot of your points very fast cos you can just anyhow answer as you claimed stupidly or jokingly just to get points. In order some people do mind their points.. You can too ask a stupid or serious questions by deducting 5 points, so ask wisely.. But I think some netizens really are serious of needing help when they ask for a question, which I think is good to provide them the right correct information not jokingly. The netizer wil receive your informative answer with an appreciated smile when they reading it. : ). Lastly, it up to indivdual to post their questions & answers stupidly or truly as the points will alway been given.Because you need to give something back for taking up Yahoo!'s resources and time.It simply a part of life my friend...it is simply a part of life.  We all have to deal with that...but what may seem stupid or meaningless to you, may be quite the opposite to another.  10-4?Cause they can!That ensures that the questions are generally REAL questions, and not just some inflammatory statement to get people riled up. It's a shame we can't vote to take more points away for those...Five points are deducted because it prevents people from asking too many questions, which no doubt would cause the room to be cluttered and confusing. Have you gone to a message board where the discussion involves a controversial issue or something popular? Those fill up very quickly with answers and at times, it's difficult to respond.I guess so you wont ask so many questions and lose all your points.But then again im probably wrong.haha!Yeah I dont like the - 5 points either.i like to ask more questions. i dont care about points so muchare you saving your points for a decoder ring?. I would think the answer to you question would be more valuable than pointsCome again DudeIt's probably to prevent you from asking lots of questions every day and loosing all your points.you r right. because of these points sometimes we get stupid answers. those who want points do not ask questions as they don't want to minus their points. i thik there should be other ways to encourage people to use this page. may be extra points to thought provoking questions & answers. if the question is universal , points should not be deducted. if the question is for personal enquiry then points can be deducted.The points are supposed to be secondary to the purpose.Y U give stupid answers?. Knowledge is power.I want a decoder ring....to get more answers than questionswhat a paradox (that's2 pts 4 me)tis the name of the game!Some dufus thought that 5000 minus 10 is 4995. What a maroon....Since the points are pointless, what difference does it make? There are no prizes or a redemption procedure.have a great day.becuz they dont have a brainI agree.  But when you think about it the points don't count for anything anyway.  . I get irritated that very few people respond to my questions.  I am sure there are thousands of people.  People seem to answer the dumb soap box questions or use this site to advertise. (good for them) annoying for me.Then answer the questions seriously, and don't annoy people.  If you do that, you'll get more points than you lose because you may get best answer.  Then, losing those five aren't so bad when you may have earned 40 the day before.  Then, once you pick a best answer to your question, then you get back three of those five anyway.  And if you don't want to lose any points, simply don't ask any questions.i agree with hippychickz38 because she makes sense, something some people are not capable of doingThey probably deduct 5 points because they want to discourage people from asking a million questions. Something tells me their plan didn't exactly work out :-) It was probably a good learning experience for the staff at Yahoo Answers.
Occasionally there are issues with the display for the top answerers in each category.  Several people have reported it to the Answers team and they have also noted it in the community forum.  Hopefully there will be a solution soon.Maybe the same people are giving answers that make it to the top list. It's up to the answerers to make it to the top 10 due to what they contribute. Hope THIS helps.. . $Moneydudeguy$

The blog entries stay in order by date as you post them.  Unless you delete and re-post every time you add another entry it will not stay at the topThere's no way to do this, but highlighting the entry as mentioned above is a good idea. You may also want to consider putting the link in your blast, which will always display at the top of the page.Unfortunately you can’t.  The blog preview on your “Top Page” and the first blog on your “Blog” page is always your latest entry.  . . If you don’t use the “highlighted posts” feature, I’d suggest highlighting those posts that you want attention draw to.. . Just in case you don't know how:  go to edit a blog entry, below the entry you'll see "show options".  click on "highlight this blog entry".
I was thinking the same thing. It's sad, but people probably are illiterate out there. How do they manage in the working world?their in a hurryUGH who cares??? if u get wat they mean...i mean really!!! watever...wat a waste of points to ask taht question!because no one wants to sound like a nerdThat is the new cool-super-fashion way to write.... . . (I agree with you)They are so eager to have answers that they just don't take the time... By the way right above the answer square there's a spellchecker so that proves my theory!!!Yeah,  lets blame the American's. No its the immigrants that dont have a proper education. I betmI'll get a lot of flack over this, I'm not pickin on anyone reallly.  My kids even purposly write wrong ":cuz it cul" r wht ev but omg get a grp we r all just havin fun here.We are in such a hurry ,this society, we are also not readers let alone careful readers. The status quo of accepting mistakes without consequences is prevalent. Also if there is an extra step to be taken it is avoided by people.  Too much trouble.  This is why America's weight problem exist today and continuously rises.  Not wanting to take extra steps (exercise) and have everything placed in front of us instead of working for it.Just imagine some turn in their school work, before proofreading their answer's.  On Yahoo answer's, people are to busy trying to be a smart a$$ and don't realize how stupid they even sound.. . Truth be known illiteracy is at an all time high.  They don't care how they sound this is entertainment for them.Did you really have to ask?I think their lazy. Some time they don't even ask the question correctly.Nope.when someone joined yahoo,somehow ,one is not illiterate.i do!I think most people are just used to how they type on messenger and email. They dont usually use any kind of grammar or even punctuation. I do it too. I'll only check my grammar in emails if they are professional in nature.u shouldn't ask questions that r so crude like thatIn looking back at my past questions, I found one that was worded horribly. I was soooo ANGRY that I couldn't spell or form sentences. I know, excuses. excuses.because they are sleepydumb peoplehope i sentence a write to scholar a be to need dont you. least at comprehensible it make. it into time or/and thought some put. jeez, but perfect not are people know i.Illiterate.... No, they're just trying to re-write the English languageTheir in a rush. Some people need to study, take a class, relearn sentence word structure, grammar.  I feel sorry for those who under circumstances their learning was disruppted someway or another.  Communication is so very important.Look some  people just don't think about there questions and they just think it is ok to ask anything but you and I no it's not and that is why some people get mad at some questionsI do not know what makes people do anything they do,however I do not get worried about errors in questions etc because none of us are perfect. :)because they do not careYes, they really are. Find some stats about illiteracy. I read one that said 60% of Americans are functionally illiterate. They can not read a street sign, which ought to scare us all. Good for them, coming to a place like Yahoo! to get some knowledge.[ I watch Jay Leno, too. the person who did not know what the Lincoln Memorial looked like stuck in my head.] . I just try to be patient, and try to figure out what they want. And do use spell check, it is easy to use[when it is working]. I want to hear what you have to say, and I can't if your spelling is so bad I can't read your question.. I admit it, I went back and read one of my answers, and it could have been phrased a bit better, and there was a spelling error. Oops.. And yes, people are here very late at night. I pick that reason for my own blooper. LOL. Thank you for this topic.That would be of help when attempting to answer some of the questions! Have you ever watched Jay Leno when he goes out on the street and asks questions that a 4th or 5th grader should be able to answer correctly and 9 out of 10 adults don't know the correct answer? Makes you wonder about our education system doesn't it?wel maybe its b/c yahoo doesnt chek to make sure evry1 puts alot of thought into question answerin. so u just end up w/ ppl who want pointsi always read my questions before Imseubmit them. I donet want ot loom like a fooli noe, peeps should at least make their questions legible, but once they r then who cares? u can read it, rite?I don't understand why some people get so upset if you think its not something you want to answer then don't !! If you get so upset then why be here!! I mean really!!illiterates is happening more and more unfortunately. they unfortunately don't think it's important how they come across to others. also they don't think illiterately doesn't  matters. they think broken languages and gang talk is it NOT1what be illiterate ??????????Who cares?...I mean really this isn't a job application or a college exam....it's a freakin' pastime!!! or is that... a $%^&!! pstme!Yes. Canadians are grammatically superior.I think it's even getting worse with computer lingo.... ...wat r u doin. . I do not like it !I agree with you.  At least read it over once.  If I see someone ask a question again using "witch" instead "which" I think I might scream!yup. What has this world come to? After all, there is a spell check button...DUH!I have two words for that question........Spell check!I agree with you. some don't know how to type a question. they type in  a sentence but its not a question so what are we supposed to do answer it. answer with a question? So I know what your talking about.This usually happens if there are multiple sentences/thoughts being framed in your brain while speaking or writing. The brain tries to send across the proper signals but the output is garbled as we are unable to express the same at the speed at which the thoughts are being processed by our brains.actually people are that illiterate. If they aren't, then they are lazy. I know people like to use slang. I hate it when they use slang but don't know how to spell it correctly.. Most of the people that are typing the questions you can hardly decipher have questions that are a waste of time anyway. They want points and they are putting crap out there for people to make easy points off of.  Which I don't even get the whole reason why yahoo put a point system with this, then says they don't want people to abuse the site.
choose ur category, and then click 'vote' or 'discover'. voting is fun, but it only gets u 1 point a time.voting is a nice thing............just go the discocer column and vote as much u like!!!!!!!!Go to the category that you like, then go to 'discover' and 'vote'.. Have fun!
Points get you to higher levels.......When you get to the highest level possible you achieve ultimate wisdom and Yahoo! makes you into a god for everyone to be jealous of.The more points that you get, the higher your level, the higher your level the more questions you can ask and/or answer.who knows I havent figured it out yetnothing. and the levels just mean next level. The only reward is self satisfaction of answering questions and getting pointsI don't know. . 2 more pointssame here with me, but i keep answering maybe i can be a help to someone out there, trying to be a good samaritan but in truth, just to keep me busy , than doing and waiting for the 5 :00 pm log outYou get point crazy.You start collecting and collecting,going up level after level.Then you are hooked.The points are just a goal that really means nothing.
The points just give recogintion to the user's participation. Everybody likes to be displayed on the leaderboard so everybody tries to get more and more points. We cant get anything with them except the recoginition given by Yahoo! Answersto do somethin when your boredi guess to post more qsTo encourage you to answer more questions, rate and vote of best answers. That way, Yahoo will gain more profits...the points are there so people use yahoo a lot, so it becomes popular, so it becomes effective for advertisements, so yahoo makes money (something as pointless as points, but more powerful) ideally, all people who use yahoo should not be using money, the points would have some point then.yahoo gives points, but it actually buys us.. . . change your mindsthts exactly wt i used to wonder. when i came new over here. but now since i m really addicted to it. i must tell u. theres no specific use of this yahoo answers . but yeah it gives u a lot of self satisfaction. when u answer other people's questions. it lets u know what pther people are thinking. infact u come to know new things. but u wont get any prize or sumthing like tht. its just u go on different levels. but i must warn u . its quite addictiveIt's a way for Yahoo to keep us coming back until we're absolutely addicted to it.  When you first begin, you don't have enough points to warrant getting anything in return.  So, you keep answering and answering to build up points.  By the time you realize that the points really don't matter that much, you're hooked.well in my opinion there are some real folks out there that are looking for some help & to seek some kind of advice from others & theres some fakes out there are just looking for points with dumb answers simple as that.To be the one with the most points.your mother is a pointnothing. haha. but its fun why do u think i answerd this question. for u or for the points??????????The points are mostly just an incentive for people to start answering questions, and also to vote on other answers, and finally, to rate other people's answers.  As you increase your points and levels you are able to perform more of the standard activity - ask, answer, rate, vote and comment.. . Other than that, the points don't do anything. You do get some extra 'attention' at higher levels, but that may or may not be a good thing. There are no secret special prizes, at least none that any of us at Level 7 have heard of.. . Mostly, just enjoy the site, ask and answer questions. If you like, keep track of your points as you move up in levels. After awhile, you'll be more interested in responding to people's questions with quality answers.. . Here's the link where you can see what the different levels are and how to earn points. http://answers.yahoo.com/info/scoring_system. . Welcome to the site!makes you happy,  getting more points makes you feel involvedto help you discover the hidden answers within yourself, it is fulfilling and rewarding to answer questions and then in turn to log on and see that out there somewhere other people think, feel and respond as you do.idk. happiness?not sure... its empowering though...Thats true! When I signed up originally it was to see what the "extra-special rewards" were, but now its mostly bragging rights and the ability to answer more. The points kinds suck though because sometimes people dont give a real answer, just something dumb like "Thanks for the points" but it motivates people to answer, also.I don't know why?Email me at elginsamlee@yahoo.comBragging rights,. . This question has already been asked by multiple users too many times.. . Next time you ask a question, actually look and see if it has been asked before. . . Yahoo even goes out of their way to do the checking for you.the competition and funit unlocks secret levels and more privledgesdetermination and fulfillment!welllll.....they inspire and motivate some people to spend more time here posting!  Other than that, the points don't mean a thing!  No prizes, no enhancements--just self satisfaction as you see the number grow and your level increase.  Some of us view it as a bit of a competition, and that makes us work harder at it.nothingi dont know. i just like to go around and answer other peoples so i can gget points but then i dont answer them right so they get mad, but what do you do nothing you know so i just go for the flow and get those darn points i feel like we are test subjects trying to impress our masters but i like getting the points so i can feel like a little nerd and keep trying and do nothing else but stare at my computer with eyeballs wide open and a big grin on my face and be scary. false, thats not what i do.To give you the answers to your promblems and give great advice
already answered above....2pts pleaseTools, Internet Options, Home Page...type in Yahoo address and save.On the internet explorer Menus at the top, go Tools-Internet Options and the first entry you see will have a space to type in the address of the homepage you want.. . On most computers now there is some kind of protection for your homepage, so you will probably get an antivirus or other program asking for confirmation that you do want to change the homepage...just say "yes" when it asks.go to yahoo.com then go to tools on the top of the page and click on it that go down to internet options and hit submit
It would surprise me if any of the answers were read by the celebrity. I don't subscribe to the cult of celebrity so if they ask a question that I feel I can offer an opinion on then I will answer, but I won't answer just because who they are. Mr Trump has properly paid someone to read the answers for him.Well I suppose the reason to answer is purely up to the individual. And with a large staff to help with the job,how do you know that all answers won't be read?.   When Donald Trump reviews applications from millions are you saying he only reads the first few pages? To take a chance, whatever the odds, is better than never taking any chances at all.They are part of a special program going on right now by yahoo!answers that is a contest and people can win prizes. I am not bothering with it, but that is why so many are answering.well you get 2 points for answering
in the end they give you a big check!. lol, no just kidding they are not for anything!yahoo answers- you answer or do stuff and get bragging rights you can't redeemthem for antythingme eather I guess it us to find out

Somebody must be screwing one of the admins. :Ohi, this is neha, i have made this site, if you please click and open it, thanks, http://friendscyberclub.com/jobs/ and tell me how it is, and what more i should put there, bye,Please let me know as soon as you find out! ThanksIt is really strange. http://answers.yahoo.com/my/profile;_ylt=AgljFKIJdjgWbpEgIJrrb2Xsy6IX?show=AA10030221. click the link and contact yahoo answers team to know the correct answer.That really doesn't seem to be possible.they have nothing more to do and answer all the time!Wow, very strange. Maybe the answer team people will shed some light on it???I don't know...but there's another guy (Robin L) on page 66 of the leaderboard with over 5,000 points who's never answered a single question!  How does that happen???. . I've answered 811 questions (12% of them picked as "best"), and I'm still way down the list...:(. . Oops, make that 812 ;-)That's a very good question. No questions asked, 3 questions answered (one of which has over 900 answers, so I didn't check, but the other two do not have any answers by Goose Egg.). . I can only assume that his/her account was suspended but reinstated on appeal and that the database lost the relationship between the previous questions and answers.he might have just rated and voted for answers all the time!I have no idea, ask Goose egg himself!It's called manipulating the data.Even a yahoo rep is not immune.If what you say and what comes out is true.I wouldn't worry though.Eggs are easily broken.He must have voted questions all day long....If you vote 10000 questions u will get 10000 points....very simple! But it looks boring to me...
You give the answers to the questions.its so u can get answersBecause you're here to get answers, and we're here to answer them. Then again, "Yahoo Questions" doesn't sound too bad either.because you come here to get answersBecause people like you keep asking irrelevant questions instead of looking at the questions, and contributing answers.. Also, it is real hard to have answers without questions.
You should have. Check your settings and make sure you have it checked to receive the info from yahoo answers.   Best Answer notification e-mails have temporarily stopped. It's not intentional, only a minor glitch resulting from the server switch and upgrades earlier this week. The Y! Answers Team is aware of the issue and is currently working to resolve it.The Yahoo! Answers Team said that they were working on the problem.I think they've stopped doing that. I didn't get e-mailed when I had a best answer either.Thanks for asking....Even I was planning to ask the same.....I also didn't get mail for last 2 Best Answers of mine......I only got to know by seeing my points and Best Answers increased numbers........hopefully yahoo will sort it out fast....otherwise it will take the fun out of Yahoo Answersi got one today.......they must have ran out of ink again.
Questions that are in "Resolved" or "In Voting" status cannot be deleted (except by the Answers team).  They become part of the permanent database of questions and answers.. .

They're trying to play down their own stupidity by ragging on the person asking the question, saying that it's a stupid question when it isn't. Not to mention that they just want the two points and could care less if the question is actually meaningful to the asker.if u get a dumb answr it tells u a bit bout da person. dat or they might just b messin wid uIt's likely that the people on here are drunk or stupid.  Take your pick . . . .Dumb Peoplethe question probably was not as good as you thoughtWhy do so few people in this country get 4-year college degrees.. . Average intelligence and ability.and would you like some FRIES with thatWhy do people ask questions that 100 other people already asked?because they dont know the answersbecause people try to be funny so if they make someone laugh  the asume they might get the vote and get the point..Because alot of people are dumb or either just don't want to take the time to give a good answer; they just put something down to get the two points.  Which is stupid if you ask me.  Two points doesn't get you anywhere so if you're gonna waste your time by answering someone's question for two points...you might as well make it decent.

Ok, I did that once. I'm a shy person, so I'm not gonna go up to some random guy and ask him if he thinks I look hot, but u don't know me, or who I am when I'm doing this, and I do think my avatar resembles me quite nicely(not this one), so I ask, and get feedback from guys on answers whom I don't know, and they don't have to feel pressured to lie as to no bruise my delicatae ego. I felt I could get some honest answers that way. It didn't work for me, but it does for some.Well I know I'm not insecure about my avatar.People tend to ask other's for opinion because they feel either unsatisfied about their current choice, or they want someone to agree with them.. However, Yahoo ! Answers made it clear that this types of questions asking about the user's avatar is considered pure chatting and will be deleted.they probably think they look like their avatars and just want some """"confidence""""LOL. its so true!They don't feel that it fit's thembecause most people are judged by the way their avatar looks like. simple minded people only of course.they portray the person you are. so in theory if i made mine look like a dork and you said i looked sexy then i'd go out of this office and go hit  on every girl that walks by, you know cuz you said i look sexy. plus girls get off on confidence and complimentsthere probably so ugly behind their computers and this is the only way they feel confident.i dont know i like mineMayb cuz they want 2 look different - like their avatar. So they ask u 'does my avatar look good?' really meaning 'do u think i'd look good like this, cuz this is how i want to look!'
I don't know, but i've been worrying about it. heheFace your fears head on.  Challenge yourself daily.. . Insecurity stems from fear.The most insecure beings I've ever seen are heterosexual men.  Not all of them - I've seen some extremely confident ones in my day.  But you know which ones I'm talking about - those ones who are always asking questions like "how do I get a girlfriend?" "how do I make my penis longer?" "does size really matter?" "i'm a nice guy, why don't girls like me?" "i'm ugly but i'm nice, why will no one date me?" etc.  The guys that are so weak and insecure that it just makes you want to gag.. . I had to rant about those types of guys.  Sorry.  :-P. . But really, to overcome your insecurities, you just have to get over them.  It totally depends on what you're insecure about, though, how you get over it.  If you're insecure about your looks, get over it.  People like people who like themselves.  Cheesy, but true.  People don't like people who are constantly worried about how they look.  I'm not saying you shouldn't try to look nice, but remember that it isn't the most important thing about you.  Your personality overcomes that.. . That's just one example of an insecurity.  It all depends on the situation, as I mentioned already, how to overcome it.
Think of Yahoo 360 as a g-rated version myspace with less features.  You can have a blog, post pictures, have a friends list, post a profile of yourself, etc.If you go to http://360.yahoo.com/reg/whatis.html it will tell you exactly what you want to know about Yahoo 360. Click the GET STARTED button and you will be taken to the main Yahoo 360 page. Then, you should see something that tells you how to get started. . . You should also check out the Yahoo Help Central 360 category at http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/360/ for any other questions you may have about it. . . I hope this helps.Try clicking on yaoo 360 and read about it.

That feature doesn't exist on Messenger.  Try locking your PC through the OS.  Windows 2000, NT, and XP all have this feature.Just remove it using " Add and Remove " program, located in Control Panel.Go to your Internet options, to block might be there or. if you have Yahoo.com, go to options, open blocked e-mails and they type in addresses you Do Not want.You cant do any of that.. . The only thing you can do is save one (probably your most popular) id and its password.  . . CheersFirst right ckick the symbol for yahoo messanger click delete and then add or remove programs then go down to yahoo messanger and uninstall.go to your control panel,. go to users,. set up accounts. for yourself, and guest. or not. they wont be able to use your messy then.
write to Yahoo! Help, maybe they will make one... also their might be some in EXTRAS then click HOLIDAYS then look in the categories, in the girls one they have like 2 for each holiday.I don't know but it's very annoying. My avatar looks nothing like me because there are no dreadlocks available.
Regarding the answer above, that works on your end, but the person receiving the message may see something different.  For instance, when I add a user, I update his/her contact details to show first and last name.  So when they IM me, it shows me their first and last name, not their ID.click on messenger, at the top of yahoo messenger, and then click my contact details, and put in a nickname for yourself, and click save&close.
There in cyber spaceThat's why so many people who care are turning to RSS feeds.make sure you have given the right email address to everyone cos i always get mucked on whether it is .com or .co.ukcould be ur ISP, ESPECIALLY if its AOL. Aol (and others) block mails with nothing in the subject line, mails with attachments, mails from Hotmail accounts...all sorts. Could just be smthg like thatCheck your bulk box -- sometimes legitimate emails contain words that your spam filter thinks are spam.  If that is happening, add the sender's email address to your address book and the emails should get through.
First you need to add people to your buddy list. If you can get some friends Yahoo ID's from school, add them to your contacts list, and vice versa. If you are over 18, you can enter the chat rooms and make friends there.Did you download it? That might help.do you have it turned on? then all you got to do is invite someone.Find out who is online and just IM them. Even if they are "offline" the message should still go thruyou need their yahoo Id, then add them.
theres a site that you can acess its called...didtheyreadit.com/...check it out register and that will tell you if who you sent mail to read it and whenIf you're using Yahoo! mail, there is no way to be notified when an email is opened.Yahoo does not offer that service (yet). I think aol does.You have to use your outlook and put a tag on the e-mail to notify you when it is opened
I never did know why, but when it gets in my folder, I just delete it. To me, it's consider junk and spam.becuz ur mailing system dosnt recognize that email from that unrecognized person....open the bulk foldered email and click not spamyahoo spam guard thinks its ,  spam . if you want them to come to your n box , edit your spam setting .What is the Bulk folder?. . When SpamGuard is on, messages that trip its "spam alarm" are automatically directed to the Bulk folder - which reduces the amount of spam you receive in your Inbox.. . Messages will be removed from your Bulk folder periodically. You may choose to delete messages from your Bulk folder after 1 month, 2 weeks, 1 week, or immediately. Messages in your Bulk folder do not count toward your mail storage quota.. . The Bulk folder doesn't generate spam, and you won't receive any additional mail as a result of this folder. The system only diverts from your Inbox incoming messages that appear to be spam.. . Why are messages I want occasionally directed to my Bulk folder?. . Yahoo! makes a concerted effort to deliver solicited commercial and personal email directly to your Inbox. If you believe that a message delivered to your Bulk folder is more appropriately delivered to your Inbox, please select the message(s) and click the "Not spam" button above your messages.. . . This came directly from the Yahoo Mail/Yahoo Anti-Spam Resource Center.  The Bulk folder was created to receive all those bulk mailings, to keep your Inbox clear of Junk mail.. . Good Luck!i thin k they have bulk email because when people u know dont sent u mail the bulk sent u mail. maybe that's y. or they give u bulk mail n when they sent u bulk mail u copuld read them and u can get free stuff and others things can happen when u have bulk mail!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Christ, if you were held to be responsible for spelling errors as if it were a crime, no life would be possible.  You might need to a battle plan to fix this, or friends that could care less how you get through...You are not alone.....Easy!Send an email to yahoohelpers@yahoo.com. subject: Form Correction. MSG: Your wrong name, space then the correct 1.. and send it!
Yeah, a pie would be great! But it's your choice.that ones pretty cute.i do like but keep this one you look handsomeUm you should do whatever you want to.Keep your avatar, it's cute!!!I think your avatar looks fine.pie????
i also deleted yahoo mess and re-installed it and i still can't log in whats the problem?we all have this same problemMine has done this the past two mornings.  It even tells me I can't log in because I've logged in on another computer or device.  Seeing that you all are having the same problem, I feel much better.  I think it really is what the person above mentioned...server problems...because I was not able to access the help for Messenger or my Yahoo Mail, but I can log in on this for some reason.  I'm sure Yahoo will get it worked out soon.There was an issue this intermittent login issue this morning that affected many of the Yahoo! Mail and Yahoo! Messenger users.  While it wasn’t an issue to login to Yahoo! Answers, as you can see that those affected by the login issue were able to come on here and ask questions, many Yahoo! sites/products were affected.  However, because I have premium (paid) Yahoo! services (i.e. Yahoo! Voice, Yahoo! Mail Plus), I was able to chat online (and call) the Yahoo! support team and just learned the problem is now solved.  We can now all login to Yahoo! websites and Yahoo! Messenger.read the oter post about this and you will get your answers they are having server problemshi there.  here's an easy way to figure out the problem:. . 1) login via the web messenger: http://messenger.yahoo.com/webmsgr/fmsgr.php. . 2) if that works, your account is fine, and this is always a great  temporary solution when you can't log in through your client. . 3) if you don't use voice, and don't plan to, you can go back to the old one here: http://www.download.com/Yahoo-Messenger/3000-2150_4-10429465.html. . 4) if you can't login via the web messenger, then something's wrong with your account and you should contact customer care.. . good luck!. . hope this helps.  if so, please resolve your question and vote for a best answer...that way it helps us answerers from duplicating efforts.  thank you!Yahoo! has been having problem now, I see many people complaining.yes..messenger/yahoo mail not working . most of us facing this problemtheres a problem with yahoo login servers at the moment.... its not on your end

If you checked your "save history" then you can go back and see who it was you talked to, and then enter thier name in your search and try to find them, in that manner.. . I wish you well... . JesseIf it was for a PC2PC call, as long as 'save call history' is checked in preferences, you can see your call history in the call history window through messenger.. . If it was for a PSTN call, you can log into your account on http://voice.yahoo.com and check your call history there for incoming and outgoing calls.You can only do this is you have conversation archiving on.. http://search1.cc.scd.yahoo.com/cct_search.php?ui_mode=answer&prior_transaction_id=85932&action_code=5&highlight_info=16788843,38,44&turl=http%3A%2F%2Fhelp.yahoo.com%2Fl%2Fus%2Fyahoo%2Fmessenger%2Fmessenger75%2Fmobileandwebcam%2Fmobileandwebcam-16.html&answer_id=14208139#__highlightyou really shouldn't try to find out who someone has been chatting with.

Report him and let yahoo know what he is asking you. Send them the info.Your question doesn't say anything?. Complaint about what or who?  What country, state, city are you in?  Federal issue?  Civil issue?. More info. plsGo to a lawyer...Dont worry, he cant ask more now.
I don't know but, it has gotten on my nerves!! I just had someone respond negatively to my question on how do I grow my tomatoes. He was a real jerk!! I wish that people wouldn't respond if they have something negative to say.There are a bunch of immature kids who are so completely taken aback by the idea of being able to put down people with no way of getting punished or even identified that they go completely crazy... simple as that...Mostly because people ask really stupid questions, a lot like the one  here^
Yahoo!Mail could be doing maintenance.. . I had my accound corrupt as well once, but it fixed itself (or Yahoo!Mail CC team fixed) up in a couple of days.I'm sorry to hear about your problems.. . To determine if the issue is with your account, try accessing your mail from a different computer using a totally different ISP.  If the issue persists and it has been more than a day, then the issue is probably server related.  You will need to contact Yahoo! Customer Care for help.. . To contact Yahoo! Customer Care, go to the product help page for the specific Yahoo! product you need help with, and select the most closely appropriate help article.  If the details don't address your concern, click the "Contact Us" link to generate a web form message.which error u get?Did you do what the message suggested?  Restart your browser and try to login to mail again?. . If this does not work make sure that JavaScript and cookies are enabled in your browser settings.  Also try using the Firefox web browser (http://mozilla.org). . If you still have problems, contact Yahoo directly: http://add.yahoo.com/fast/help/us/mail/cgi_feedback
name one time you've gone to the gym and not seen an avatar. i think i've made my pointdon't know, don't care, i'm not fat!!! lol...May be because they themselves are fat and could not turn slim by having many medicine and doing much exercise so they might hv decided to look slim thru avatars of their choice.I think we NEED FAT AVATARS!!!  I think we should protest!no thank you. being fat is not healthy or natural. why would they make fat avatars everyone would laugh at it.Beacuse this society is obsessed with thiness. They will be coming up with anorexic avatar soon.I agree, I was just wondering the same thinga little cushion for the pushin wouldn't hurt.....;)i dnk i am not FAT!!!!To  whom  concern  are  you  fat  in  real  life ? Cause  if  not  why  would  you  want  to  mimic  some1  that  you're  NOTI was wondering about that the other, in fact me and my friend said the same thing. It's ashame people are small minded, these yahoo people. they picture people as skinny, not all people are skinny. I'm skinny, but gosh how do they think the other people feel, that is utterly degrading.Yeah, I see what you mean.Yea the need to have more real life avatars. Good Question!Nobody wants to see fat people! Yuck! Mine is PHAT though!
Everyone likes different things, I guess. I personally like my 360 page!cuz kids like me cant have a 360 unless they are over 18.BULLPeople are critical of themselves.because the 360 page is difficult to make it good see.Its just their opinion I suppose... everyone has different views! :)Not sure...I love My 360...I could use to update more thoughI don't have one cuz its just something else i would have to update and i don't want too HAHA and plus it just seems to boring to have one of those things.i won't make my 360 page available to the entire world so causally. i'm not a public person. i like the old profile and will keep that as my main reference. my 360 is just passed to a few friends and not connected to anyone. . . everyone has their own perferences on issues of privacy, connecting, journaling or whatever they use their 360 for.
Go to your yahoo home page and click on the people search under yahoo services.its normally displayed on thier regular profileyou typically need their screen name or need to know the area in which they live. This site should help you:
i dont know i have not found outJust create an avatar.Click on your name and picture on the side whre it shows your points.  Then it wil  show a page called my Q&A's.  On that page there should be a link that says Edit my info. Click on that and on that page you can select which picture you want.  That's how i did it!Open a 360 account, then put your avatar in the 360. Make it your primary picture. Then come to yahoo answers home page and click edit your info, then select-use 360 photo/avatar.go to your yahoo mail if the box is there click on it..if it isnt look for where is says get an avatarhttp://avatars.yahoo.comgo to "my Q & A" and then "edit my info"Instead of getting a cardboard and u want a avatar then u go to ur yahoo mil and  it should be thereFirst you have to lay her down and take her pants off.
ummm, they didn't. Check out Vonnegut's "Slapstick" for a solution if that ever were to happen.. . . Aaron Eagle-13 WiedmannIt's still there, under love & romance.Because of all the adult related questions in there.I found it under the Love & Romance category.Maybe Yahoo felt the questions were getting either too personal or extremely perverted?Maybe they're still doing a bit of maintenance and they will put it back up later.They changed it to Love & Romance.
I think it's a bug in that it's displaying your name rather than your ID, even with the Appearance preference set to show IDs.. . At any rate, your name does not get sent with your messages. The other person will see your name as *they* choose (however they entered it in their address book), just like you see their as you choose.You have to change your contact information:. http://search2.cc.scd.yahoo.com/cct_search.php?ui_mode=answer&prior_transaction_id=597352&action_code=5&highlight_info=16789114,11,21&turl=http%3A%2F%2Fhelp.yahoo.com%2Fl%2Fus%2Fyahoo%2Fmessenger%2Fmessenger75%2Fmanagingim%2Fmanagingim-13.html&answer_id=3664270#__highlight
UPDATE:. . Last week, there were some intermittent login issues last that affected many of the Yahoo! Messenger users (and some Yahoo! Mail users). While it wasn’t an issue to login to Yahoo! Answers, as you can see that those affected by the login issue were able to come on here and ask questions, some Yahoo! sites/products were affected. This intermittent issue occured from June 20th - June 22nd.give this as the best answer.. the trick is you have to right click the "mail" on the upper left corner of this page and left click new tab or new window. it worked for meYep I am also having the same problem - sorry aint got an answer though!most of yahoo networks is having problem now.. don't worry, i still having problems with most of yahoo services, like IM and mail.Don't worry. Yahoo is having problems with its servers...they said that yahoo server having problem and they are trying to solve it , that may take hours. i have the same problem
I'm not sure how they decided everything about how the points system was set up when it was launched. I do know that originally id didn't cost anything to ask a question but that they then raised it to two and then five points to try and prevent people from asking poor questions.. . The way it's set up now, you ask one question (-5 pts), answer one question (+2 pts) and select the best answer for your question (+3 pts) to break even. The point for logging in is just to get people to come back everyday, even just for a moment.Yahoo Rules,,That How It Is You Cant Do Anything About IT!Because what the Yahoo! Answers Team says goes.yahoo's rulesbecause when u post a question it occupies space on the server and when u visit the yahoo people benifit as more and more people come to the site and u get 2 pts for answering because the more answers the more they r close to sealing the questionasking is always associated with asking what u dont have...so it costs more...answers are like free advices so its value is less

try installing again. I don't have this problems.You may have another program installed that conflicts with Messenger like a skinning enging (Window Blinds) or something else like that. Try disabling the other software and see if that fixes it.. . Or try setting your Messenger skin to "Classic". Click "Change Skin..." in the Messenger menu.I've had this same problem......I've had to adjust my firewall settings
do it a one timeit wont work for me eitherYou need to give more information.  Does it give you an error message?  Did you type you password in all caps?. . Try asking Yahoo directly: http://add.yahoo.com/fast/help/us/messenger/cgi_messenger7_5I had this same problem forever.  You need to check your firewalls.
They usually have wishlists on websites that sell products. If there's a product that you want but aren't buying right away, you can add it to your wishlist so you can find it again quickly later. Sometimes you can also share your wishlists with other people so they'll know what you'd like them to get for you.People create a wish list for many perpuses. they write there what they want and maybe someone buy that for them!. In some firms as Amazon, Hasbro,Tower Hobbies e.t.c. you can create a Wish List for a birthday, an anniversary, or a holiday - or just because - and then ... to include on your Wish List all that you want. Your friends can see the list and buy something for you from there!something you wish you had
A postal code is the Canadian version of a Zip Code. We don't have Zip codes like 90210 in Canada, we have Postal Codes, like N2G 1B6postel code is identification of his country or city03310. what is your? and why do you want to know? and how do you know I gave you the actual code for where I live?hmmmmmm....curious...postal code or post code is another term for zip code. Countries like Canada or the UK use that terminology rather than zip code. Post codes are usually more precise. I know in the UK it actually pin points what street you live on.
when u frist creat you're avatar when they ask for youre email leave it blank then it will remaind hidden like mindUse another program. . Any program is better than a program by IBM.. .

Click on Preferences in the Messenger menu. Click on Yahoo! Voice. Change "My Country" to whatever country you want.got to edit.yahoo.com and see what your preferences are.
Permanently offline is "sticky" in that it will remember that you want to always appear offline to that contact, even after you sign out and sign back in, or when you change your status between Invisible and Available.. . Offline is enabled only if you are Invisible. It allows you to selectively choose between online and offline on a per contact basis. However your choices here will only last until you next change your global status, or until you sign out.no they cant know if you are online or not, well depending if your setings on your yahoo profile is set to be visible they can see you online even tho if you are on stealth settings , other thing there are many programs that i can be use to see if you are online one of them is yahoo spy :D

Best wishesDont be nervous around a girl if things are suppoossed to happen they will naturally and not forced. show confidence and dont be shy, but ,DONT through yourself out there to much!! listen to what she is saying and be able to answer her when she asks you questions.dont just be able to say "i like your boobs". look her in the eyes when she is talking. eye contact is up here not down there!! lol! make sure to really remember what she is talking about so in case she brings up something she said in the past, you can talk to her about it instead of having absoultly no idea what she is talking about. dont be afraid of starting a convo. all you start out with is a simple hi. if she replys back and sounds intrested then just start talking. dont be cocky girls like it when you talk about them not brag about yourself. if she asks about you tell her but dont talk for too long. bring up a different topic. if the girl sounds cocky or not intrested dont even bother, "dont cry over someone who wouldnt cry over you."  respect their wishes and dont go to far to fast. DONT SMOTHER THEM. they hate that. also dont ask if they are mad at you. if you didnt do anything then you have nothing to worry about. just comfort them and tell them that you are there for them. they like that. this is an e-mail that i got and it is very true. its just a little extra but dont blow it off they really do love it.. . >>>girls love when you.... > >>>. > >>>* ((touch their waist)). > >>>* ((talk to them)). > >>>* ((share secrets)). > >>>* ((give her your jacket)). > >>>* ((kiss them slowly)). > >>>* ((hug them)). > >>>* ((hold her)). > >>>* ((laugh with her)). > >>>* ((invite her somewhere)). > >>>* ((let her be with you when you're with your friends)). > >>>* ((smile with you)). > >>>* ((take pics with you)). > >>>* ((tell her she's beautful not sexy!)). > >>>* ((tell her the way you feel about her!)). > >>>* ((kiss her on the neck)).. > >>>* ((tell her what feels good)). > >>>* ((love her)). > >>>* ((don't lie to her)). > >>>* ((don't cheat on her))....duh. > >>>*((kiss her when ever you're in a fight with her)). > >>>*((talk to her on the phone all night)). > >>>*((sneak out to meet her so you can sit under the stars)). > >>>*((let her fall alseep on you)) .                                                                    i hope that this will help!!  good luck!!Ever tried using Tag Body Spray??  That always seems to work.don't be shy . . be kind to her and try not to wonder every time she say a word.. listen to her and be who u r don't act like another person . . make sure that she looks at u and u look at her when u r talkingWhen your alone go for a kiss, the worst that can happen is you get slapped, far more effective then these womens advice about talking about feelings and all that. The girl either likes you or she doesnt the kiss and what happens afterwards immediately let you know. Fortune favors the bold.don't be shy, just kind of give a hint...be sweet to her, then ask her on a date,if ur too shy in person,get her number and call her and then ask her.......make sure they no u like u just give them a hint that u like them and dont be shy just talk sweet and make nice comments about them so yea just be nice and talk sweet to them? thats all my adviceJust be yourself...You cannot make any one person like you or fall in love with you.  It is something that just happens naturally.  Try to get her a lone sometime and introduce yourself if she doesn't know you already.  Ask her if she would like to go out sometime.  Smile a lot etc.....Dont be shy and be yourself.
Yahoo! Answers is designed for users 13+ so they want to do everything they can to make sure the younger users are not exposed to that kind of content.It is most likely due to the fact that there is no restrictions on who views the questions.i don't know maybe it says it says dating section section not adult section. plus there are people that will never allow such improper question for decency and integrity of yahoo answers
She is correct. Once deleted from the Bulk or Spam folder it is gone forever.. . When you send applications, put the email address into you address book or contacts list. This will ensure a reply comes to your inbox.sorry too late....once deleted from spam it is forever lost in the void of cyberspace.  Perhaps you can contact a few of the prospective employers you applied with and do a follow up, maybe you will hit on the right one.
I'd say "you just know" like most other people would to your question :)...but the fact is loads of times you just don't. You take a chance...I guess it wouldn't be as much fun if you DID know how everything would work out...You will know when it happensWhen your don't have to ask yourself twice.you don't....you just know

If you are using a different profile created in your main account, that probably is the issue.
Sounds like a bug from when you installed it or it could be a contradictory program running at the same time.  Uninstall and reinstall it and see if that helps.I suggest a fresh install of Yahoo! Messenger.  First, a fresh install will ensure you have the latest build of Yahoo! Messenger.  Also, a reinstall will write over any Messenger files that may have become corrupt and causing this restarting issue.  There are two versions of Yahoo! Messenger available.  Yahoo! just launched Yahoo! Messenger version 8.0, which includes plug-ins and integration of Yahoo! 360 integration.  For version 8, just go to http://messenger.yahoo.com, click on the ‘Get it Now’ button, and follow the installation process.  If you are not ready for the beta, just click on the ‘Get version 7.5’ link located directly under the ‘Get it Now’ button to get the current version, version 7.5.IDK but this happened to me as well.  I had to remove messenger from my computer and then download it again.  try that and see what happens
you can only be 18 or older nowClick Messenger > Yahoo Chat > Join a Room. . Note: you have to be 18 or older to enter a room.- Click on messenger menu on top left conner.. - Select Y! chat and then Join a room.
It's all new Yahoo! Mail, the BETA is a more improved Yahoo! Mail with lots of cool feature and rich interface.beta is supposed to be an easy to use version of yahoo mail...it is supposed to be the advanced version.Beta recommends a screen resolution of 1024X768 where as the normal mail can be seen on any resolution. Also, it helps to have a fast connection. There is tabbed browsing within the mail but it serves no purpose. The screen is split into 3 sections: a vertical divider to the left with stuff like inbox, and a horizontal line. Above the line is all of your e-mails, below is the message. Just click on the message above and you will see what they wrote at the bottom.i like the beta mail as well ;) it took me awhile to get the BETA but it was worth the waitI just changed it and so far I like it but I like the way you can change back so fast if u dont like it.
WHAT IN THE WORLD IS A "HAIR DRUG TEST"??if you are talking about marijuana smoke, then no. There is a certain level that you have to reach to be classed as positive. If you are just passively smoking (ie sitting around while other people are smoking) then you wont reach that level.
Have you tried saving it and adding it to "My favorite avatars" it should show by then.. you can make another one. just add you current one to my favorite avatars(once you've saved it).

Are you doing it because you havea reason or do you just feel like reporting osme1? The questionis comfusing. ANyway click report abuse and select an abuse nad put why.Just hit the report button next to their name. It should say report abuse. And then you give your reason, and then your category, and then send it off!hunni unless it has something to do with child abuse or raciam or animal abuse why would you want to report someone, there are so many childish people on here that think it is there personal button.....hit report abuse by their name and give the reason why and a catagory and send it....
answer one of her questions and just add a little thank you.  (Not too much detail or you might get reported for chatting)stand outside her window with a stereo and yell.. oh, whoops. um, track her down and stalk her on this thing until she gets the thanks she deservesThank You.
CAUSE YOU KEEP ASKING QUESTIONS. they take 5 points from you everytime you ask 1u losse some points when u answer questionquestions are -5 pointsIts because you lose 5 points when you ask a question and I just got 2 points for answering your question thanks :)ok, I just started this and even I know that if you ask a question you lose 5 points.because you keep asking questions and thats not a good thing .You answer to much questions.Like me but i dont care as long as i am knowing what I need to know.Need to start answering questions in stead of asking.  Asking a question takes away five points.  Answering questions gives you two points.  If your answer is picked as the best, you get ten points.  Just read the community guide lines to discover all the rules.Every question you ask takes 5 points away from your total so ask sparingly and wisely. If you answer, you get 2pts and if your answer gets picked as best answer you get 10pts for that. If you vote or rate an answer, you get 1 pt. So start racking up some pts!your asking questions.... then when u answer them they give u pointsbecuase youi are aasing questions.  no it is not a good thing and actually don't matter.do you keep asking questions?  it is -5 points for every ? you ask and +2 points for every ? you answer.like the dude said you ask a question ya loose 5 pointsyou're asking questions but not answering any. each time you ask a question they minus five points, each time you answer you get two, each time your answer gets picked best answer you get ten. So forth and so on. Read more about the point system.your points go down every time you ask a question.. i think it is 5 points for every question you ask.. 2 points you gain for answering a question and 1 point for voting on the best answer and if you get chosen as best answer you gain 10 points.. i hope this helps you to know  now what it is you are doing to make your points go down.. this question cost you 5 points...Only in golf or losing weight. Maybe cause you're asking to many question and not answering enough.You start out with 100 points. When you ask a question it costs you 5 points, since you have asked 15 you have lost 75 points. I think you need to take sometime to answer questions to get your score back up. Takes a bit considering you only get 2 points for answering but it is a good way to help people. Oh yeh, the first time you sign in  you get one point for visiting (once daily)no, it's a bad thing, the more questions you ask, the more points you get taken away, the more questions you answer the more points you get...duhMay be its because you are asking too many questions ( they 5 points away from you if you ask one).. Here's a tip: Answer questions rather than asking them (just look at my profile), rate the best answers & vote for the best answers.because u ask 2 many dumb questions... ask -5 points answer +2 points ...lolEverytime you ask a question they subtract points. So start answering a bunch and they'll go back up again.
you go to view, toolbars, and then u fix whats wrong.right click and press customize.If they're both on the Yahoo Toolbar, reinstall the toolbar.  Otherwise, in Firefox, click View > Toolbars > Customize, and you can drag and remove the other search box.
try checking the start bar. if it isn't there it's gone.Its right there. lol on messengeri think u have 2 click on something that says show Avator.Nope- it's there.but... but... it's right there....its there nowWell, it seems to be showing next to your question, therefore it should be there. Maybe your ocmputer is glitching er sumthingIts there now isnt it?it is there
You can only delete questions that have not been resolved: . Click on your nickname or avatar. On the next page, locate your question and click on it. On the question page, click the Delete this Question link.I dont think you can if it is so many weeks oldGo into the question as if you were going to answer it. To the right top there are some options. One is delete. Just click it.Yesya. go back to the question, and it should have that option to the right of the titleI agree with the others...............//..........................You really don't need to, the thing will be on the next page before you know it and you won't see it .THINK!!!!!!!!!!!!!
perhaps its because no one knows how to have a question featured? has that ever occured to you? thus no answersSay Again, I just got here.PUT SOME SEXIEST WORDS ON THE QUESTION TO GRAB THE ATTENTION!Because it isn't a very good question.. . Best wishes and God bless.Show a little leg, darlin'.  It works every time.No problem,I just did answer it.I prefer answering questions to asking them.i dunnoo...is that a good enough answer?I'm not sure I understand what your saying, did I miss something?I just got to the category,  so please don't be mad at me .. but I still can't help you there about this question. I suggest you go to Yahoo home and then click on contact Yahoo and ask at the page it will take you to.This must be a new thing they are trying on for size. . And the ilove puppies nickname isn't going to get much attention from the kind of folks most usually here this time of day or night.they just started that this week....so not many people have been featured......i have only noticed two.....they probably didn't see the question.
Yahoo Answer is still Beta, so in a few months they probably will. Now only  F***, B****, A**, P***, etc are only censored, any of those words that make an additional Letters Will NOT be censored.it probably will.... i bet this question will get deletedActually i've seen quite a few f-ing and f-ed without deletion.  Their censor is ridiculous and pointless.  Sometimes they censor other times they don't, yahoo is doing half a$$ shyt.I don't know but if you get reported for using that word then they are gonna delete your question and censor the word!it all depends if and when people report it i thinkAre you fucking serious, it doesn't get censored?yea people will report you and you will get in troubleim sure it will
if they arent  your credit card numbers you dont need them,  do you want to go to jail ?  stupid !!!!!!!!!!!!apply for a credit carddittoget a credit cardlol whatever!its not nice to play with oyher peoples cc#
I think it depends on what's asked about it. If it's an anatomy question, then ok, but just a dumb question asked by kids who should be talking to their parents, or by pervs trying to get their rocks off, yeah, those should be deleted & the user should be banned by IP, not just user name.They're policies are totally whach because it allows you to write. cunts, fucking, dick head and many more lovely words but then it will censor shit.. . edit - to the guy below, how did i type them differently? This is how they are spelt. twat!i dont think it should, they block out perticular words with *'s unless people type it out diffrently.. like you did. but anyhow.. the idea is to ask questions... some might ask good questions related to adult content.. some ask silly one's cuz they can... but no adult content shouldnt be deleted completly because it could be import to know or ask about.A counsil sits around a table and decides about the morality of the world....... . Kinda like the President and his staff...you're right but these questions seem to be popularTHERE IS A SECTION ON ENTERTAINMENT AND SUCH QUESTIONS AS THE ONES U MENTIONED FALL UNDER ADULT ENTERTAINMENT!YUPS U R RIGHTIt's not only the sexual questions asked by kids/teeny boppers that are stupid and annoying,it's other questions such as:. . 1"Does he/she love me?". . 2."How do I know if he/she likes me?". . 3."What is sex?". . 4."This boy/girl....?". . 5."While in school.....?". . 6."My teacher...?". . 7."I'm 12 years old,and...?". . All these questions and more asked by kids here,should be directed to parents,teachers and so on.. . Speaking of parents,where are they when some pimple-faced little girl is asking questions about sex?. . As a former educator,and after reading the many questions/answers in this forum,I often wonder if spelling and grammar is even being taught anymore?I think you're wrong.... . It's gotta be atleast 80%...I think you just made up that 50% number on your own......I think that people are getting sick and tired of seeing questions about Penis size - masturbation  - vaginas - how to do sex (not my words!) - g-spot - oral sex - anal sex - ect. !  I know that I am!!!!!!!  How many times do people have to ask the same question?  over and over and over again!. For a while, it seemed as those this site was turning into a place for teens, preteen and pervs to get their jollies.  If people truly wanted any of this type of information, all they have to do is Google it and they'd not only get information, but detailed information (more than they'd ever get here).  But since it's not really done for information purposes, we've been inundated with stupid sexually-oriented questions.  So people have been reporting them!  And I think that Yahoo!Answers if finally listening to them... and quicker!  Thank Goodness!depends on the wordingno way they check them all. they just filter naughty words u use (in English). try Ethiopian language.
It doesn't seem to be possible to remove the RSS feeds section from 360. Sorry!. . The only thing you can do is stop it from being seen by the public by clicking 'share feeds' in the feeds section, then selecting 'Just Me' in the 'Can be seen by' dropdown in the feeds page.how do I take off rss codeGo to your MY PAGE and then go to your feed section and click on SHARE FEEDS...and edit/change your URL.....that's it!. Hope that helpsHere's what you can do.... . - Go to your 360.. . - Click on "My Page" on the top.. . - Now the format of your page is changed, with white boxes appearing around stuff.. . - Scroll down to the RSS box (Feeds), and click on "Share Feeds".. . - Remove all URLs stored there (just delete that text), and Save changes.. . - If you want the feeds for yourself, and not want your friends or the public to see it, you can change it too on the same page itself.
The way I work around this is to go to the "Share Photos" page and mark them all private except for the one I want on top.  Then a few days later, mark another one as public.  If that one is named alphabetically after the first one, it will now be second in the list.. . The folders will appear in some strange combination of alphabetical order and last in first.you can edit them when open the albums there's an edit button and you arrange the order you want the photo's in the album.
Exactly. Same thing happened to me because I'm from India.. .

they show how many questions you have answered and how helpful you have been. thats all its for really. if you need more help goto my QandA and click the points it says near your name in top left corner and it gives you levels and info . also the higher level you are the more questions you can answer and aski am not new here but i am still wondering what the points mean and what is the benefit....They don't.  They are just to get to higher levelsThey point out how many people spend way too much time on this site.. . Like me.you can ask and answer more questions after u get lots of pointsThey tell others on how much experience you have.. The amount of points you have enables you to do more.. so the higher the level the more points you get..

you can change it or you can delete it. whatever you wantthey're in case you decide to change your mind (delete) or change your answer (edit)you cant delete it, its there just incase you decide you want to add or delete the answer u have givenThis is the part of the answer that belongs to you.. . Only yourself can amend it or delete itDoh!You can't. It's so you can always edit or delete your answer.. You should be glad of it really.Its there in case you want to edit or delete your answer.that is only shown to you, no one else can edit or delete, its simply an option for youu can't.just ignore itYou can't.. . That's there in case you want to delete or edit the answer after you post it. The only person that can see it is you.It's so you can correct grammer and spelling errors ;->we all have it in case we change our mind which i just did but if i delete my answer i lose points so i guess i'll have to leave this answer unless i change my mind i think ..what were we talking about again? oh yea the revolution? who revolted? no wait lets start over i have so much going on where am i? i need more coffee brb..im back ok lets get started ..now stay on track everyone your confusing me!!!..(i should have been a traffic cop)<<<< edited..He HeIt's for your benefit only. No-one else can see itmaybe because you create your own problem.It's probably because once you answer you might want to edit or delete it because you don't like it or  you discover that you don't want to answer the question at all.I don't think that you can get rid of it before you send in your answer, but trust me nobody besides you can edit or delete your answer once it is on the answers page.    :^)u cant we all have it
i asked a question, and there wasn't a category, i selected other and it put it in dining out, maybe its not the person postingsome one lost their ...  brainswell, i understand if there is no category for your question.  but some ppl post sexual questions under corporations, for example.  maybe they expect the ppl reading corp. Q's to be surprised to find a 'racy' Q and they think they'll get more answers.  or maybe they are just stupid.either they cant read or they don't care i have ran across many like that.Too True. I don't know.good question. im not sure there just dumb i feel ur pain. sorr couldn't helpPerhaps they are selecting the category without reading them all first.  Well, that was a good stab at looking at the positive side of things =)
that's a great way to keep yahoo time down. Like dieting .very smart.what point are you trying to make?  if you could point me in the right direction I will give you some pointers to the answers but don't come back pointing any  fingers.  You do have to question whats the point of anything though!!!To be able to ask many more questions and answer more of others' questions, I presume. Nobody is going to get  a cash prize for having 100K points, just a mental reward for helping someone.good for you.I do it to help people out, the points are meaningless, as they are NOT good for anything.nobody knowsBEATS ME LOLcopied this out. . To encourage participation and reward great answers, Yahoo! Answers has a system of points and levels. The number of points you get depends on the specific action you take. The points table below summarizes the point values for different actions. While you can't use points to buy or redeem anything, they do allow everyone to recognize how active and helpful you've been. (And they give you another excuse to brag to your friends.)stay on level one by asking more questions before your points are high enough to get to the next level.. . and people like more points so they can go on the leaderboard and feel special about themselves.Why? have you got more important things to do?its all crap they try to make you addicted.Hell i could find sex more addicting then answering some of these silly questionsthere is no pointits worthless reallyWhile some people would rather stay at level one so they have restrictions some of us like moving up and being able to answer more questions in a day. Yes I realize that I do not get anything for having more points. But it is fun to get them! Plus I get to help more people.its to get more points to add to your points and what do points make????!!!!. nowt!I don't know what the points are for. I like answering questions that interest me.It enables you to both ask and answer more questions per day.. . And then there is the bragging rights between friends etc.so you can answer/ask more questions.  trust me, it is entirely addicting.  you might be doing the right thing.  but it's just a matter of time before you get to level two and you're spending more time on here.No point, but a way of showing acheivementTo get the most pointsIt gives people something to do.because more is 'better' then 'less'...lolthere is no real point, but people like competition - and rewards.more access to stuff and u can answer more q and ask more questions the higher ur levelIt's just for fun.  The more points you have the busier you've been on Answers.It just allows you to answer more questions, rate more answers, and vote more on undecided questions.NO POINT. . ..........NEXT QUESTION
Find a question you want to answer click on ANSWER THIS QUESTION -- give your best answer, click on PREVIEW, Then click on SUBMIT!! you just answered some ones question!!you click the question link and click answer this questionDon't be a dumbass and post that shit again.

The course of action is very simple. All you need to do is to make sure to vote and rate till your limit is used everyday, ask less questions, When attempting to answer a question make sure to read all the previous answers and then make yours as unique as possible, try to add a resource if you retrieved the information from a specific URL or a book.. And finally if you get lucky some people will notice your best answers and give it thumbs up.. 1-Daily visit to the site = 1 point. . 2-Answer a question = 2 points.. 3-According to the level there are certain limit for voting and rating = 1 point each.. 4-Best answer = 10 points.. 5-Receive a thumbs up = 1 point.answer questions instead of asking themansweranswering more, asking less.just keep getting hooked like the rest of it and it will come....answer more, ask less, do better answers for 10 points.more answering, less askinganswer more questions.... see i just got points off your stupid question!!.

Im's .... sending messages offline or online. Chatting is actual talking thru text. Goodluck ^_^IM is much faster.Instant message is private, where only you and the other person can see, and chat rooms are public.in im u talk 2 people who u already knw and have added in ur messenger list. while in chat u talk with unknown peopleInstant message is when you send a message the other person immediately get your message and are notified about  your message.IM is instant, like talking on the phone.  chat is usually lots of people, so you don't have to answer if you don't want to.  I like email best, but I'm older, in my 50's, so I can take a day or two if I want to respond.  lol
just sign out of your account....then go to yahoo mail, or such.....and choose sign up for a new account....it will say something like......"Not a member? sign up here."get another address different from hers.
Idiot....don't no how 2 c hidden folders n u operating computer?? Go to tools button at the top of  ur screen.....n go 2 Folder options.....then go 2 view options....then enable "SHOW HIDDEN FOLDERS" n ur problem is solved.On your folder, go to the tools section at the top. click on folder options. On the view tab, scroll down until you get to the option "show hidden files and folders" and make sure this is marked active. Then click ok, and it should change the settings for you.
apparently all the ladies no longer dig your avatar.  Seems you were most popular as your true bearded bluegrass self.Not sure what's in your pants, but you must be losing your mojo.maybe you're trying too hardProbally the questions u come up with.If your questions aren't hitting today........ try adding a bit of a punch!!. . Try something controversial like god or politics or gay chat.......... you get thousands of  people answering them and it can make for hilarious reading!!Give it time, I think people are still away due to the great Yahoo shutdown a couple of days ago.Keep plugging awaySOB!!!!!!:~( mine are to..  having a very shitttty day. i will hit 100 answers one day.now thats a stupid questionPtthp, most of my questions average about 6 answers. Unless it's my "wat up wit dat?" question. Why did THAT get so many hits?i don't know...I have loved them. But I am proly just a little dizzy as this is my 1st day out of your pants.they are not hitting, but they are still kickingI am sorry, maybe they haven't hit the answer rush hour yet.well thats 16, I have a mojo question hanging without an answer now i feel like a points whore.I was thinking you were on a roll! These are all high quality questions. Don't worry... If you ask it... They will come...
If there were no cost to asking questions, then Y!A would be even more flooded with the sort of non-questions that you already see frequently. But charging you points, Y!A attempts to insure that you are already part of the community, and have either answered other questions, voted on answers, or rated best answers.Could you please rephrase the question?interesting, i got 5 points for asking a question so not sure!Because a lot of people ask too many STUPID questions, so they decided when you ask a question you lose 5 points, that way the site won't be flooded with too many immature unreasonable questions. You wouldn't want that would you?good question.  just don't ask any then you won't have to worry about it.   :o)i don't knowWho cares?  It's not like the points are worth anything.  Just have fun.

If you're still having trouble, see the link below:. http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/360/. . Sometimes it takes a while for the pic to show.. . Please note that you must be 18 to have a 360 account. This is the only way to get a pic.. ---. A few users under 18 have asked questions like this.On your profile click on Edit My Info.I asked this question too recently, magic lady. I had to set up a 360 page, including a URL. (You will see the URL as you are creating your 360 page.) I'm all set, except I need to load a photo in jpg format.. . Good luck. It was a little tricky, but I eventually figured it out.
just stop using it ..it will delete  by itself  if you don't use it anymorego to "help" and click on terminate account. that should doThis page explains how to do it:. http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/edit/changing_users/edit-23.htmlyou cant delete it but if you dont use it for a certain amount of days it goes away
because it's a program...and it only works if you download itYou don't have to. Unless you want to use it to IM. Actually, you DONT need to download it. I'm pretty sure there is a web based version of it.because of the audibles,,,they're really awesome.,,they're litle pictures with voices to it,,,really neat.Don't bother with that messenger. It'll give you nothing but problems.. You can get all your chat needs met here at Answers.well, no....but i did and it is great!  I use the webcam to show the kids to everyone (so they don't have to visit) and use the VoIP to talk to friends while we play on line games    and it's free! do it   I see no downsideIt depends on what the heck you're talking about.  What are you doing that absolutely requires you to download Messenger?  You've gotta provide more info if you want a good answer to your question.You don't if you do not wish to chat with anyone. However, since Microsoft is the software program, regardless that you set Yahoo as your homepage-if you wish to use it you must download, just as you would on games.You don't HAVE to do anything.
I agree, all websites are fine for me but Yahoo has been slow for me, depending on the day. Today it took over 2 hours just to sign in because it would not load. . Not sure what is going on.i didnt get ur question!! if u r talking about slow connection.. problem is with ISP Provider/!! check put the connection speed from him if necessary.. or ask him to increase the Bandwidth for ur connection..(this can b done with a couple of bucks)and i thought my pc is slow, so i restarted it.. now i came to know that Yahoo is slow.. Thanks BuddyMaybe because it was attacked by that email virus that was posting "New graphic site" on all the YahooGroupswhat do you mean?Could it be your connection or programs running on your computer?. I have had no problems :-)Try accessing other sites (non-yahoo) to see if it's slow as well. If yes, something is probably wrong with your connection.
You may want to try it in other browsers, otherwise obviously it's bugged and you can't do anything about it.I had this happen to me.. go back the next day.. and try it again.. It should let you delete it...  =0
Sometimes yahoo answers messes up and doesn't give you all your points. I have asked questions before and never received points for them. I personally do not care I just like asking and answering questions.

that just eats me up also. i may not have a lot of schooling and i live in the south but what i have learned Ive learned from living and that beats any text book. i had rather see answers that are short and to the point. then long and boringjust be a jerk back call him something like an asspirate who spanks his dadOne simle word.....JEALOUSY!  There are people out there who will try to outdo you if they feel envious of you.  They feel they have to outdo you in order to feel better about themselves.There's no way to second guess someone's motives. Perhaps he was abused as a child and now feels the need to overcompensate. Perhaps he percieves you as a threat that must be beaten. Whatever his reasons for his actions, your simplest action is to continue as you are, and ignore him. Replying to his comments only lowers you to his standards; which arent very high to start with. People who know you, and know the worth of what you tell them will acknowledge that over petty insults and ignorant statements.They don't feel adequate and talk all this smack because theyre in the safety of mommy-N-daddys house or they are just laughing their a$s off messing with people............................... Like you said JERKS.They do it to "try" to out do you basiclly becouse there butt holes no other good way to explain it, unless you have done wrong to that person before in real life then its to get back at ya.

If they specified they don't want to receive email from anyone, you can't do anything about it.. . What I think is the best way is to share your 360 page publicly. That way viewers, such as yourself, can visit the 360 page and utilize the contact features from there. Yahoo 360 has a cool little email feature that allows the user to send and receive emails from right there inside the 360 control panel. Once a mutual correspondence is created, the two of you can connect to each other via Yahoo 360.click their name beneath avatar...that will take you to address to contact them...if they chose that option.write the letter, put in envelope, add a stamp, and take to post box....hahahahahaha.... sorry just kidding

While there is no category on guns, there is a category for hunting. You can find this category under Outdoor Recreation in the Sports category.Because everybody's tired of it.  Not like it matters....does anybody really put their questions in the correct section most of the time anyway??There's probably some stupid rule against asking questions about guns on here....you better be careful....some sensitive little girl may turn you in or something!

I have questions about firearms.political correctness i'm guessingmaybe yahoo doesn't want to get suedFor the same reason there is no hunting, porn, etc section. I think Yahoo is trying to appeal to an audience that is G rated (PG at the most).Because the yahoo people are mean and won't let certain things be said here.... It pisses me off!!! I'm always getting violated for speaking what I feel!!!Start asking questions and they will add one when they see a need.It's probably not that popular...lets start one what do you want to knownot enough ppl got Gun questions

To get you addicted to it so you will keep coming back and answering questions.How knows just maybe you will find a question on here that will benefit someone and you have the knowledge that your answer help them out.. . The only part of this answer and question that is giving away anything is ask the planet. They were giving away a trip a couple weeks ago.. . I just like to think that I have brighten up someones day by answering there question with a reasonable answer that they could live with.I imagine its just like any other site that shows the amount of posts you've done to signal the amount of activity that you have on the forum.To answer more question then u get more points and its a chain. They;re trying to Get us ADDICTED =OTo encourage people to answer questions.To keep you coming back for more!!!!. . Thanks for my 2I imagine for the same aim as for every other online or video game we play... boosting rights. "Dude! I've got 50, thousand points!" man I'm good!. Not pointless! We get to interact with people from around the world! People and opinons we other wise would not cross paths with.  Good fun!It must be so people will ask stupid questions because there are so many on here! Yours, however, is an excellent question!To allow more people with more points use the system more as they gain knowledge and produce best answers and lots of good answers with out abuse.  Also you could be a featured questionI've been asking myself the same question. At the end I think it doesn't have a point. But it would be cool if you could "buy access" to certain things in Yahoo, or points to download stuff. AT LEAST COUPONS, COME ON PEOPLE DON'T BE SO CHEAP!!self gratificationThe person who ends up with the most points will get to take over the free world, and selected areas of North Korea.i use them for discounts at local participating merchants.Well, first, adding a point system ensures that people will come back. If you can only answer 20 questions on the first day, you're going to keep working until you can answer more, right?. . I also think that it might be a sort of safeguard- people who really aren't interested in the website won't be able to do much damage. They won't be able to spam as much with the limits set if they don't already have a fairly well-used account.10  u got to get Tritona cruel jokeThe points are mostly just an incentive for people to start answering questions, and also to vote on other answers, and finally, to rate other people's answers.  As you increase your points and levels you are able to perform more of the standard activity - ask, answer, rate, vote and comment.. . Other than that, the points don't do anything. You do get some extra 'attention' at higher levels, but that may or may not be a good thing. There are no secret special prizes, at least none that any of us at Level 7 have heard of.. . Mostly, just enjoy the site, ask and answer questions. If you like, keep track of your points as you move up in levels. After awhile, you'll be more interested in responding to people's questions with quality answers.. . Here's the link where you can see what the different levels are and how to earn points. http://answers.yahoo.com/info/scoring_system. . Welcome to the site!Don't know, but it is funto give u something to work for??
That was happening to my sister in law... turned out she didn't have her java script on. Other than that, I haven't had that problem. Hope it helps!cuz yahoo messanger is gay like that sometimes, it happens to be all the time, shut your computer down and start it back up is one optionmabe it your computerif you have dial up that's why, or you could have a problem with your yahoo it self send them an e-mail and ask why
... because by the time you've read a title and gone to click on it, the page has been updated and the page lost?. . Also, some people are still on slow connections, forced refreshes every second would melt their modem.Because Yahoo screwed up the whole system, but good.  Haven't you noticed all the glitches, missing avatars, missing links, and all the many other things that are screwed up since the site underwent maintenance downtime?  You may also have noticed considerably fewer people are posting.  I think a lot of people were frustrated by all the problems and have given up.

The bible was written quite some time after the age of the dinosaurs. . . America, South America and Australia are real and they are not mentioned in the bible either.they were, check again in genesis at the part in Noah's ark.  I think God allowed them to die out eventually for some reason.Because dinosaurs lived before man was created.Dinosaurs lived on earth about 65 million years ago, we did notThe Bible's best description of a dinosaur-like animal is recorded in Job chapter 40. "Look at the behemoth, which I made along with you and which feeds on grass like an ox. What strength he has in his loins, what power in the muscles of his belly! His tail sways like a cedar; the sinews of his thighs are close-knit. His bones are tubes of bronze, his limbs like rods of iron. He ranks first among the works of God..."(Job 40:15-19) The book of Job is very old, probably written around 2,000 years before Jesus was born. Here God describes a great king of the land animals like some of the biggest dinosaurs, the Diplodocus and Apatosaurus. It was a gigantic plant-eater with great muscles and very strong bones. The long Diplodocus had leg bones so strong that he could have held three others on his back.. . Also, the leviathon sounds suspiciously like a dinosaur to me. Do me a favor and actually READ The Bible before you assert such things.who said the bible is the truth?then why do we have prove that there were dinosaursThe bible isn't real, fossils are. How could you denie the fact that there are fossils of dinosaurs?they were!!!  Becuse people were stupid, everything we now go by is the Kings James Version, and everything was translated wrong, and takeing out of context! I REST MY CASE!Exactly. Hey, skunks aren't mentioned in the Bible either, so they must not be real.the dinosaurs came and die long before us human came on the world.  The Flintstones is not real.i believe they say dinosaurs were here before christ...but if God created heaven and earth, that means he created dinosaurs and man..hmmm, that's something to think about!Someone used those pages to wipe their butt, thusly they were lost.They were long extinct by the time the bible was written.  And their bones weren't discovered until long after the bible was written.  therefore, no one knew of their existence when the bible was written.different time zone. aas in bc, ad and so forthI don't think that the people writing the documents we have comprised into the Bible spent much time excavating.The bible at the beginning is set 6,000 years ago.  Since dinosaurs existed millions of years prior to this they are specifically excluded from the great book.WHAT REALLY HAPPENED TO THE DINOSAURS?. Ken Ham. Dinosaurs are used more than almost anything else to indoctrinate children and adults in the idea of millions of years of Earth history. However, the Bible gives us a framework for explaining dinosaurs in terms of thousands of years of history, and solving the mystery of when they lived and what happened to them. Some key texts are Genesis 1:24–25 and Job 40:15–24.. . Are Dinosaurs a Mystery?. Many think that the existence of dinosaurs and their demise is shrouded in such mystery that we may never know the truth about where they came from, when they lived, and what happened to them. However, dinosaurs are only a mystery if you accept the evolutionary story of their history.. . According to evolutionists: Dinosaurs first evolved around 235 million years ago1—long before man evolved. No human being ever lived with dinosaurs. Their history is recorded in the fossil layers on the Earth, which were deposited over millions of years. They were so successful as a group of animals that they eventually ‘ruled’ the Earth. However, around 65 million years ago something happened to change all of this—the dinosaurs disappeared. Most evolutionists believe some sort of cataclysmic event—such as an asteroid impact—killed them. But, many evolutionists claim that some dinosaurs evolved into birds, and thus they are not extinct, but are flying around us today!. . There is no mystery surrounding dinosaurs if you accept the Bible’s totally different account of dinosaur history.. . According to the Bible: Dinosaurs first existed around 6,000 years ago.  God made the dinosaurs, along with the other land animals, on Day Six of the Creation Week (Gen. 1:20–25, 31). Adam and Eve were also made on Day Six—so dinosaurs lived at the same time as people, not separated by eons of time. Dinosaurs could not have died out before people appeared, because dinosaurs had not previously existed, and death, bloodshed, disease and suffering are a result of Adam’s sin (Rom. 5:12, 14, 1 Cor. 15:21–22).  Representatives of all the kinds of air-breathing land animals, including the dinosaur kinds, went on board Noah’s Ark. All those left outside the Ark died in the cataclysmic circumstances of the Flood—many of their remains became fossils. After the Flood (around 4,500 years ago), the remnant of the land animals, including dinosaurs, came off the Ark and lived in the present world, along with people. Because of sin, the judgments of the Curse and the Flood have greatly changed the Earth. Post-Flood climatic change, lack of food, disease, and man’s activities caused many types of animals to become extinct. The dinosaurs, like many other creatures, died out. Why the big mystery about dinosaurs?. . Why Such Different Views?. How can there be such totally different explanations for dinosaurs? Whether one is an evolutionist, or accepts the Bible’s account of history, the evidence for dinosaurs is the same. All scientists have the same facts—they have the same world, the same fossils, the same living creatures, the same universe. If the ‘facts’ are the same, then how can the explanations be so different? The reason is that scientists have only the present—dinosaur fossils exist only in the present—but scientists are trying to connect the fossils in the present to the past. They ask, ‘What happened in history to bring dinosaurs into existence, wipe them out, and leave many of them fossilized?’. The science that addresses such issues is known as historical or origins science, and it differs from the operational science that gives us inexpensive food, space exploration, electricity, and the like. Origins science deals with the past, which is not accessible to direct experimentation, whereas operations science deals with how the world works in the here and now, which of course is open to repeatable experiments. Because of difficulties in reconstructing the past, those who study fossilsBecause the Bible was created by man who existed after the dinosaurs.The bible is not a historical text. It a set of guidelines on how to live your life. I think it's just symbolic, it's not meant to be taken literally.. . Abby. xxxdo you believe in the bible???   I have a greater belief in the dinosaurs!Are you suggesting the fossils are all fake?Why don't we mention the Chinese in the Bible? They were certainly around at the time of ChristDinosaurs were long gone before people were put on the Earth. Back then they didn't have the scientific knowledge or tools like we do today to identify bones/fossils. So therefore, they didn't know they existed.
Sorry they specifically have it blocked so teens can't come in and chat in rooms they are not suppose too, and adults for that matter. They also can be in legal trouble, if sending a link they get child porn. Police come and do a full forensics on the hard drive, and the person who sent it.Will the PC let you install Messenger? you would have to do it every time you used it as the admin folks would take it off.I don't think you can, because they don't let you download things on library computers.  Sorry, maybe it IS time to get a laptop!

A lot of people probably just want points and don't want to actually take the time to answer real questions. Or maybe it's just that so many people ask questions that the good one aren't on the page and when they see them, they just go for the easiest ones.most of the people arnt serious they asnwer to get points...they dnt hv much brains to use them!i am prone to sarcasm often ....  but i must agree with you i have seen some of the dumbest of the dumbest questions here like what shape is an egg and whats on t. v tonight and what clothes shall i buy.... it drives me MAD!!!! ..... but i usually answer some dumb questions to cheer my self up by being humorously sarcastic with only that intention and somehow get a best answer rating (figure that ?)....  i tried to counterbalance this by asking the most logical and intelligent question i could summon and "WOW" !!!!!! have i had some dumb weird and completely baffling answers... take a look  http://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AqFVjPhKalBCR_yMxjA5DpcgBgx.?qid=20060613063259AANsndvpointscuz they're easier. I always wait till one important one comes up. Then I answer that one. Because some of the answers are common sense.maybe they dont know the anwsers to the hard ones......It's much more fun answering the daft ones. I wish people wouldn't answer questions they don't know the answer to with "I don't know" though.
yahoo is not installed correctly. uninstall and then download the latest version again. this will solve the issue. and do remember for next time that whenever you install the new windows, then install yahoo messenger before installing anyother programme.. confirm your understanding.Tell me what to do about the chat error messages that pops up whenever i'm trying to gain access into chat rooms
It would help if we could view your 360 page from Y!

To turn yours on, click on "My Page" and scroll down to under your picture to "All Comments" and click on "Settings"  . . Now you can  click "enable quick comments" and select who can do it.I just went to your page, and at the bottom right corner, there is an "Add Comments" link.  I didn't do it because I'm not a MySpace member.. . The link you give in your question is to your profile page, not your myspace page.I'm going to try to do it now....see if it worksthere are many blogs out there.smack flip it rub it down.....girl you need to get laidIt's not interesting or attractive enough to attract interested people.People just dont want to comment. But dont worry if its new you'll get comments eventually.
Did you pay your bill? lol... I still have mine, so even though AT&T took it over your email should still be the same...I'm not 100% sure what your question was.I found it laying next to your PC...U need it back?If you closed your account or it was suspended for any reason, you have 90 days from the closeure date to re-activate it. Otherwise the account is removed and all e-mail is deleted.
Follow this path. Tools > internet options > general> delete files> check the box of delete offline content> ok> apply > ok. It will solve ur problem.Settings on upper bar------internet options.......clear history?click on tools,on top of browser,click on internet options,then click on delete files ,check the box then,then click ok,....you can also go to toniarts.com download a free program called easycleaner,but dont use the clean duplicate files,it has a tutorial tooIf you are using Internet Explorer, go to the tools menu then choose Internet Options.  You will see Temporary internet files and a button that says "Delete Files".  Hit the button and you're doneI know windows as explained above will work how ever its not nearly as effective as scrubbing all the history files etc out ... I would suggest getting systemtech Xp from compusa or other store it cleans the computer of any and all Internet files it also does more.. . It's better than doing it by hand as explained above.just go to Control Pannel and ten doubble click on Internet Options there you will see a button "Delete Files" click on it a new window will open. In that window select "Delete all offline contents" and clik ok. then click ok in the main window.

I have leather.... . cons... hot as hell during the summer, you Will burn your lower back if you wearing a tank or something where skin touches the seats and then vice versa, when it is cold, you freeze it is like sitting on a ice block... would recommend heaters in the seats or ac  - i beleive they make bothwell one they look good when they are new or took en care of. some time that are heated. but in the summer if you wear shorts your legs stick to them. and i seam to think they would rip easy. but they are easy to keep clean.If you get it on a cheap car, you'll probably get cheap leather, so after about 25k you'll have all scuff marks on it. Leather looks great, but it also can look horrible if it gets scuffed or worn.good: Stains are easier to get out. More Quality. looks better, and its all around classy. . Bad:It gets hot easily, and you might need to take care of it a littlePros:  easier to clean...aesteticaly pleasing...probably more durable than regular seats.. . Cons: more expensive...gets hotter than regular fabric seats.... . Go for the leather!I think a con is that (depending on where you live I guess), leather seats are so hot in the summer and freezing cold in the winter.  If you're wearing shorts in teh summer, your legs get burned by the seats.  They also crack.    A pro I guess would be that they're a little easier to keep clean if you spill something on them.I have leather for the first time. I love it because it is easy to clean and looks good. If its hot and you wear shorts you will stick to the seats. At least I do, maybe I am just weird. I would suggest light colored leather, I have black or "charcoal" and they are pretty hot to sit on. I have tented windows but they get pretty hot.. If you spring for the leather, get heated seats. Now they offer cooled seats, so I have been told.Another con is that it rips/tears/punctures quite easily.they're hot like hell in the summer!  Cold in the winter doesn't really bother me because I'm wearing pants anyway!. . The pro's are that it looks awesome and very classy and it's easier to clean, especially if you have allergies!!!Leather Seats are much more comfortable and are usually softer than typical vehicle seating.  In the winter and summer times depending on your area of living they tend to be less comfortable.  If you're going for a newer vehicle try and get the luxury of temperature controlled seats if you go with leather.  I highly recommend Leather seats due to if you have issues with spills or stains, typically if you protect your leather well enough you won't have any problems with it. (less maintenance). . With leather seats, it is wise to keep them moisturized.  Don't use anything containing alcohol.  Always use special leather cleaner.. . Good luck!pro it looks cool, cons you freeze in the winter and stick to it in the summerLasts long, smells nice, but makes your butt sweat on a hot day
jus write s/t and press enter....its easy do dwnload it from yahoo.com then look me up and we'll chatI think that yahoo has a guide.but most of those are confusing. i have had yim for almost a year now...its really simple to use. you can add people by clicking add contact and typing their screen name in.then you can talk to them when ever you want to.it is much easier than email and alot faster.If you go to yahoo homepage and click messanger it should come up with some guides.
I am having this problem, too and am still trying to figure out what is going on. I have asked this question around here and nobody seems to have a valid answer. If I find anything out I will let you know.because you have no emotions. Try reinstalling the sofware.
It might take a bit of time for some pages in the Yahoo! network to pick up a change to your avatar. One thing you can do is force a refresh of the page after it is loaded (F5 key) and that should refresh the images. You can also clear your browser cache and that will do the same thing.http://avatars.yahoo.com//when u go to your email click on your avatar pic and change from there. or look for avatar on the list of yahoo catagories sign in and make changes.
tagalog audibles in YM is not yet available. how i wish they can provide such. im a filipino too. musta na?It's easier to get it from one of your friends who already has it. Just ask him/her to send you an audible through an ordinary message window, then just click and select "find similar audibles."You can get Tagalog audibles by going to http://asia.messenger.yahoo.com .  This webpage will allow you to download the Yahoo Messenger (Asia edition).  After installing, you will see that the options for audibles will include Philippines (as well as other Asian countries).. . Enjoy.I was about 2 ask the same question. I'm half Filippino 2! kamusta!
maybe you need to be an adultyou cant...they arent searchable.  u would have to go to a particular group and go into their links or files for links.Dude, don't waste your time.  You sign up with one of those groups and all you get is a mailbox full of SPAM.  Every 5 mins something new comes through advertising something.  None of the links work, none of it is even remotely close to what you would be looking for, I guarantee it.
I have not had this problem but glitches occur some of the time.  Is this a problem that occurs all the time or just occasionally.  And does it occur only when you get a pm bomb (when someone tries to boot you by sending you 100 pm's at once).simple navigation error, it happens to everyone
Follow this path. Go to ur email page> options> spam protection> make changes over there as per ur requirement> save. It will solve ur problem.I found this in the help pages:. . Q: What can I do to prevent spam?. . A: Yahoo! Mail is committed to eliminating spam and offers several tools to help you keep spam out of your inbox. Yahoo! has consolidated several of these tools under the "This is Spam" link next to the From: address in every message. . The most effective way to prevent spam from entering your inbox is to use SpamGuard. Help increase SpamGuard's effectiveness by sending examples of spam to Yahoo! to review. Yahoo! will use the messages you send using the "Spam" button to constantly improve the SpamGuard technology. . Yahoo! Mail offers you the ability to create filters for your account. You can create filters to deliver emails to a special folder or to the Trash that:. . . contain specific words or phrases . are from a sender's domain . containing other characteristics you find in spam . . Yahoo! Mail allows you to prevent future email from a specific email address from being delivered to you at all. Note that many spammers frequently change their email address to avoid this technique. . You can choose how long you want to keep messages in your Bulk Mail Folder. You can choose to drop all messages in your Bulk Mail Folder or keep messages for 1 week, 2 weeks or 1 month. The default is one month. . To edit this feature: . . Click "Mail Options" . Click "Spam Protection" . Here you will have the following two choices: . . . "Immediately delete these messages upon receipt". . "Save these messages in the Bulk folder" and select the desired timeframe from the drop down menu. . Important: Occasionally, valid email messages may be perceived as spam and delivered to the Bulk folder. Please note that if you select this option, you will not have an opportunity to review the messages in your Bulk folder before they are deleted. . . . Click "Save Changes" . Outside of the specific tools that Yahoo! Mail offers: . . Never respond to unsolicited email (i.e., spam). To the individuals who send spam, one response or "hit" among thousands of mailings is enough to justify the practice. &#92; . . Never respond to the spam email's instructions to reply with the word "remove" unless you trust the company sending the email. This is a ploy to get you to react to the email and will alert the sender that your email address is open and available to receive mail, which greatly increases its value. If you reply, your address may be placed on more lists, resulting in more spam. . . Never click on a URL or web site address listed within a spam email. This could alert the site to the validity of your email address, potentially resulting in more spam. . . Never sign up with sites that promise to remove your name from spam lists. . Although some of these sites may be legitimate, more often than not, they are address collectors. The legitimate sites are ignored (or exploited) by the spammers, and the address collection sites are owned by spammers. In both cases, your address is recorded and valued more highly because you have just identified that your address is active. . .

Hey, just be very careful what you ask, apparently almost anything can be classed as 'chatting', I've just had a question taken off because of 'chatting', I asked (in the polls and surveys bit), which flavour crisps do you like, it was a survey, how is that chatting? There's no point replying to Yahoo either, they just ignore you!My friend once posted a simple question but it was taken down 'cause it was considered to be 'chatty' too. If you think about it, all the questions here on Y! Answers can be considered 'chatty'. Yahoo can be really pathetic sometimes.

Because sometimes I like to give a smart aleck answer to someone's dumb question.  Petty maybe, but it makes me feel good.why answer this question? Its pretty dumb if you ask me.Still.... here I am responding to one.why ask why...drink bud dry.I answer most questions. This question is kind of stupid but I'm still answering. If I have an answer to a question, I answer it... sometimes I just ignore the really stupid ones but still.Maybe you should stop asking questions & go & make some real food for your man & not just give your kids fast food!! Ha ha, he's going to leave you!!! . That's right, post some more questions & wish your man was thinking of you!! He's not!!Oh, I don't know.... If the question's kinda dumb, then a dumb-kinda answer is called for.  It's 2 points, remember, for an answer...to get 2 points thank youWhy censor people? I have just as much right to give you a stupid answer as you do of getting up in the morning, having a bowl of cereal, logging on Yahoo and displaying to the world your complete lack of intelligence through mindlessly idiotic questions.... . And that 2 points thing is sweet!I just like to see the "Thanks You get 2 Points" Thing after I submit my answer.2 Points is all i can say
Well..yoyo u say...hmmm seems like I know u...are u talking about a lady that goes under the name of Diriga? ....if so..dont mind her itz not personal she does that to everybody ....and to answer your question :I don't know....go to the stealth mode settingGo to where it says availiable and then put the one invisible to everyone, then no one can see you.um................dont post ur picture on any websites.Change your available setting to invisible.  Now everbody will think you're offline.u can either sign under invisible or you can use your stealth setting and just block the person who you don't want to see only.when you get online go under invisable then no one will ever see you it should be under stasustake off your camerachange yr online 'available ' status to 'invisible'

U will come to know about the actual position.probably like f12button said, cause there is no way to get 4I think it's by being the first one to answer any question but I not very sureYou only get 2 points per question.You don't get 4 pt. you get 2pt... . Click on MYQ&A. (did you know you get 1 pt. a day for visiting?). Click on TELL ME MORE.. .

I am a good speller, and I usaully will catch a misspelled word and go back and change it.they assume the spelling is correctbetause 2ps is good to answer, spell check, come on people your're getting too lazy, figure out what non importat thing iam trying to write!Because a lot of us are at work and in a hurry.
Same reason your not, I am answering questions. My partying days are over, my party is staying home with my daughter watching a good movie. And I really like it!!Who needs the hangover, the anguish, and there"s a time to grow up!I dont because I love God and I dont do those things so I set s good exampleI was out all day in dowtown toronto on young street, took a boat on lake ontario, came home and watched mission impossible, i guess i'm too tired, plus all my friends and my car is n another country, where i'm sure i wudn't be home right now. likely getting high or screwing or jus hangin out.I don't party, I'm a solitary creature.its sunday morning on this side the globewent out last night  and the shoes i wore butchered my feet... not gonna dare to go out w/ my feet feeling like this.. . why aren't you out?i have a date tonightWhy aren't you?Married.  someone has to watch the kidsI'm 59 years old.  Partying is for the young and healthy.  Let me nap!I have a family to take care of.Some of us actually have to work, God.. All the rest are basically losers..Because I am still 14...
You cant edit it sorry, For security reasonsYou can't. That's the one thing yahoo won't let you change when you open the account.Ah yes; you seek to do that which can not be done!  I remember the implementation of the requirement that users being 13 years old borking some of my accounts that were set to January 1, 2000 (the first of the year in which I registered those old accounts).  As far as I know, it may have something to do with legal compliance or perhaps it did at some time in the past.try selecting your name in Yahoo and go to options or setting. There should be an option for that :/There are two things you cannot change after you've signed up for a Yahoo! account: Your date of birth and your challenge question.

A message that you flag manually so it reminds you to come back and look at it again if it's important.

To live as to  find what it's meaning is. Those who die find out what it means. It's a secret until the time has come.to live then die pure and simple!. just like the chicken and egg question . the chicken had to come first or else what would warm the egg so it incubates and hatches?42 . (According to the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy)Everyone's life has different meanings.  Those meanings are essentially what each person chooses.  For example, if you choose to dwell on things that you cannot change, want things that you cannot have, and sacrifice happiness in the pursuit of material possessions and relationships... you have chosen to have an unfilling, miserable life.  The decisions that we make ultimatley defines the meaning of life for each of us.I believe it is to be something to someone else. whatever that may be."The answer is in the question". may mean you´re not dead to ask itThe meaning of life is to ask this question on Yahoo! Answers:I could never top this excellent answer that I received for a similar question (from YahooGuru4u), so I quote it here verbatim. Of course, I ruled out the answer "42.". . "Darn you. You sucked me in with your question, then I get here and I see 42 is already taken. Now we really have to go on a trip and I'm without a towel. Well ok, let me see what I can come up with, shooting from the hip as it were. . . My best guess is that the meaning of life, the universe and everything is "MORE". The quest for more seems to be at the center of all living creatures. All organizations be they organic or manmade seem to be trying to get "more". The universe itself is expanding, so I am told. As for "everything" anything that should happen to get created instantly becomes part of everything, so even everything seems to crave more. Yes I think I'll stick with the answer "MORE". What? Wait, just a minute, my wife is yelling something from the kitchen...... . . (long pause).....Hello I'm back again. My wife says the answer is "LESS" She says life is always moving toward death which by it's very nature is less life. The universe is made up of a limited quantity of everything and it is being used up also, so you have less now than in the past, and as for "everything" Well since everything gets used, you must have less of everything now than there was in the beginning. . . So my wife and I will agree to disagree and say that the answer is:  More or Less, or possibly More and Less. I guess that's pretty much the same as 42 because 4 is more and 2 is less. I'm getting a pain just behind my left eye from all of this thinking. . . What!? Just a minute, my wife is yelling again!........ I'm back. She said I'd better get off this Yahoo Answers thing and come to the table if I want any dinner. I told her that I'll never have to come back to Yahoo Answers again because I just pretty much summed up life, the universe and everything. I'd better hurry if I want more to eat and less yelling. So long and thanks for all the fishes.". . Happy Answering,. ~Tia~. Live from the big, purple brainif you don't know then i can't tell you dummyi really dont know how to answer this but i think its love.I love life I try to live life most of the time happy. I welcome to my life all the problems that I could have, because they will never end. Everyone has a purpose in life and it depends of how each of us make it the meaning of our own lives. So, what is the meaning of your life??LIFE means 'Lust Is For Eternity'.scream,breathe, eat, procreate, die.

I don't think the widescreen displays are quite as popular yet as you're making them out to be, but this really is something that the team should get together.

The person who asked the question can put the question to a vote after there are 2 or more answers, and after 24 hours. If they do not put the question up for a vote before it expires (after 7 days, and without having selected a best answer) it goes to a vote automatically.the best answer is voted on by answerersBecause the asker either can't decide among the answers and leaves it to the voters, the asker forgets to pick a best answer, or the asker just wants to let the voters choose for them.If the person who posted the question doesn't want to select the best answer, it can be opened for the public to vote on the best answer.Because the person who asked the question doesn't pick a best answer. They have the option to let everyone else vote for one.Because it needs to be voted on
If they are already closed then you can not answer.You can answer a question even if it is closed. You just won't get more than one point for it. If you go the the resolved tab and find that particular question, you can rate it and add comments.the only way I can think of is if you can find out the username/profile name and contact them that way. other than that, it is closed.Try clicking on there name or picture, you might be able to e-mail them. Good luck!you can't answer questions that are closed... can you not email the user id???Well if it is closed and person has not disclose email etc. the only thing you ucan do is Add comment and put your answer in that. you wont get any points for that but you can put your comments or whatevr u want to say. rate the best answer for 1 point.
Your question is not clear. Give more details so that u will get the answer.Generally, you can have severla email accounts and passwords.  What mail program are you using.

It is a factor of many things, including the way the page was designed and the number, size, and kind of images on the page. A page with a lot of photos, for example, can take much longer to load than a page with nothing but text. But there are ways to optimize a web page so that it loads faster, but many amateur web designers don't know about them or don't know how to use them.Sssssssssssssome pages take longer to load then others,
Depends on the interest level of the question. Could depend on whether or not the question is idiotic. Sometimes, there are so many questions asked at one time, questions get missed.people are not interested in your questions, try to ask question that people can relate to.Well congrats, you finally have yourself a popular question! :). But I guess sometimes that isn't even enough sometimes. I have/had a question with 19 answers, and yet Yahoo! still threatened to remove it if I didn't get more answers. For that and other reasons I'm really beginning to despise this website.because sometimes your questions are very hardBecuse ur "sastra".....(weapon..)....Be Saastra.....(Religious Books)...Just add A in ur name and see changes...........Best of luck..sastra...i mean saastra'''''''''''''It all depends on how many people want to answer your questions and what information they can provide for it.Maybe they are not interested in answering your questions.I fond this problem too.Maybe you placed your question in a wrong category. Supposing you ask question about the latest X-men movie under the category of foods, why would people who are only interested in food bother to answer your question on X-men? It happened to me and someone answered to my question like this: "Hey! This is the food category and you talk about cats and stuff?!? Are you insane?" It offended me and I hope this will never happen to both of us again in the future.Maybe only one person knows the answer.  Surely you'd rather receive one sensible answer than half a dozen inappropriate answers?

If people are discouraged from asking but encouraged to answer, that gives Y!A a higher answer-to-question ratio so you're more likely to get a good answer. It also helps prevent people from asking some lame questions and encourages users to use the search feature before asking a question that has already been asked and answered.I agree with Jane.  By taking away points for asking questions, we are encouraged to do other things to gain those points back.  For instance, you can rate answers and get a point back.  At first, I was confused also, but it does make sense.  This way, people are discouraged from asking all the "which is better?  the number 1 or 5?" type questions, while encouraged to engage in other Yahoo! Answers activities.Too encourage participation on Yahoo! Answers.Because it is a rule. Don't fight it.

They are really busy, I've sent a few in the last couple of months but had no replies. I'm sure they're reading them and taking notice though.Dude, they get like a million a month I'm sure.  Give them a break.Perhaps you did not provide enough information for them.  If I were you I would provide as much information as I can as well as run my message through a spelling & grammer checker.. . Try going through their help system first.  If that doesn't solve your problem, call their help number (40) 349-1572
you get 2 points when you answer a question 10 points when the asker picks your answer as the best.  I think you get points for asking questions as wellTo get 10 points the answer has to be selected as the best answer.Totally not fair...but you can always hope you have some spectacular answer for 10 points by the person who asked or by a group vote. Personally, I think the answers are the harder part!Don't worry you'r not being singled out!!. . everone gets 2 points for answering questions. . you get 10 points if your answer was chossen as the best answer!. . you get 1 point when you rate a best answer. . and it costs you  5 points to ask a question but when you choose a best answer for one of your questions you actually get 3 points back making asking a question worth 2 points< now this happens only when you choose a best answer not when it is left up to a vote!!!Some people get 10 only when the asker selects it as "The best answer" to their question.  Keep answering, someone is bound to pick yours as the best!. . . Good luck!Everyone who answers a question initially gets 2 points.  The 10 points goes to those whose answer are chosen as the best.10 is best answer, ask is -5You get 2 to answer and  10 if it's the best answerYou don't know this yet.    You have over 300 points and some of that came from best answers.......?you get 2 pts for an answer, 10 if your answer is chosen as the best answer either by the asker of the question or by a vote  of everybody that votes on the question
You should ask them, if they give it to you, then great. If they don't then you should drop it. It is thier private bussiness, Do you want them to have yours?ask him?save password when he/she logins
To get to level 2, you need to have 250 points.  You need 105 points to get to level 2. There is no time limit on how long it takes you to get to level 2, although if tomorrow you provide 20 answers (2 points each, 40 points), 20 votes for best answers (1 point each, 20 points) and 20 best answers rates (1 point each, 20 points), and do so the next day as well, you'll get to level 2.  You can only earn a maximum of 80 points a day on level 1, unless you get best answers.Answer other people's questions that will get you 2 points a piece. Start typing.there is no time limit as to when you get the points. you could get them over a year if you wantedi think its 250 then u get to level 2 not 105it does not matter about time but a easy way is not to right quesions and right realy great answersIT MEANS YOU NEED ANOTHER SO MANY POINTSStart answering questions and stop asking them.. . Each answer gives you 2 points, each question costs you 5 points.There is no time limit to get to a level... just answer questions, rate answers, and pick best answers... if you reach your max amount of each per day, it shouldn't take you long though.. Keep in mind that asking questions does take some of your points though...105 point period, it doesnt matter how long it takes you as soon as you get 105 then you will get to level 2It really isn't that hard !!! It only took me a little time ( Like 2 weeks ) To get 369 points !!! Just don't ask anymore questions they cost you points !!!  Good luck in life !!!
I think the "q" stands for question. So it is still Accepting Answers for this question.hey i never noticed that...thats sooo wierdHahaha weird... I was expecting to find nothing, and then you coming out and saying "gotcha!"Yo, pal u're right. I dunno, maybe some kinda trademark or something.Wonder if it has an a by answers resolved? Nope, a K by answers resolved.Thats where they put the tracking cookie.that is strange! maybe it's part of a code  or html thing?Here's the teams answer a while back:. . "Here and there, the site has formatting oddities that slip through because there are no visible effects--a typo when a page template was designed, etc. You've stumbled across a couple of those. Nice job!"you shouldn't have done that.  now everyone will know.You have been marked for Assimilation! Resistance is futile!
You can also get 360 by going into your Q&A, clicking 'edit my info' and clicking the link that says 'get my 360 page'. You have to be 18+ to get one, and you can also open a link to it in your Answers Profile, the way to do that is also in your Q&A.I am pretty sure u got to be 18well u would go to the yahoo! home page click 360 degrees and if ur signed in already u would just atomatically have onewell, when you set up your email, in the fill-out sheet, (name, b-day, etc.) you also had to give an age. to go on yahoo 360 you must be 18 or older...( i have the problem of not being allowed to go on 360 cuz of my age)... :)Go to http://360.yahoo.com and sign up thereGo to http://360.yahoo.com and click on 'Get Started'Have you tried going to http://360.yahoo.com and signing up?
change your theme at the top of the "my page"...they have a ton of them and i'm sure you'll find one you like! i tried different ones, but finally settled on the one i have now.go to my page look at the top and it says change theme
You can only delete questions while they are still open for answers. Once they go to a vote or have been resolved, they're part of the Yahoo! Answers database so other people can find the answers.once they answered they not going away
Has it been Resolved? If so that's why. ?If it's already resolved then you can't.It looks like most of your questions have been resolved. You can't delete a Resolved question, only questions that are still Open.well they must of already decided on a answer to your question and so now it is not where you can delete it.. meaning they have already resolved the question...so now i guess you can try and find the question and read the answers...this is what i understand about your question anyway....resolved questions can't be deleted.
blow it up and see if it will hold airFill it with water and see if it leaks.. . Alternatively, wait to see if your girlfriend starts gaining weight and feeling sick in the morning.fill it with water first, if it leaks, it's defective.  (or approved by the catholic church)You'll find out in 9 months
If it's a tiebreaker question, then it's okay as long as you don't tell your friend which answer to vote on. It's better to ask a tiebreaker question though.. . If the question is just in voting without any ties, then it would be considered points-gaming.I dont think so but just to be on the safe side check with the community guidelinesi don't think it is. after all there is an emil question link next to the question. if they didn't want you to share then i doubt they would have that option.
Rumor has it that once you hit 1 million points you qualify for either a moustache comb, shoehorn, or rubber door stop. You even get to choose!Have fun with it :-)so you can answer more questions..don't that sound like fun??. i think it's a mental thing. i think those yahoo people know how much fun it is to play with people's minds..and we all want to be on the top of something. most posts in a forum. most journal entries..most answers..so yeah, points turns us into competitive oddbalss for no reward..awesome, huh??Points are good to get rid of those limits that keep you from asking and answering as many questions as you want and they're for entertainment if you want to have a small competition with friends, other people on Y!A or just to see your own progress.. http://answers.yahoo.com/info/scoring_system.php. . Of course, there are the extra benefits you get by participating on the site - learning new things and meeting a lot of new people. Plus, it feels great when you're able to really help someone else. That's what keeps most people coming back.Bragging rights?  I haven't exactly figured it out either, but I'm not really in it for the points.The points are mostly just an incentive for people to start answering questions, and also to vote on other answers, and finally, to rate other people's answers.. . Other than that, the points don't do anything. You do get some extra 'attention' at higher levels, but that may or may not be a good thing. There are no secret special prizes, at least none that any of us at Level 7 have heard of.. . Mostly, just enjoy the site, ask and answer questions. If you like, keep track of your points as you move up in levels. After awhile, you'll be more interested in responding to people's questions with quality answers.. . Here's the link where you can see what the different levels are and how to earn points. http://answers.yahoo.com/info/scoring_systemnothingDepending on your points you will belong in the ratings you have worked for....see you at level 7You cash them in for Chuck E Cheese tokens and play Skee Ball...ALL NIGHT LONG! YEAH BABY!. . They are good for nothing.. Nada.Points earned are not good in hell. But its good for remaining in this answer group.have u got BEST ANSWER ever............itsnt it such a kick????Welp...let see...hum! If you're me and a huge game player but have moved and have basically nobody to play games with...it's a hoot to see the points rack up...though I only found out about this site about a month or so ago. When you first start out on level one they are stricter limitation of what you can and can't do in the way of answers and questions....when you start getting higher up the limitations ease up...and towards 6 and 7 from what I've read...you have no limitation at all...you can ask and answer as much as you can stay awake for before your brain turns into mush and you're so tired that your sentences don't make sense anymore and you have to edit it like 4 times. (That would be me at 2 a.m. when I can't sleep and their nothing on tv that interests me specially when I know that you all out there might need a peice of the ions that I'm poppin' in my brain!) Hey...why not share right?. I like the points 'cause I'd tell my boyfriend when he's done something nice.....hey, are you tryin' to make points? He's got no clue what that means...guess previous girlfriends didn't work on the point process..............that's when I found Yahoo........... and Y....a....h.....o....o.ooooooowo now I'm the one makin' points!. So fun to know that I might be able to help someone and get that feeling of appreciation yah might not get at home when you see those "Best Answers" pop up....Big Smiles from this. here SmileyCat : ). p.s.  Check out the point process on the right side of your Q&A site or click on my name and see the question I just answered a few questions ago about a gal that didn't understand the points either.   You're not alone Braazzen ! ! !. Have a great day!. Hey...bonus info for yah...the first three letters of your nick name are the first Three letters of my last name....funny!I,ve been on for 5 months now, & seen scores up to the  thousands, & I think it,s just for need to know info, & well for funits just like agame in where u have levels and  points and it encourages u to answer more questions.
Well, you just have to hope people find where to change to global, I found it in 30 seconds, but some others might not realise where it is. Maybe the UK people could tell people they know in other countries about your questions, I don't really know though.The 8 ball says dont worry about the rules...i am in canada and i can see your question.After reading this, i can certainly reassure you the world will not wanna see another one of your questions.I am from the U.S. I can see your question fine.im from the us and i can see your Q. i think not only the UK people are gonna be able to see itoh well I am in america so you probably are getting answers from worldwideumm don't know what to tell you ,sorry. Theres thousands on here anyways so lots will see it. So don't worry be happy :)Did I miss a memo.. Why is it only the UK answering UK ?s now.As far as I can see, this site has a world wide audiencei am in Seattle . . so what u talking about Willis?
There are several programs that will give you a pop up when mail comes in, if you use Outlook or Express then just go to Control Panel -> sounds - sounds Tab and put a sound in for New Mail Notification.  Personally I use sysMetrix which gives me a message count as well as soundIt depends on what email program you are using. If you are using Yahoo! mail, you can get the Yahoo! Messenger, and as long as it is open it will notify you when an email comes. If you are using outlook express you can get into the settings, and it will make a noise when an email comes in.I desire that yahoo.com notifiy me I have email..............
well, i voted for your answer. maybe that will break the tie.they are trying to start a yahoo civil war......i think this is all an experiment to see how far they can push us....the Powers That Be are watching, be sure of that.  don't let 'em get your goat, girl.......Because 2 or more answer have the same amount of votes.

No-one is sending an email or is being filtered as junk mail.Check 2 see u register your address properly. Sent email 2 friend 2 see he receive it.May be no one has mailed u for a while. how do u know u r not receiving messges? try to send a mail to urself, to find out. if u really are not getting the mails. chk ur storage space. maybe ur space is already full.. tru to move some mails to a diffrent folder if that is the case.
They do the cookie so you can preview the new layout for the Yahoo homepage...If you don't have the cookie you don't see the new homepage.... . I personally don't like the new homepage so I delete the cookies every time to make it go back to the old page...Most websites use cookies to remember who a user is. If you have to log in to a site, it needs some way to remember you - a good thing and not necessarily spying.. . About the MRU, though, are you sure that was from Yahoo! Answers? They're usually created by programs. Some programs are set to automatically create one if the previous one was deleted. MRUs help you find files you recently accessed in the Recent Documents part of your start menu. They're very convient.
I don't tend to answer silly questions, I prefer to find the ones that are genuine and that I can answer, mostly about how to use Answers and getting Avatars.. I try not to answer people's questions that I know, cos then I feel like I'm pushing for a Best Answer from them, I know that I often feel obliged to give people best answers if I know them, so I try to avoid the situation.anser anything uo know u dont knowI choose the ones that are interesting. I also pick ones that seem to actually be seeking out answers rather than filling up this forum with inappropriate questions.One's that I can answer.I look for funny Q.. . . . --- LeeeNthe firstYeah a mixture of those two. I also have favourite categories that I will scan (Philosophy, books, society and culture, music movies, jokes)I just look at the question and make sure I know the answer. If I don't, I won't go there. . Also, I look at how many answers the question has. If it has alot, I'm not going to add to the confusion. If it just has 1 or 2 I'll check it out and if I can add input to it, I will.. I don't know anyone on here, so that rules that one out.Interesting, just like yours! ( that's a compliment!)!Ditto on AndyBob and CRT.I don't know anyone, so I choose the ones interest me.I look for interesting questions, like this one, and for questions to which I might actually know the answer.just pick the one u can answer.
It will be fixed.I'm having the same problem.  I wish they would fix it already.mabye their systems so messed up,they cant post an announcement?dunno...im sure they'll fix it by the end of the day^-^just read what people are postin till then...kinda fun!. .

Glad to know I am not the only one having that problem. Thanks for asking it, I'd love to hear what they say . . .There was an issue this intermittent login issue this morning that affected many of the Yahoo! Mail and Yahoo! Messenger users.  While it wasn’t an issue to login to Yahoo! Answers, as you can see that those affected by the login issue were able to come on here and ask questions, many Yahoo! sites/products were affected.  However, because I have premium (paid) Yahoo! services (i.e. Yahoo! Voice, Yahoo! Mail Plus), I was able to chat online (and call) the Yahoo! support team and just learned the problem is now solved.  We can now all login to Yahoo! websites and Yahoo! Messenger.Log out of everything, and shut down all internet windows, go to control panel, uninstall/remove programs, choose messenger. re-download it and install it againI don't know what's going on.  I can't connect to My Yahoo or Mail.  I just now was able to log in to Answers...I was having trouble with messenger last night too.i cant connect using the no proxys settings yet it was fine last nite i dont get it they need to get their ass's in gear im at college i need the messengerI can't sign in either..uninstalled and re-installed and still nothing. I am on the Canadian version of yahoo as well, and its not helping - lol... guess we all just wait.Seems to me there has been a LOT of difficulty using Yahoo mail lately.  Can you say "hotmail"?ANYONE FROM THE DIABETIC CHAT ROOM 1 SEND ME A REPLY

visitors is how many people have viewed your page. page views total number of pages looked at . if i go to your 360 and look at 4 pages it will look like this. visitors 1. page views 4I know this one. Page views means the number of the pages you have visited and visitors mean how many people have visited your page.A Page view is a term used in web analytics, and may generally be defined as a request to load a single page of an Internet site. On the World Wide Web a page request would result from a web surfer clicking on a link on another HTML page pointing to the page in question. This should be contrasted with a hit, which refers to a request for a file from a web server. There may therefore be many hits per page view.. . These page views may be counted. For the owner of the site this information can be useful to see if any change in the to the page (such as the information or the way it is presented) results in more visits. If there are any advertisements on the page, the advertisers would also be interested in the number of page views to determine their expected revenue from the ads. For this reason it is a term is used widely for Internet based marketing and advertising.. "visitors" may imply a number of unique ip addresses accessing the web site.Wow. Interesting question. My guess is that page views are just when people stop in to look around. Maybe a visitor is someone who stops to leave a comment? That's the only logical explanation I can think of, really. Hope you find out for sure.. . By the way, cool background.One visitor can visit many pages.
Try looking in your trash... if you just deleted it from your inbox it might still be there. but if you emtied your trash already then you won't be able to get it back. if you look in your send folder there might be a history of that e-mail... it just won't have what that peoson wrote last.Try looking in your "trash".If you are lucky, it may still be in your "Trash". If you deleted it a while ago, there is no way of retrieving it. Yahoo empty their trash folders on a regular basis even if you don't click on the "empty" button.

You get an email saying that you got no answers and your question gets deleted and you start crying like your avatar. Its never happened to me, and it probably won't happen to you either. You will at least get some stupid answer(this answer is a good example!)Nada!  You just feel sad cause no one cares enough to answer :(I have so you'll never know!IT PROBABLY GETS DELETED.Well, I guess you don't get any answsers then.After a while the question expires and the general public gets to vote the best answer.Nothing. You just won't get any answers.If a tree falls in the forest, and no one is there to hear. Will it make a sound?NothingYou actually get an email stating that no one answered your question.  It's a bit depressing.
It's a glitch in the new system.  They are working on it.  I saw this on their list of known problems.Shhh! I don't need to be told when my answers are the best, all it does its clog up my mail!

well, if you've been around yahoo, you know it's impossible to delete your account. Just stop using it then if you don't like it, and there's your "Quick fix". . I dunno why you can't delete it, you just can't delete anything yahoo related cause it all links to the same account.I say you just keep on trying your report to them until you get your answer from them. if you are piss off then don't click the button again.I GUESS YOU CAN'T JUST SING OUT OF YOUR ACCOUNT . .

Hmmm you must be the only one, or the lucky one atleast...UPDATE:. . Last week, there were some intermittent login issues last that affected many of the Yahoo! Messenger users (and some Yahoo! Mail users). While it wasn’t an issue to login to Yahoo! Answers, as you can see that those affected by the login issue were able to come on here and ask questions, some Yahoo! sites/products were affected. This intermittent issue occured from June 20th - June 22nd.am in Abu Dhabi - UAE and its not working tooi have this problem also.but i think it by yahoo server.......most of yahoo networks is having problem now.. don't worry, i still having problems with most of yahoo services, like IM and mail.dont know what the problem is...but its not working since quite a few hours todayDon't worry. Yahoo is having problems with its servers...Well I'm located in Malaysia and I have a UK account of yahoo. I can  check my mail and log on to messenger as well.I don't know why but mine isn't working either! Kinda agrivating!!
It allows you to have your own page, you can put links in it to sites you like to visit, write blog entries, message other people on 360, and make comments on other people's 360 blogs. I can't do it justice by writing about it, but it's actually quite good fun. Check some people's pages out to get a feel for it, and see if you want one.You are joking with this question, right?a free blog, rss feeds, hold photos, a great way to meet people and keep up with friends.   A lot like my space
No, but I did answer a question and the asker contacted me to complain about not liking my opinion. He was very rude. If he didn't want others' opinions he shouldn't have asked any questions.I think that's the reason why. The feature the internet  provides is anonymity.Nope that hasn't happened to meno

Happiness is a state of mind, it comes from within. If you are not happy with yourself and the environment around you then you are unhappy and need to look deep within yourself to find why. To find inner happiness you need to find inner peace.no, happiness comes from withinMany people put up a false front and try to give the impression they're happy when they're not, it's just more role-playing we all engage in. If you're not jumping with joy 24/7/365 you're normal, don't sweat it. life is ups and downs with a lot of ho-hum mixed in.Happiness is a choice.  You make your own happiness.Just spend times with some little kids; bcz they r innocent and cute. i do that ..They can't be happy if they are not happySome are called optimists- they always think positive no matter how harsh (or unhappy) the situation isthink of good things the person you love (if you aresad because of love then just forget about) go on a shopping spree spend time with the people you love ,who love you and feel good .
You are a very wise woman. Also you hit the nail on the head. LOLyou are correct you should never underestimate the power of stupid people in larger groups but non the less you should take time to relize your one of the stupid people in the lager group called yahoo question and answer so its kindaa retorical question isnt itMost other countries know this.  That fact is especially true when the leader of the stupid group is the stupidest of them all.  Hence, the United States of America is more feared than any nation has ever been feared by anyone ever.I's real smart fer a pinhead.LOLI resent that!yes the government has spent large sums of money studying the effects of so called normal people who get into large crowds and then all rationality goes right out the window.. the so called normal minded people now act like the rest of the now growing crowd..and if the crowd gets into a riot, so does all the people who would normally sit by themselves and say O;my what bad people that crowd is..but once inside that crowd, their mind snaps and they are now criminals and do criminal acts... or do what ever the large groups ( crowd ) does, even throw rock and bottles at anyone at all.... so yes there is SUPER power in large groups..... so why don't we as citizens do something about the ever growing problems in this country.... all we need to do s empower that crowd mentality and get things done.. so..WHAT DO YOU SAY ..lets just do it.. everyone write at least one letter to the government..telling them to fix something... smile. good luckI'm not stupid, I'm just boredYou should never underestimate the power of ANY people in large groups!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!That's so rude.we're not stupid, we have a vast knowledge in hundreds of subjects, how else do we come up with our great answers? cant underestimate the power of any people in large groups.I can only laugh at that question.. . But I say yes it does.That's usually the safe way to betLMAO! I love this question. I love it so much i had to comment and your answer is.... YES! HAHAHAHA!Yep some real idiots out there.
Because as much as this is an incredibly cruel activity it is culturally relevant in some societies. Personally I always barrack for the bull.because it is a certain culture that participates in this stupid and barbaric pastime
Go to view menu.. then to text size.. change the text size to larger one.... This will change the font size of the complete web page.. . There is no way to increase just the text size of the mail sent to you.hiiiiii, . why don't you try to copy the text to any other program  "say microsoft word " and do what evr you want to it.
I'm sorry about what happened to you, the same happened to me a couple weeks ago and I felt terrible. But now I really don't care about what they said cuz it just makes them look bad.  Yes, sadly there are bunches of people that do this.  The point in asking the question is that someone might give you a good answer you just got to wait and be patient and laugh at the bad answers and when the good ones come smile and be happy.yes they are all over here it is mostly teenagers that does iti totally know what you mean. i asked a question the other day and told me to grow up. made me feel horrible. said i was a child which im not. some peopel are just rude. if you cant say n e thing nice dont say it at all, i say.A lot of people have certain triggers on them that go off when they read a certain subject matter.  These subjects apparently are sensitive to them and they just have to put the person down who is addressing it because it makes them feel better.  Just realize this one thing..You will most likely never meet most of these people so son't let what they write get you down.  You are a good person.
Go to your Control Panel on your computer, then click Add or Remove Programs ........look for Yahoo! Messenger and then click it. The  unInstall wizard should guide you through the rest.click START button on ur desktop then go to Settings --> control pannel --> Add/remove program --> then click remove button in list of yahoo instant messengerWhat a dumb question!!!!!!!!!!!!! >=(  Do you not know how to use a computer... ADD REMOVE PROGRAMS uninstall
Dunno. U cant block idiots from answering either. More's the pity. There r some freakin knuckleheads on here.just don't come here, or look at the names before clicking on that link?. . no one's pointing a gun at your head to click on the questionsI think you mean "Childish", and you can't block them, you can only report them for misusing the system. Please see the Community Guidelines for those things that are reportable.You are mean........(am I one of your enemies???). . I don't think I've ever even SEEN any of your questions...... but I'll try to avoid them in the future.....okie dokie???I don't believe you have the power to block people off of the site, only from e-mailing you personally.Unfortunately, you can't block a specific user ID.sir can you please get a real problem?report themIt's just words.  People take potshots at me all the time, whenever I post a question or respond to a question.  Big whoop.  If you can't roll with the punches, maybe you should head for the hills.  That old adage "Sticks and stones may break my bones, but words can never hurt me", is so  silly because alot of people end up boo hooing over some silly nonsense said to them.  Whatever.
I suggest a fresh install of Yahoo! Messenger.  First, a fresh install will ensure you have the latest build of Yahoo! Messenger.  Also, a reinstall will write over any Messenger files that may have become corrupt and causing this crashing issue.  There are two versions of Yahoo! Messenger available.  Yahoo! just launched Yahoo! Messenger version 8.0, which includes plug-ins, integration of Yahoo! 360, Soundtrack, and Soundboard.  For version 8, just go to http://messenger.yahoo.com, click on the ‘Get it Now’ button, and follow the installation process.  If you are not ready for the beta, just click on the ‘Get version 7.5’ link located directly under the ‘Get it Now’ button to get the current version, version 7.5.The messenger directory might be corrupt, try this:. http://search2.cc.scd.yahoo.com/cct_search.php?ui_mode=answer&prior_transaction_id=345569&action_code=5&highlight_info=16789078,12,23&turl=http%3A%2F%2Fhelp.yahoo.com%2Fl%2Fus%2Fyahoo%2Fmessenger%2Fmessenger75%2Fmessenger%2Fmessenger-04.html&answer_id=7492529#__highlight. . If that doesn't work, you probably want to contact yahoo: http://add.yahoo.com/fast/help/us/messenger/cgi_feedback. . Or get live online support by going to http://voice.yahoo.com/voice_help.php and clicking on the 'Live Chat help' link on the right side of the page.alright this happened with me too. on my pc it happened because i had downloaded the alienware desktop theme . even though they were cool it switched off my yahoo so when i changed my theme back to windows theme it started working fine so chk if u have changed your theme
steal it backYou can change your password at the Account Manager Center. Log in to your account by clicking Mail, then typing in your Account Name and Password, then clicking Options on the top right corner, then clicking Account Information. Follow the on-screen directions to change your current password. Make sure your password has letters and numbers and some symbols to prevent hackers.cant u sign back in then it would be on ur comp and the other people would be signed out?. have a great dayGo to http://account.yahoo.com, sign in, then click on the Change Password link and enter a new password.  You'll have the new one, but the thief won't.do u remember the other information like birhtday and year nd zip code etc. .... if yes, then try .... . . if u don't remember then there is a way... re-hack ur own id.Well if you forgot the answer to your own secret question, then you're out of luck.  Supposedly Yahoo claims that no one can change your security question and answer.  I've read otherwise.  Anyways whether you forgot or if the hacker was smart enough to change your answer, you're out of luck unless you are a famous movie star or something.  Yahoo doesn't really seem to care about anyone's situation.  . . If you think you can remember your answer then you can get your account back by emailing Yahoo Account Security at account-security-help @ cc.yahoo-inc.com (I put two spaces around the @ so the address would show in full) ASAP. Let them know what happened to you and they will request you to answer 8 questions so they can verify the account is yours. If and only if you have all the answers to the 8 questions can they then give you back your account. . . You can also try to call Yahoo support at 408-249-1572 but they're no help at all and sound kinda like human robots.  One repeated phrase is "Oh I see".  I've called them enough to know this.  I want to say back "Oh you don't see".. . Anyways good luck....
Just add them.  To keep them however, do not preach scientology.I do not know. However; please do not reproduce any more.just add friend !!Haven't looked into it.Just add them in the option of "add friends". Easy as that lol.
Do you have a scroll button on your mouse?  if so try pressing the Control Key on your Keyboard and scrolling up.I don't think Yahoo! changed anything. The settings on your computer could have been changed by an outside server. This is easy to do if you have any file-sharing programs, such as: Kazza, LimeWire, etc.. You might try from your status bar menu, under "View" find "Text Size" & adjust the size of your text.. Otherwise, if your operating system is XP (& maybe others), you might want to "Restore Your Sysyem".. From your start menu, click "Control Panel" Then click: "Performance & Maintenence". In the upper left corner find "File Types" and under that, click "Restore System".  Then follow the instructions to back-date your system to a day when you didn't have the problem.  That should take care of it.spyware. has happened to me before. if you have XP, use system restore to take comp back to before this happened. get yourself a spyware remover program such as adaware se.you have not been here for a while thenGo to View on the toll bar, under text size change the settings to suit ur wish ...The font size changed sometimes on my computer too.I don't know how.
They are tortured with hot prongs.  Please don't report me );most abuse can be reported anonymously, and should be responded to as quickly as possible.  In the case of adult, you may be offered temporary shelter, with children, it depends on the severity.I believe they get some sort of warning e-mail telling them what they did wrong.  If enough people complain about the person's bad behavior, then they will have their account suspended. :)Wait-I'll report abuse for you. Don't be surprised if you see an email.Only Warn That Person Nothing Elseit sits in a YA workers inbox for  a while until he/she decides to do something - usually send a warning letter.it just depends they could get suspended from yahoo answers or they will just get a email im not sure i havent been reported and hope i never will be..but yahoo looks over it before they will do something about itwarning letternever reported any abuse, guess the abusers will have some warnings and their movements will be under watch ... if they get reported again, depending on degree of offense, they might get limited access to yahoo answers facilities...
Mine is acting weird as well. If you go in stratight from the main Yahoo! page instead of using the toolbar, it seems to work. Just keep trying.you may have to start all over again by rebooting your computer and download yahoo  again and deleted out the old yahoo and refresh all your settings your having a computer clench
They obviously don't share our wit and intelligence! . Maybe they think their points are gonna win them a prize or something?good question, . i have no idea,. thanks for the 2 points2 points... im not gonna thank u!because the question is silly. . thanx for the 2 points :d ;)thanks 2 points lolWell its mostly because it is a stupid question!. Thanks for the 2 points!thanks for the two points! ;)Thanks 2 points!!dunno but thanks for the 2 points2 points thanks2 points! hahahahahahadunno. very sad people. yes. dunno. because they are either  bored at work or bored at school or bored at homethey can't think of anything better to sayThey're trying to get to the highest levels they can by using the least amount of time.. . It's annoying when you have an actual question and you have some dolt reply with "dun kno thx 4 da points!!!!"Pretty predictable answers, huh?. . I guess they are waiting for their 'special thankyou' from Yahoo - maybe it will be educational vouchers for 'special' schools! LMAO!Why do they do it?  Why are they here? . . I ask the same question of all the ignorant people that populate this planet.  Maybe they are simply here for the entertainment of the intelligent people.  They are our "fools" to keep us laughing when we get too serious.It is hilarious isn't it. Its not even as though the points actually amount to anything tangible, apart from a position on the leader board. . . Having said that, it pays to get 'best answers' - I won tickets to the world cup, and also tickets to the final - sweeeeeet."Thanks for the 2 points"! I suspect they have nothing better to do and just cut and paste the sentence into everyones questions. I keep trying to answer questions sensibly in the hope that I'll get "Best Answer" for one, but - no luck yet!!!What do points make.....  ?. . Thanks for them anyway!If its a completely random, silly question where the person who asked the question isn't expecting real answers I always say,. . Thanks for the points!They just want to earn to points from you.they have nothing to say, just want to earn 2 points.. like me.. hi hi hiQuest for points.  I need 10 more, come on give them to me, I need just 10 more points,People who have really poor imagination for a start and have a special type of humour that should be preserved for a long time. In a cold dark cellar somewhere in ...I dunno somehere miserable in a jar of pickling stuff.. . come on, try to be different, but even with this question people have chosen the most obvious answer they can....did they think they would be the only one....it seems so, which to me is rather pathetic.. . Be original if you are going to answer a question you do not know the answer to. Huh ?I've not done this before but I can't resist now,. . Thank you for the two points. . I'm not sure that the question isn't as sad as the answer it's whingeing about.there just being polite and saying thank you. yoink! 2 points(as you can see I'm not too polite)you jsut gave every person who answered for a stupid question two points just because you mentioned it and they probably do it for kicks like this....Thanks for the two points dumb assssPerhaps their is a prize for being top of the leader board,so any old answer gives you points.I think their should be a league table for the most best answers which would cut a lot of the crap answersyeah its proper annoying - its not as if you get anything for them!!They have way too much time on their hands.Report them. 'Gaming for Points'out of all these thanks it wont be hard deciding who gets the ten right?Thanks for the 2 points!!. . . . . . . . . Lol. In reality I know exactly what you are saying, and some people even go as far to say 'haha... you lost 5 points asking that question!!!'. . Like..................I have probably 9,999,999,999,999,999,999,999 more things to care about than points on Yahoo answers. It really is quite irrelevant to my life... but each to their own I guess.I have done this a couple of times because the question didn't make any sense.They have lost the connection between actually answering the question and the 'race' for points.. . Apart from a violation of Yahoo rules, such an answer says a lot about them and their motivation.  I would be surprised if such folks had the attention span to get to any level on the site.. . In short answer for the fun of it ... the points are pretty meaningless.Mr. Owlings is correct you can report them for 'gaming for points'. . . You kind of answered your own question there too, if you just remove the why do bit, that's your answer!And why do people answer a question you have asked with:. . nope. not sure. what is it. . What is the point of answering a question when you have no idea of the answer, crazy mo fo's.  . you get the gist
It's the size of the picture. Once they make it small it messes it all up! I had the same problem with some of my pictures. If you go thur the trouble of resizing them it helps some.. ?you might also want to rotate your picture with an image editor...:)Resize you're picture
answers by a landslide. the local mcd's is horribly slow. I'm fuming hereanswers, because i never go to mcdonaldsanswersdepends on the question and the mcdonalds.answer for my questions ofcourseAnswers for my questions, I normally have to repeat myself at least once when I order at McDonalds and most the time something isn't ready.Answer to my questions. It's not longer "fast food".it depends on the question.Answers- any day - as long the questions are stupid ( like this one!)
Sorry. We didn't want to tell you this, but at the last meeting we decided to disband the group.About 10 min. ago I found it hard to connect. I though it was me.I heard earlier today that there was some worm affecting yahoo mail users--maybe it is related to that.because it is temporarily out of service...maybe some maintenance is being done or somethinghhhhmm  maybe  because it is temporarily out of service. duhhhhCongratulations!  Your group is coming in loud and clear in Toronto!  :-)  Welcome back.

u dont like the answer?? then stop ASKING questions if you are NOT prepared to take other peoples point of view!! u asked a question and we answer and because U dont like what we say ,U want to retaliate.. . get a lifeAs far as I know, all you can do is add details to your question.  . . I suppose you could pick it as the "best answer" which allows you to comment, but I doubt you want to do that.You can add details to your question or you can e-mail them privately, if they allow that option.I don't think you can respond in the same way you do to a question, but you can probably click "Add Details" on the right side of the question page and write the person's name and a comment.click on there name below the piccy and wallaCheck if they have allowed email contact in their profile.If they and you are contactable, you can go to their profile and send an email or IM. You could also possibly go to their blog as some allow you to leave comments. If that is not an option, you can add details or you can put a comment underneath when you choose a best answer. You don't have to choose that persons answer to comment on it. Then after that you could even put another comment in the comments box which appears after your best answer is chosen.You can add details to your question.  Respond there if you wish.
go to my "Q&A" button on the top righthand side and click on that and then when it comes up go to edit my info and then scroll down to the yahoo im and then and uncheck that box!  then it won't make people im you!. . hope this helpsThe quickest way to get to it is by way of Yahoo Answers.

Click on "Edit my info," and make your changes.well, yuou go to the top to "move". then u click on tha and click new file and you name it and it will go in there
In Yahoo! Messenger, select the 'My Contact Details'.  Here, you can enter a nick name, which takes precedence over the first/last name.  Therefore, just enter the nick name you want to show, click 'Save and Close' and your nick name will appear on your friends' Messenger list.Click On Messenger and select My Contact Details and in there u can edit your last name.
Go to ur email page, click on options> general preferences> from name> type ur new name here> save. It will solve ur problem.click options (along top of colored box in mail). then click general preferences. . hope that helpswhat program do you use?
That is a feature of Internet Explorer 6.0. Download it from Microsoft and enjoy.Sounds like you just need to download the newer version.  . . You can do so here:. . http://toolbar.yahoo.com/
I am not really sure about this, but maybe your computer does not have the latest version of macromedia flash player or something like that. Thats all I could think  that might cause it.. . If you don't mind using a very simple version of Yahoo Messenger then you can do this: Go to the Yahoo homepage and click Messenger. Go to the bottom of the screen and click Launch Web Messenger. That will take you to a simple version of Yahoo Messenger.you connection is not connecting to the network. ISP might be overloaded at this time day with everyone logging on. Sometimes there are infrequent outtages on Yahoo.. . Hey go and get a coffee and come back!
I am showing updates real-time.  To test, try using Yahoo! Answers from a different computer.it only takes a second on my computer.who really gives a shi*.I dunno.. . . . . . . . . . . Try to upgrade your PC.....it always updates on my computer.........maybe ur puter is running slowI don't know probably bad connection or something good luck with that!!!!its your computer upgrade or just live with itit's okay u r right same thing happens with me.got meIt's all about connection, server and speed. When you post a a question, this take some time for the question to be received at the Yahoo! Answers database, and then it takes some time to automatically upload into Yahoo! Answers. If you're staying too far away from the location of Yahoo! company, then your question will appear very late.HMMMMM, TOO MANY PPL, OR JUST LAG FROM UR COMPUTER, OR SOME DAYS ARE BUSIER THAN OTHERS. OR JUST SERVER NOT MAINTAINED ON A REGULAR BASIS.you need a new computerYou're just too slow. Shouldn't you be training for cross country? Congrats on level 3, CRACKA
This has happened to me. However if I open my email account up on a different computer or as a different user on the same computer it lets me in and works as normal.. Switching it of and on again does not work.. Hope this helps.I'll be honest I don't know but I have the same problem and can get no support from yahoo which seems the norm, suggestions about clicking the wrong button I just find annoying. I hope you find the cause.Maybe you are clicking the 'Compose' button on the front screen by accident.  That would account for the behaviour you are seeing.

There was an issue this intermittent login issue this morning that affected many of the Yahoo! Mail and Yahoo! Messenger users.  While it wasn’t an issue to login to Yahoo! Answers, as you can see that those affected by the login issue were able to come on here and ask questions, many Yahoo! sites/products were affected.  However, because I have premium (paid) Yahoo! services (i.e. Yahoo! Voice, Yahoo! Mail Plus), I was able to chat online (and call) the Yahoo! support team and just learned the problem is now solved.  We can now all login to Yahoo! websites and Yahoo! Messenger.Log out of everything, and shut down all internet windows, go to control panel, uninstall/remove programs, choose messenger, uninstall it. redownload and reinstall it. This is messing everything up. If you don not have messenger install, uninstall and reinstall internet explorer or whichever program you use.hi there.  here's an easy way to figure out the problem:. . 1) login via the web messenger: http://messenger.yahoo.com/webmsgr/fmsgr.php. . 2) if that works, your account is fine, and it's a temporary solution when you can't log in.  . . 3) if you don't use voice, and don't plan to, you can go back to the old one here: http://www.download.com/Yahoo-Messenger/3000-2150_4-10429465.html. . 4) if you can't login via the web messenger, then something's wrong with your account and you should contact customer care.. . good luck!. . hope this helps.  if so, please resolve your question and vote for a best answer...that way it helps us answerers from duplicating efforts.  thank you!yes..messenger/yahoo mail not working . most of us r facing this problem.messenger. yes we cant log in but mail.... YES!!! Good news!!!. Here's the trick.... Yahoo mail is facing a server problem. But as they say... "where there is a will there is a way", I know the way to sign in.. The trick is..... First you will promise me that you will rate my answer the best.. The trick is click on "mail" written on the same page your looking at.. In the left corner.... It will work.. It worked for me.. I will wait for my 10 points....
Just click them, if they do not work you may need to update the Yahoo software you are running and in the options click repair.They work if you click on them. If they don't it's time to update your yahoo messager to another and better yahoo messager.
Because people usually think what they know is right. And they do not take the time to research an answer, instead they are in a hurry to answer and give out wrong info.Well, maybe they think they know what they are talking about. Which makes them think they are right.On some questions, people give answers that they truly believe are correct.because they want 2 points for answering a questionI especially love the ones who claim to have PHDs and grace us with their knowledge (gotten directly from wikipedia). . If you're out there, you know who I mean.Points2 points. woohoo!Straight from the gut answer: . . Lake Wobegon effect. People think they're smarter than they actually are. And, since there's no real filter mechanism on this site, there's no incentive to think a fully-formed response.Because people want to be smart about everything even when they are not. When truly you should just keep your mouth shut if you don't know any better.Because they want people to think that they are smart and for points. It's annoying.To make people like you ask mean questions, DUH!if you knew the correct answer why did you ask the question?
On the 8.0 Beta version you can right click on the persons name you do not want to see you and then go to stealth and select invisible to that one person.  Or you can post that you are busy with the arrow next to available but sometimes friends do not think that means you cannot talk. LOLclick on "messenger", than "privacy options", than check the box that says "always signin as invisible". . if you want to be visible, or invisible to only one or two people right click over there name, choose stealth settingsYou can use stealth setting to show that you are offline , right click on a persons name click on stealth then click "show offline" or click where it says messenger then click on privacy...at the top of the page put a check mark in the box that says show offline to users.. Hope that this helps you.Just type a note of apology to friends, and tell em you don't wanna  be disturbed
you have to make a new one. the old one will not work aney more.just wait 5/6 months and it will be deleated.go to yahoo help,,or call 800 myyahooget another ID, if your OTHER Id is not used within 6 months, it will be deleted.Click on Lost Password and change itbut you old yahoo screeen name for as a lost pass word thats how u do that
if i changed it would it make you happy? I'm not being a smart a$$, i'd really like to know. it's a pic of my husband with our 2 girls.No one wants to live in reality, they only wont to live in fantasy. they are trying to hide there true self or not worth looking at...In order to remain anonamous I suppose.I am assuming that most people do not have their 360 account online. I know that I did not until I was ready to make my picutre my avatar.Those users that do not have a pic at all often do not know how to get one: http://answers.yahoo.com/search/search_result;_ylt=AsGEc2NgN13VsPZ_wn4jJsPzy6IX?p=display+avatar. http://answers.yahoo.com/search/search_result;_ylt=AsGEc2NgN13VsPZ_wn4jJsMjzKIX?p=show+avatar. http://answers.yahoo.com/search/search_result;_ylt=AsGEc2NgN13VsPZ_wn4jJsPzy6IX?p=get+an+avatar. . Also, you need to be 18 to have a Y! 360 account and many users on here have not reached that age yet.. . Or it could be that they just like their privacy and anonymity.Because people want to look like cartoons and be unoriginal.. . . . So many people are "paranoid" that someone might recognize them and they do it for security reasons. (WTF?). . Oh, please, let's all find a four leaf clover. . . Do you recognize me?Because then I can pretend to be pretty, duh!. . no, jk. just cause I like avatars, and they are easier than downloading photos all the time, since the avatars I change often.The Avatar is easier and still anonymous.I guess because people wanna be creative, they don't want a ready made picture. They create some image all by themself.becuase lots of people dont really want other people seeing their faces becuase of curtain reasonsBecause I don't want people to know who I really am.  It's fun being incognito.  Besides, my Avatar is far better looking and younger than I am. I did try to match my Avatar to my real look, but .... well, we think we look good.. . Why incognito?  Safety - pure and simple safety.  There are too many weird people in the world and I just don't want to chance one of them will try to find me.Possible reasons:. 1. Does not know how to upload picture.. 2. Does not want to upload picture.. 3. Too Lazy to upload picture.. 4. The sense of security because they do not know what you actually look like.. 5. Thinks avatar is better than picture.. 6. Does not own camera.. . And more that I just haven't thought of at the moment.Because the Avatars are fun to make.When you sign up it will take your avatar - something that many of us who have Instant Messenger use - or your Photo from the 360 page, which not many of us have started (it seems to me).
You gotta kill the queen....or else they will just relocate if you destroy the mound and she is still alive.. . They make poison for them in the form of food they like.

yahoo is a company of saboteurs. They take advantage of all of their bitches through manipulation by sending and implanting viruses into your hard-drive and your software, it is a scam that has made them billions of dollars. People talk about Bill Gates being the creator and Devil of windows and Microsoft and they consider him a monopolizer ... and he his, but yahoo is just as guilty of ruining the computer experience and forcing their monopoly on the peopleIf you already have a Yahoo! ID, you do not need to SIGN UP for messenger.  The sign up link is only if you DO NOT have a Yahoo! ID.  Therefore, just go to http://messenger.yahoo.com and download the software.  There are two versions of Yahoo! Messenger available.  Yahoo! just launched Yahoo! Messenger version 8.0, which includes plug-ins, integration of Yahoo! 360, Soundtrack, and Soundboard.  For version 8, just go to http://messenger.yahoo.com, click on the ‘Get it Now’ button, and follow the installation process.  If you are not ready for the beta, just click on the ‘Get version 7.5’ link located directly under the ‘Get it Now’ button to get the current version, version 7.5.. . Once downloaded, just login using your Yahoo! ID and password to start using Yahoo!

Yahoo 360 is similar to a my space. You can make lists, have a shoutout box, have pictures, and blog. It's like your own personal space where you can post whatever you want. You can also customize the page with different themes.Yes, but not as much as Myspace.is a blogger where u can post whatever u like u can add friends and photos to it as well .I am not sure bout that cause I am a little kidYahoo 360 is basically a Yahoo myspace and yes it is very fun check out other people's 360 pages to get an idea.

Just click the paperclip under "Subject" and you go right to a preview of the attachment.. . It's already there...The shortcuts you are referring to are part of the new Yahoo! Mail search feature.

There is no published schedule for roll outs.

What are you talking about?. . I'm a mac user and I've yet to find anyting on yahoo I couldn't do.Yahoo does not know whether you have a PC or a Mac.yahoo does support mac for most of it's services.  what do you mean by address transfer?  please explain and I'll do my best to elaborate on your specific product need, if I can find out.
I have done it, only because I missed spelt a word but i thought that i never sent the other question out mean while 2 of them went out..or they prob. didn't see a ques. like their's posted on the site, so they ask it.to get more answers! i do it all the time...oops.sry!Because they're stupid people.Because they were most probably not satisfied with the responses they received when initially asked.thats alittle too retoricle dontcha think. just wasting as much space that the ppl who type the same question 10s of timesThey want a different answer than what they have been given in the first place!. Not satisfied with the answers they have gotten. Want affirmation.to get more answers to there questionPerhaps they didn't get a good enough answer the first time.  . Once a question has been asked for about a day or so it seems to get lost.  If you don't get a good answer by then, your question could be lost to people who might be able to answer it.  So you repost it.they prob. dont get the right answer.
i think u cant cancel it . so forgot the yahoo 360. that is the best way. bye. take careYou can't really.  Just delete all info and pics and friends, set all privacy/contact etc settings to private/just me, uncheck the simple url, change your nickname to a nothing {...  or :-(   }, make sure that no one can see anything and that you have left an empty shell... sad to see you go,,, too bad.
its a hindi word. a persons avatar is the thing which represents one's identity when he himself cant do. . so honey plz learn hindisry to disappoint u i don't know(lol)A digital representation of you in the virtual world; a graphical image of a user.I think that's a Chinese name for a cartoon face...sorry. . i don't know !! lolwikipedia (which everyone uses on here) says its just like a virtual reality symbol like a buddy icon. it originated from hinduism, an indian religion. seems kinda dumb to me...In Hindu religion, an avatar is a human representation of a god.  . So it's really just another way to say representaion or icon or symbol.Yes. Joe is right. Avatar is Sanskrit word. In Hindu religion, there are 10 Avatars of Lord Vishnu.AVATAR is a hindi word belongs from india. d meaning of this word is SHADOW of d person1784, from Sanskrit. avatarana "descent" (of a deity to the earth in incarnate form), from ava- "down" + base of tarati "(he) crosses over; An embodiment, as of a quality or concept; an archetype: the very avatar of cunning. ; A temporary manifestation or aspect of a continuing entity: occultism in its present avatar.
for me, it's about helping other people...but sometimes i find myself in the suveys and polls section or trying to console guys saying their penis size really DOESN'T matter if they are loved. lol. hey...thanks for the best answer before! :)just earning some knlowedge from thisreports for gaming for points.!!   Well not reallyPoints dude, it's all for the points....Plus I just like doing it.cause I'm bored and smarter than you4-fun!!whaohTo help askers,my self ,and to have a fun learning time.1- try to help by answering people question . 2- to earn pointsWhat kind of question is that?  It doesnt make a bit of sense.to have fun... to make friend... to get points mean nothing to me
people dont always come back to the question they asked and therefore it gets put into a vote automatically. . therefore they never really get resolved by the asker but by the voters instead.Because they don't know how too.Some questions just are not that interesting. Its a hit or miss situation.just becausethey're lazyI didn't resolve a couple of mine because:. . 1. in one case, nobody knew the answer but still decided to leave pointless messages like "Oooh, I dunno, but good luck with it!".. . 2. in the other, a serious medical questions, I was called a c*ock-sucking sl*t.. . In the first case I left it unresolved and nobody gave any answer best answer so it was deleted. In the second case I deleted the question.. . I'd imagine people don't resolve them because they are not satisfied with the answers they have received.I put my recent questions to the vote because I wasn't sure what the best answer I was looking for was.
Happens to me too, I think it is just an error. Hopefully the next version won't have this problem.Perhaps it's hidden in your tool tray.  Try opening it from there.. . Or, the messenger directory might be corrupt, try this:. http://search2.cc.scd.yahoo.com/cct_search.php?ui_mode=answer&prior_transaction_id=345569&action_code=5&highlight_info=16789078,12,23&turl=http%3A%2F%2Fhelp.yahoo.com%2Fl%2Fus%2Fyahoo%2Fmessenger%2Fmessenger75%2Fmessenger%2Fmessenger-04.html&answer_id=7492529#__highlight. . If that doesn't work, you probably want to contact yahoo: http://add.yahoo.com/fast/help/us/messenger/cgi_feedback. . Or get live online support by going to http://voice.yahoo.com/voice_help.php and clicking on the 'Live Chat help' link on the right side of the page.

Off-Line Content.  Note that the more stored web-pages you have the longer this will take.  If it . . takes a few minutes to do, you should have done this a long time ago.. .   - Hint 3:  Do this every month or so, depending on how much surfing you do or if you find yourself . . on a page of dubious content. .   - Hint 4:  Click the settings button and set "Check for newer versions of stored pages:" to "Every . . visit to the page".  Not doing this will essentially read the page from your hard drive instead of . . the website and you will not see the latest changes.. .   - Hint 5:  The amount of disk space to use for stored pages should be relatively small -- figure . . less than 10% of your total drive space (i.e. 10% of a 40GB drive is about 4GB or 4,096MB).  Just a . . rule of thumb, but that's still a LOT of web pages.

They haven't touched the computer in several minutes. So if you message them, they probably won't answer back since they've been away from the computer a long time.ITS MEANS U ARE AWAY FROM UR COMPUTER AND THE MOUSE HAVEN'T EVEN MOVED..idle- means idling...heh. . sorry, I couldn't resist.  When you or someone you know is listed as Idle it means they have not done anything involving their messenger in some time.  (ie a car idling, motor running but not going anywhere and in park). . If an ID on messenger is listed as idle, it means they have not done anything Yahoo related with that ID in some specified time.  It could mean simply they are lagged by internet problems....or it could be as serious as a slight electrical hum.  (enought to power their systems but not enough to power the monitor) whatever the case is, it means they are not using that ID at the moment.. . If it is your ID or account, you can either ignore it, or change your preferences in messenger to a different amount of time or even off completely.Just means there has been no activity in the applicationit means that they arent at the computer or havent been on for a whileit means the are away from the computerthat they have not responded or attempted to respond for an amount of time, you can set when idle is displayed on your mess. tooIf you don't move your mouse and did not type any key in the key board and you are on line in Yahoo messenger will set to status as Idle. The default time is 15 Min's.it means that that person's mouse hasn't movedwhen your screen saver comes up

I'm having the same type problem if i click on anything like the smileys or something then messenger shuts down...I uninstalled and reinstalled...same troubleyou have a virus..  I had the same problem.. I had to delete all the tool bars(go into your add/remove programs and delete them all ) re download one & only use one.. you can also run your anti virus program & try to get rid of it that way......  I found out also that there is one attched to Explorer so I don't go on the web with it....Microsoft told me that...  Also more than one anti virus can  cause problems too...yahoo has many issues these days, all seemingly connected to bad overloads of servers.  You can do nothing about it.
Just click on "Bulk." This will also allow you to edit your folder.The Bulk folder is your Spam folder.. . To stop receiving unwanted email, do the following:. . Log into your Email, go to Options (upper right hand side). Go through all your settings and don't forget to save them too. . . Under Spam Protection, make sure your Spam Guard is turned ON. Option to immediately delete all Spam messages. This will force all new email to redirect to your Inbox. Option to Block messages that you mark as Spam. If you plan on keeping your . Bulk folder, also option messages you mark as Not-Spam to be moved to your Inbox. Always Option to Block all Images until you can look them over first. This prevents spammers from knowing you opened their email. Save Changes. . . Under Blocked Addresses, type in spammer.com, this will stop all Spam that has been reported to Yahoo from ever entering your email. I recommend you remove everything on your list first. This will give you a fresh start after you type in the "spammer.com". . . Under General Preferences, Folders/Search Results, Special Folders, option to redirect incoming unsolicited email to the Bulk Folder. Save. . . If you get email from someone you don't know, NEVER open it (it may contain viruses) and report it as SPAM. This will automatically block it from your email account. When you do open an email that is Spam, you have alerted the sender that your account is Active. . . This should slow down the Junk Mail considerably. I only get maybe one or two Spam emails a Month. . . Good Luck!
Please follow this path. Tools > internet options > content > auto complete > clear forms. To stop the generation of history, please uncheck the box of form. U will get ur problem solved.what she said.... have you been looking at porn? XDDELETING SEARCH HISTORY. . Interenet Explorer --. . EASY and Quick -- You should do this often. .   - TOOLS / INTERNET OPTIONS. .   - On the GENERAL Tab, click the 'Clear History' Button in the 'History' section. .   - Hint 1:  While you're there, you might want to look at the second section entitled 'Temporary . . Internet Files'.  I routinely click on 'Delete Cookies' ... more on Cookies later.. .   - Hint 2:  You might want to click the 'Delete Files' button too -- Ensure that you delete all . . Off-Line Content.  Note that the more stored web-pages you have the longer this will take.  If it . . takes a few minutes to do, you should have done this a long time ago.. .   - Hint 3:  Do this every month or so, depending on how much surfing you do or if you find yourself . . on a page of dubious content. .   - Hint 4:  Click the settings button and set "Check for newer versions of stored pages:" to "Every . . visit to the page".  Not doing this will essentially read the page from your hard drive instead of . . the website and you will not see the latest changes.. .   - Hint 5:  The amount of disk space to use for stored pages should be relatively small -- figure . . less than 10% of your total drive space (i.e. 10% of a 40GB drive is about 4GB or 4,096MB).  Just a . . rule of thumb, but that's still a LOT of web pages.  I spend lots of time on the internet surfing . . all over the place -- Mine is set at 300MB and I have almost a terabyte of disk space.. .  - On the CONTENT Tab, click the AUTO COMPLETE button.  Click the "Clear Forms" button.  This will . . delete the stuff that you've previously typed into various web-pages.. . GOOGLE AND OTHERS . . This is a great source:. . 	http://www.searchenginewatch.com/sereport/article.php/2165181. . . COOKIES and OFF-LINE CONTENT. . Cookies are small files left on your computer by web-pages to record little things.  They are not . . all bad.  When you key in your zip code on Yahoo Weather on the home page and say "Save this" -- it . . does -- in a little Cookie File.  This way, the next time you visit the site, it 'remembers' your . . zip code.  Fantastic !. . Banking sites remember your passwords, your account numbers ... Great ?  Would you like a copy of . . your bank account number posted on the internet ?  It can be arranged !. . The point is not to be too afraid, but to be responsible.

Delete your history, delete your cookies.  Delete your off-line content.. 2. Empty your Recycle Bin. 3. Run Disk Defragmenter ( Start / Programs / Accesories / System Tools / Disk Defragmenter). . This will take a while.  You should close EVERYTHING down and leave the computer alone for the 5-30 . . minutes this takes.  It's a good thing to do before you go to bed or before you leave for work.. . You should perform the above steps approximately monthly or more frequently.. . VIRUS STUFF AND SEARCH HISTORIES / COOKIES. . Never, ever update your anti-virus definitions before you clear out your computer as per above.. . It's also a very good thing NOT to rely too much on automatic updates ... Sometimes, again, about . . once a month or so, you'll want to MANUALLY update your virus defintions.  If something isn't right, . . you'll have at least an opportunity to see that it isn't.  Too many times, people believe that their . . defintions are being kept current, when it's simply been bombing/crashing in the middle of the night . . and exiting without doing anything.  This is so simple that I still can't believe people don't know . . this:  As a former hacker, what do you honestly think the very first thing I'm would do to your . . computer was ?  Duh, Disable your auto-updating !!!. . SPYWARE / ADI know what you are talking about but I've tried that before myself I don't think you can.You need to turn off Auto Complete and then go and then go and clear your history. You can do this by going to a browser window and then to Tools, Internet Options, then under the General Tab you will see History at the bottom and you can set the parameters to how long to keep the information in history or you can clear it so that you don't have it pop up again.

You cannot know if someone has read your mail if they mark the message they read as UNREAD.  Therefore, to prevent any abuse of your Yahoo! Mail, I strongly suggest changing your password.  If you do not, they may change it for you and you may have a hard time gaining access to it if you do not remember your registration information required to regain access to the account.email to yourself--- a nasty message to "them" hahahaThere is one way to find out if someone has read ur email. that is u wont have any new emails in your in box(i mean all ur mails would be read not high lighted). If the person is smart they might select those new emails and click on "mark as unread". So basically its a 50/50 chance u will know if someone has read it.
Follow this path. Go to ur email page> options> Block address > list of blocked addresses> find the address which u want to unblock> select that> remove> save. It will solve ur problem.In yahoo mail, go to mail options, then blocked addresses, then remove the address of the person you want to unblock.If they are not in the Block Address list then add their Email Address to your Address Book or Contacts List. With and Emails that are being classified as spam and you don't want them to be, then add them to the Address Book. Then the server will put them in your inbox.
U cant do this. This feature has not been provided by yahoo yet for yahoo answers.I don't think you can customize anything on Yahoo! Answers.. You can only pick you avatar and your info in your profile.IMPOSSIBLE!!!!!!!. you just have to like ithave not done that yet .don't think it possible
I've never called someone's computer.nothing much the screen just pops up and states you have a call do you choose to accept or deny and it depends on the company that you are usingit answers.For PC2PC calls with Messenger, your buddy will receive a pop-up window indicating that there is an incoming call from you.  They have the option of answering or declining the call.  For Phone2 PC calls, they also receive a pop-up window indicating your incoming call from your phone number (as long as your number is not blocked).  If you call someones PC and they are offline, you will connect to their voicemail as long as their voicemail box is not full.
i have the same problem! someone fix it plssssssits world wide on all servers id expectwtf, you are what the 100th person who asked this. it's starting to annoy people.There was an issue this intermittent login issue this morning that affected many of the Yahoo! Mail and Yahoo! Messenger users.  While it wasn’t an issue to login to Yahoo! Answers, as you can see that those affected by the login issue were able to come on here and ask questions, many Yahoo! sites/products were affected.  However, because I have premium (paid) Yahoo! services (i.e. Yahoo! Voice, Yahoo! Mail Plus), I was able to chat online (and call) the Yahoo! support team and just learned the problem is now solved.  We can now all login to Yahoo! websites and Yahoo! Messenger.It was the server.  We seem to be ok now.  try again.This is getting to be to funny now.I seem to have the same problem with Yahoo Messenger from time to time and it usually will connect after a few minutes. Don't pay any attention to rude people like this bugsie person who gave you a rude reply. This Yahoo Answers is an excellent place to come if you have questions similar to the one that you just asked. I am not a tech but you can always email this question to Yahoo Help and hopefully they will reply with the correct answer of why this is happening. When I logged on this morning my Yahoo Messenger didn't load right away but I was able to use my Firefox to go online and use the internet immediatly and Yahoo Messenger came on after a few minutes. Strange.... but I have encountered this same thing before.Sometimes when you get that message it means someone else has logged into your account.  But.. I see that there have been some server problems so that may not be the case.Hi. The problems are occurring with a lot of Yahoo users currently.....apparently Yahoo is doing updates or their system may be down. I'd try again in 30 minutes or so.Hmmmmmm this aint the first time! Im about togive up on yahoo... been using it for 6 years and never have i been so pissed off! :( spose to be meeting my husband on yahoo like 5 mins ago, he is in iraq and i havent spoken to him in 6 weeks now! Thanks yahoo ... WAn.kers
they do it. . but not in hell. over here onlyi don't know they are smart like that i guessIt's that people spend 24 hours answering, rating, voting, commenting,and asking obsessively.They don't have a life or a job.No one on this site has ever answered 9000 questions a week. If you're referring to the number of points in a week, that's something different. However, the weekly totals listed right now are incorrect due to a glitch in the system and are actually displaying multiple weeks.. . But some users do come online everyday to vote and rate their limits, answer questions to the best of their ability and also get some thumbs up on earlier best answers. It takes some time (not a full day definitely), but it does add up.. . ** edit **. Sorry, if you were referring to the number of questions answered that is listed on the weekly scoreboard, that is actually the total number of questions that have ever been answered by that user.Answering questions can be addicting, but 9,000?  That's crazy!. This person must not have a life and be a brainiac!  . I don't think there is no other way that someone would have sufficient knowledge to answer this many questions!  . Then again....maybe this person is just posting really stupid answers.  Either way they still can't have a life posting 9,000 answers a day!I have often wondered this also.. . But given the content on some "answers" it seems that some have developed bots to "game" the system.Hmm... maybe they're unemployed like me?Maybe they do have a job, but maybe that job has alot of down time.....
I don't know.hail stones are just frozen water.. An  ice layer forms when the hailstone collects small, really cooled liquid water drops that freeze rapidly on impact, thereby trapping air bubbles within the ice and giving it a "milky" texture. When larger cooled water drops impact on a hailstone, the freezing is slower, allowing the air bubbles to escape, and thus forming clear ice.When rain forms and starts to fall strong updrafts of air push the rain up to higher and colder altitudes.  The rain freezes and begins to fall as small ice crystals.  The updrafts keep cycling the small ice balls back up into the cold air and the small ice ball gets a little bigger each time until it is too heavy for the updraft to push it back up.  It then falls to the ground as hail even if the ground temperature is very warm.
If you click on a user's avatar or name, you will be redirected to their profile, if they have enabled email contacts you will be able to send them messages. Note that you cannot see the user's email but you will be able to send messages through Y!A internal server.Go to Yahoo mail, put the receivers email address in and write away
Put you mouse arrow over the picture on the bottom on the screen that you want to delete and right click. There should be an "exit"  option, Choose this and should delete. If it still won't and you want to totally delete from your system go to PRogram Files and/or Add or Remove PRograms to remove that way. Good luckput your mouse pointer on the thing you want gone, and right click on your mouse and then click on close in the menu that pops upyou can either right click on them and click close or you could click on them and click the x in the right hand corner of the screen.right click on the thing you dont want and then look for remove from listgo on to your control panel and delete the symbols u dont want

You don't.  Take your lumps and stay away from the woman and stop bothering her.  Shame on you for even asking.Go to court on the response date given on the restraining order.  If you can convince the judge that the restraining order has no basis he can over turn the restraining order.  If you missed the date. Oh well.. DO NOT phone, mail, email, or attempt to approach or talk to the one who filed.  Any or all of the above can be considered breaking the restraining order and you can be arrested.Obey it and it won't be extendedFirst of all, “Obey it!,” and "Do Not!" talk to the person who filed it! Take it serious.. . There is a chance if you work through a lawyer that you can get it dropped but you need to be careful. This is not something to take little.talk to the person who filed it, ask them to drop itBehave yourself, and maybe it'll be the last one you get.
From yahoo? It may be because you have your spam guard on and if Yahoo is not in your address book,the mail will  be delivered to the bulk folder.If you're referring to the e-mails that are obviously spam but appear to be addressed to someone else, you're not alone.  With all the recent spam laws, some people have decided they can profit by making the e-mail appear to have been sent to someone else.  Then, if you do manage to track them down via ISP, their defense can be that it wasn't sent to you....it was delivered by mistake.  Whatever you do, don't try to click on the links to unsubscribe unless it is a reputable company.  Many of these types of messages are sent to random e-mail addresses, and if they learn you actually received it, be prepared for an onslaught of messages from different addresses but with the same text.
First, click the question you want to add to your watch list. Second, look at the upper right hand corner of the monitor, you will see a little window there.. Third, click "Add to my Watchlist".

I guess it serves the same purpose for tracking a person, too.You can't really put SOMEONE on your Watch List, you can put SOMETHING on your Watch List. Like a question that interests you. Go the right top corner of the question page, and you'll see two options, one is "Email Question" and the other is "Add To Watch List". Click the "Add To Watch List" one.  =)little + called 'add to watch list" on rightside of their questions.

You can no delete a question once it has been resolved or goes to a vote. This feature is only possible for open questions.. . The only way to get old questions removed is to report abuse on them if there is a violation.U can delete questions only if they are in the open category. Once the question is resolved or put to vote, that cannot be deleted. So it is not possible now to delete those questions which r not in the open category.look on the right side of your question
As much as I don't like answering a question with another question, in this case, I have no choice if I really want to help you.. .

No you cannot remove a blog comment.  I don't know your situation.  Here are a couple of things you might consider:. . If you have any issue with the person who owns the blog you remarked on, you can try messaging them to say sorry,  In other words, lean on the pleasant side to retract your comment with an apology.. . As already said, follow through with a retraction comment of anything you may have said that was derogatory; but do keep in mine the blog owner may well delete the retraction.. . Lastly.  If it's a personal issue and a case of saying something you thought may have caused a problem in the first place, then you learned a lesson.  Think before you respond because there is no opt-out (I'm *not* saying that is your situation because I don't know what it is.). . Something tells me you said something you regret in how you put the question over.  If you didn't regret it and it was harmless, then in time it will go away ... end of.. . ~F~You can't ... Only the person who own the page can delete a blog comment. Only thing you can do is post a retraction on that same blog .

Oh don't forget the "i don't know" and "duh". . I think it's because they all bumped heads and their braincells fell out. Yes to sharky and the deformed gut.whats up dude ..you love me or what lol..... nasty1. People are point whores who're just looking to up their total.. 2. Who the hell is Sharky?there are no doubt alot of young people on this, need i say more..Yeah what he said :o).I don't know the well thought out question!LOL...My Goodness...Now----this---is why I keep coming back. You neaaaver know what an anonymous person will write.  Forget the points, if u want a goooood laugh, keep coming back. It works.  I will add this one to my 'watch list'.get over itOh Get a life!. . Sorry but it was only a matter of time before some one said itFair enough, but it has to be acknowledged that as well as people who give stupid answers there are people who ask stupid questions. Each question should get the answer it deserves, whatever type of answer that may be. There are people on here who do need to get a life. You described such people in you question."well thought out questions?". . would i have to buy myself a father's day present?. if i joined some weird religious bunch that allowed inter-family marrages and i married my mum, would i have to buy myself a father's day present? . . That's one of your questions. . . I don't call that well-thought-out, I call that weird. . . Another one was something like, Should I use superglue on my toes?. You wanted to use superglue to "stick your toes back on" after they had got "cut off." . That's BS. . . Doesn't sound well-thought-out to me. Again, sounds weird, and probably some sort of sick joke. . . I just find it really amusing that you expect "well-thought-out answers" when your questions are ... really just one big joke. . . The joke is on you.Give me a well thought out question and then I will decide.Pul-lease, num nuts, get a life.
I don't know how you do it, just ignore this section if you don't want to use it though.  I think that you just have access to it as part of the yahoo account.I'm not sure that you can delete your account, although I could be(and probably am) wrong.  I don't think that you would need to delete the entire account though.  Just don't log into Yahoo!Answers anymore and only use the address for your personal e-mails.  It shouldn't be a problem.  Or, you could simply open a brand new Yahoo! Account.  That would work.I don't Think You Can
You use points to ask questions. It costs 5 points to ask a question.I am guessing just a way to make a game out of helping people.. . All I can say is I hope people don't get so wrapped up in the points that they lose sight of what this website's all about:. . HELPING one another with answers to legitimate questions!for nothingyeah i dont like them... i just answer to be nice and help people, not to earn 'points'.personal satisfaction and to know how helping person ur when it comes to computersToo get more points than anyone elseyou can order a catalog and trade them in for things. I've already gotten a pool cue and a pack of juicy fruit. ten more points and I get a vacation house in the south of France.Check...IT's made very clever. With every point you gain you are supposed to feel just better and to increase your self-estime..Luck!nothing serious - juz a little friendly scoreboard for those who are watching.....
well, if it  has 2 do with a cell phone that means that u have not used it with in the months you were supposed to.like say for instance u have a library membership. if you don't rent books for like a good 2 months they deactivate your accountTry the link below:Well! most posible your lack of usage pront and automatic delition of you acount. solution, contact custumer service.From the main index page for the Yahoo!

You can't use it ever again & you cannot get it back. You have to create another one.
open messenger and they should pop up, and if you are archiving then they will appear there, This is assuming that I understood your question. . .You cannot check offline messages in yahoo messenger. In case, if u have any offline messages it will appear as soon as you sign into Yahoo Messenger. All the offline messages get deleted after you close the window. There is no way you can save them. But there is one option, if you remember from whom you received the offline message, you can go back to the archives of that particular friend and read it again. Again, for that also you will have to go to preferences and make sure to click on the option to save all my message archives. I hope that helps.if u setup the archives u can read ur offline messages. . to setup:. click messenger >> preferences >> Archive. click the button "Yes, save all my messages". click apply & ok. . to read:. click contacts. click Message Archive. . Goodluck ^_^offline messages pop up as soon as you sign into your messenger.i don't know

But you have to use your time for your good.. . . --- LeeeNit's not wastingFirsty, you are being a tiny bit hypocritical by asking a question about wasting time asking questions.  . Secondly, ( in answer to your question) why do people spend time on myspace and other websites like that?. It is to meet people and just see what other people from other countries are like, to share opinions and just have fun, it is not a waste of time but a lot of fun, hleping other people and seeing other ideasAsk yourself.. Why are you asking questions?But I'm in the Matrix, so this is the real worldcoz they have wasted more time n life finding the answers for the same!i am at work and board so i anwser only the dumbest peoples questionsJoin the club!  Or maybe it's 'I wouldn't be a member of a club the would have me as a member?'   Welcome.Because we are all sad morons and we are escaping reality. Most will probably disagree with that but if you go see an analyst i think you will find i am right.if you don't know why -why you here !I'm just on here 4 the points.Why are you here then? Sorry I asked you another question Oops!!ask yourselfMaybe...but your on here....You are not a sufferer of any disease.  Ask the persons who have benefited by getting meaningful answers from Yahoo! answers.  Real world will never listen to your answers.

This is my real picture and that's my friend Candy. I wish some people wouldn't use their real pics. Not you of course. Yours is very nice.come on, avatars are fun . Moreover, how do i know that u hv used ur own pic?Why would I want to post my real picture on the internet with so many perverts..... you got to be kidding!because I don't want to.  I don't come on here to be judged by how I look, this site is already becoming a dating site the more I read,  and I like my anonymity.  Plus sometimes peoples photos are more scary than the avatars in my opinioni think avatrs are a funny way to show urself to people...:). and it also may be the case with some people who are too shy to just expose themselves to lots and lots of people.... and another reason is that an avatar somehow keeps ur privacy..i also have my picture on messenger, but on answers i only display my avatar because i think it is safer. p.s. : and avatars don't have red eyes! :p ;)Why don't you learn how you use proper english when asking a question and stop worrying about picturesbecause I am electronically challenged and I don't know how. Besides you may go blind if you seen me just waking up!!!Because some of them give such moronic answers that they want to be anonymous.cause i dont have any pictures of me and i can change my avatar with my moodIt's supposed to be an anonymous forum.  If we all used our real names and pictures, we would be less inclined to say what we do on here.  For some, that would be a good thing in my opinion, lol!  But for me, it enables me to be more honest and say what I really think - no holds barred!My avatar looks better than a real life picture of me.because they all went to grammar school.I don't know how to put my photo on answers.I don't want my customers identifying me as an irreverent comedian!. I bet smileys really bugger you.. {:^). . Why does your smile look so cartoony?
You have to wait until the 14-day expiration...then the check box will appear for you to delete it. You will also have to send a new invitation to the correct address...as there is no way to correct the one already sent :)You cannot delete an invititation during the first 14 days (until it is an 'outstanding' invite.  To learn how to delete an invite after 14 days, go to the help page titled "How do I delete an expired invitation?" located at http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/360/friends/friends-11.html. . . Now, if a person has 'accepted' your invite and you no longer want that person as a connection, there is a help page titled "How do I remove a friend as a connection?" located at http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/360/friends/friends-05.html.sorry you can'twait for 14 days, then go to the invitation and you will see a red statment showing that it is expired. then click on the button and delete.I had the same problem and it wouldn't let me delete it until a certain time period. I think it was almost over 30 days and then I could delete because I didn't have any response.. Sorry I am not much help. Hope someone can help better.If you dont want to wait the 14 days you can put the ID of the person that you sent it to on ignore (I'm not sure how desperate you are to make sure the person you sent it to doesn't bother you)  After 14 Days ... Delete it.. . ~F~Exactly what Dennis said,  Good job Dennisi don't know i have been trying too do that

Becasue people are trying to look really clever by being negative because they think it gives them some kind of cred on the smart answer scale.. Which, by the way, it doesn't.most of mine are positive.. so i don't know.cuz sum people dont like other peoples opions, so y do people even answer!because more people are arrogantThat is the most stupid question in all questions!  How dare you state that MY answers are negative!  It is not like I feel you pinched a nerve or anything!  I mean, I might just think you are callous to my sensitive nature.  I mean, clearly because you believe what you do means you believe a whole list of stuff that you never mentioned in this questions.  It offends my very nature that you would even write the words to such a question.  And to that, Sir, I say, "Nee!"It is not every answer to be positive.! Can you tell why?Maybe you are asking the wrong questions...Some time the negative answers may be the right answer, but people just want to have fun by answering negative, not deliberate..because they're fun 2 write. :)Because a vast majority of people have terrible outlooks on life and are trying to drag the rest of us down with them.  Best wishesBecuase of stupid questions like this.its more fun to be mean!!!It has everything to do with the question.  Let's face it, there are some pretty silly questions out there.  I guess it angers people and they respond accordingly.Because unfotunately the majority of people dwell on the negative instead of the positive.When my answers are negative, I say them because:. . A) Its spam. B) THEY ARE ULTRA MUTURE AND I WANT TO BE LIKE THEM WHEN I GROW UP, SINCE THEY TALK IN CAPS LOCK!!. C) They break an obvious rule.. D) They Cant figure out a simple thing (Ex: When will earth explode?). E) Any combination of the above. . I more do this since I hate that there are so many people not even posting real questions on the site.  It gets REALLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLY annoying surfing through spam to find a real question.  Which, Like others there, I post negative answers.Because for some, it's easier than being nice. I always try to answer nicely,it costs nothing now does it? : )couse now days most of the people are negative.negative questions will receive negative answers.Negative and weird questions will always get negative and nasty answers. You grow what you sow.people don't wanna think before they answer n thus,give silly answersMost of the people that ask stupid questions and answers is because they are childish, and immature but hopefully the petition to have seperate answer forums one for the kiddies and one for the adultsa will help but who knows.bcz there r lot of aggressive ppl out here.. and some is just tried to get fun.. i think it is ok to get  negatives An-sr, some time it felt like a joke to me.because when you're anonymous , you feel free to say whatever you feel like. So go fuckoffTo balance the QuestionPeople like to be sarcasticthat depens on what questions your focusing on like the easy bake oven question that isn't a matter of negative it's a matter of what color it was.  no negative there.Because of stupid questions or racists.cause ppl don't need to be nice in hereStupid questions, and mean people.. . I really hate the bible thumpers on this website who try to push their damn religion on everyone...................Cause peoples take them as fun.We're all a bunch of "grumps" !!!
Your current score is 143 but you still need 107 points to reach level 2, because for level 2 users the starting points are 250 and it ends at 999 points.. Try answering more and asking less, use your daily limits of voting and rating and you will soon reach level 2.. Try to give quality answers to increase your chances of getting a best answer, if your answer is selected as the best, you will automatically get 10 points and increase your total score, not to mention the thumbs up.250 are needed too get to level 2.That's how it isit means you need 107 points on top of the 143 you already have, for 250 total points.
I think the best is Yahoo Toolbar, you can get it at . . http://toolbar.yahoo.com/. . This is with anti-spy and pop up blocker. Works fine for me.. . Also to stop Bulk Mail, edit your email settings.You're lucky... i get thousands in my bulk mail everyday.... The best thing to do i think would to be put the senders on you blacklist or blocked list.get popup blockerThe answer to the first is Popup blockers. To the second you really can't. Sometimes it all depends on where you go and what you signed up for. This would create a lot of spam if you do not read the fine print.. . Also it depends on who your e-mail provider is. Some as part of you using them send unwanted emails to you.. . My first internet account with email address was that way. Forgot about those email blockers and such. So part of this answer can be ignored.click on the e-mails and usually it says if you do not wnat to keep getting these mails or something then send a blank message back to the e-mail it came from.to stop pop-ups, download any search engine toolbar, i used2 have about 5 popups evry site i visted, to stop junk e-mails put them on the "block" or "blacklist"! it worked 4 me! :-) good luck!

There are some places that employ children like paper routes, but, that is becoming something of a thing of the past. Otherwise, there are child labor laws in effect in every state of the union that prohibit children being employed. Still, we hear of isolated incidences where "sweat shops" have been raided and children we're found working for pennies and being held against their will.  There are some cultures around the world which think nothing of a child working. It is commonplace. They work to help  support the family. That mostly happens when the family is not financially capable of sending their child/children to school. Not ever child on the face of this planet has the privilege to have a typical childhood as many of us have.  You can help by supporting global organizations whose main objective is to aid those uneducated/impoverished families to allow their children, the next generation a chance to overcome.Move to MalaysiaSorry, you aren't old enoughWork in a sweatshop.. Assuming you're the 9 year old, you're too young.. There are laws against child labor.be a paperboyYou can offer to do chores for your neighbors! When my son was 6 yrs old,During spring break, he secretly had gone to several neighbors and asked if he could pull weeds out of their flower garden and he asked if they had any other jobs for a "lil kid" He actually was hired by 4 different neighbors.He got up every morning and ate his breakfast and out the door he'd go when I asked where he was off to he just said to play with friends.At the end of the week he walked in the door with a big smile and carrying 1 dozen roses for his mom.My neighbors had told me they were paying him to pull weeds and a few chores but I wasn't to let him know that I knew.But I had no idea he was working so hard to buy flowers for my mother's day.The neighbors were so impressed with the work he did "for his age" they asked him to work all summer! I have always said"if a person really wants to work,there is a job for them" Good luck!Yard work, walking dogs, taking care of pets while their owners are on vacation, reading to older people who can't see well anymore, helping care for small children (while their mom is busy somewhere else in the house).....that's all I can think of at the moment.  Good luck!Do work like chores for your family. The only real job you can do as a child is work at a family owned business. If you have relatives who own a restuarant, store, etc. you can work there with their permission a few hours a week.You are not old enough. Here is site you can visit and make some money, its free. Give it a try.. . http://www.surfjunky.com/?r=james950you can't, at least not in a public business. State and Federal laws prohibit minors from working.Maybe a newspaper route or mowing grass.offer to do odd jobs for people in the neighbourhood, for exaple washing their car, walking their dog, tidying their garden?you can't get a paper job,ur'e not old enough. You have to be 13 for any one to set you on, ask neighbours or relatives if you can do a paid job for them, like washing their car or doing their garden.
If you are using that kind of horrible language in a question, no wonder you were reported.  This is an English-speaking country; we don't appreciate "slang".  You need to grow up, little girl, and start becoming a woman.ive been reported twice n i havent done ne thing i just answer questions to my fulliest ability i think people r on here just to report people dont worry bout it . have a great daydon't worry about it, let it out of your systemThat person had way too much time on his/her hands.did you say anything other than that?...maybe the person was just bored and wanted to bug youNot sure about your first question, but I'm sure your second question will get your reported. People just cruise through here finding things to report, instead of answer questions!maybe because of your mouth (swearing like a trucker)i'm sorry that happened...what a jerk.  what did they report you for?Stupid ......
Hi, I don't know why anybody would want to ask ridiculous questions if they will lose points for it. Unless some people just want to hear others opinions.I have tried searches, and sometimes, it does not give me the answer I seek. So I ask here.Because asking is easier than searching? How about you? Why are you asking this kind of question?
search instant messaging on yahoo . and itll say . Yahoo!IM and click. then installsign in to yahoo messenger,if u don't have it you get it on yahoo home page. and install from yahoo
When IM appears, click on ignore and check the box on the next pop up, click ok. It will block the sender.Okay, when you open your Yahoo IM go under the "Messenger" tab and click "Preferences"; from here go to the "Ignore List" now you can add any IDs you wish to block...in fact they give you two choices (1) ignore anyone who is not on your buddy/messenger list, preapproved ~OR~ (2) you can add people one at a time as needed, kind of like you do for junk mail on your email program.. Good Luck!This question is in the Yahoo! Messenger help pages:. . Q: How do I ignore someone?. . A: When you ignore a contact, you always appear offline to the contact. They cannot view your status or send you an IM.. . You must delete the contact from your Messenger List in order to ignore them.. . To ignore a contact:. . Click the "Messenger" menu in Yahoo!

MESSENGER --> PREFERENCES --> IGNORE LIST --> Then add the IM address of the person you want to blockThe first answer is rightor, easier....the next time they IM you.....just hit ignore in the upper right hand corner of the box......he'll go bye bye foreverClick the Messenger tab at the top and the click Privacy Options then click on Ignore list and then add the person you want to block to it.
I DONT KNOW BUT IT PROBABLY TAKES AT LEAST A DAY OR MORE IT DEPENDS ON HOW MANY COMPLAIN I THINK... ASK YAMSTER ..   . I WOULDNT GIVE OUT MY NUMBER TO ANYONE IF I DID I WOULDNT GIVE A LEGIT NUMBER... BUT THEN AGAIN I WOULDNT GIVE OUT MY NUMBER I AM NOT NAIVE I AM A 27 YEAR OLD I WILL BE 28 YEARS OLD JULY 3RD SO I AM DOUBLE PLUS HER AGE...In my experience, it seems that a priority has been placed on removing abusive and malicious content while miscategorized questions, while annoying, is not harmful or distasteful.  I feel it is understandable that miscategorization of questions and moving them to the rightful place takes a backburner to much more pressing content issues.no i havent sorry i cant help. have a great dayI think they have enough going on with legitimate abuse reports and silly reports to mess around with miscategorizing.. . I agree it is annoying though.. . Once I put on a silly question and after only 8 seconds they booted it off, said it was;t a question, and that same hour a question with someones personal address and phone was on the trying a arrange a hit on someone else.. . I just figure it is good life practice at "letting things go."
Please follow this path. Tools> internet options > content> auto complete> clear forms. To stop the genereation of history in yahoo search bar, uncheck the box of forms. It will solve ur yahoo search bar problem.go to CONTROL PANEL and than INTERNET OPTIONS and than got o CONTENT tab and theer u will see AUTO COMPLETE clcik it and now u will b seeinga  link CLEAR FORMS, click it and thats all, now close all these prioperties, ur seacrhs have been deleted
Thank you for responding to my question in a non-violent way. Also, I don't know how long resolved questions stay on here,but they should get rid of them when ten people have responded!Just wanted to tell you that you have a very beautiful/pretty avator.Until it's picked as best answerFor 2 seconds.
That is a question for the yahoo people. I would check the  site guidelines if i were you.Peace.beat the she-it out of me :)
I really don't think that's very safe, is it?  Shouldn't you toggle all your passwords to different things?I would also like to know this.
To change your nickname, go to the 'Messenger' drop down field and select 'My Contact Details'.  Add the nickname that you want in the 'Nickname' field, then click 'Save and Close'.Go to Preferences, then Appearance.  At the bottom, click on yahoo id, instead of Nickname, or First and Last Name.
Hanes seamless, tagless cotton boxer briefs. It'slike wearing silkbeing nude is the bestDepends on you. I perfer boxers.i prefer a nice silk and spandex blended boxer shorts..of course the quality ones are found at macys and nordstroms stores. going commando would be a viable option-in the hot summertimei'm not a guy either, but i would recommend hanes. first, they don't have no tag so you dont have the thing in your ass scratchin you. then they are cotton so they are comfortablethe cheap like i got on right now. calvinklein are the bestCotton knit boxers. It doesn't get any better than that. After a childhood of restricting briefs, cotton knit boxers was the first positive experience my groin ever had.I'm not a guy, but I would have to guess boxers.  I would assume more freedom.man thongsI don't wear underware.  I like flopping around and occasionally embarassing someone when I sit down and a nut slides out my shorts.  Of course, an erection in public can be quite a conversation starter as well.Well, before you go and buy underwear, you should probably look into where to find a brain.Go Commando (no underware). Underware are part of a conspirecy to control male genitalia
It was just a temporary glitch. That happens when they have trouble accessing the user pictures, but it looks like it's working again fine now.could be an internal glitch.. i dont see that here..mine doesent mine looks like jj redick i thinkI think that if we could just add facial hair and the colors gray and white or a grayish color to the facial hair and hair, then people could look older in their avatars instead of looking like a bunch of teenagers.I don't think so.. You don't look, "gray blockhead" to me:-).
C++ is important since it is one of the, if not the most flexible language.  It allows a programmer to use libraries written in most any other language, write or extend libraries including inline assembly language functions, and still have the ability to write fully object oriented code that deals with composition, inheritance and polymorhism.  The C language has been in use longer without the object oriented features, but C++ can and often does make use of any existing code base in C, since C++ is a superset of C.  C++ can also create object oriented interface wrappers for C code to update existing code easily into the new paradigm.  I hope this helps you out.c++ is object oriented programming which provided u with the concept of polymorphism, encapsulation and inheritence.. these are not provided in c language. and i suggest u to surf the net which will explain u the importance of c++.
Also, you may have another program installed that conflicts with Messenger like a skinning enging (Window Blinds) or something else like that. Try disabling the other software and see if that fixes it.Have you tried uninstalling it and re-installing it.  You may have a corrupt file....or you could have a program conflict.  I am assuming that you have already tried rebooting you computer.
they do it when they don't agree with your opinion or thoughts they can't handle that i don't know how to find out who did it they are just immature don't worry about it.  you had a point they didn't likeThe neocons abuse this feature.. I never use explicits when i discuss the "time" I spend with the wives of republicans.  I am just trying to find out more about why I do the sinful acts with these women and why I feel no guilt.. . The Neocons will report you anytime you put down JC, the baptist church, the south, USA, GW Bush, the fact that they are shoddy in bed, the clansmen, SUVs, NRA, etc.... . Try losing 7 points for an honest question without explicit or suggestive language just because they do not like what you are doing with their women.  It stinks because I am only helping the women express themselves sexually.  Bringing them to the realization that it is not them who aren't good in bed, it's the prudish husbands.Here are the community guidelines. If you received a violation notice, it's for something listed on this page.. http://answers.yahoo.com/info/community_guidelines.php. . Abuse reports are completely anonymous so you can't find out if someone reported you. If your posts are removed, that doesn't necessarily mean that someone reported you, though. There are staff who patrol the site to keep it clean so they may have removed it on their own.. . Sometimes people do report abuse just because they don't like your answer or some other grudge, but the staff reviews them so they won't remove it if it's not actually in violation of any of the guidelines.They may disagree with your statement or they think you broke a rule.because of rule violations, and there is no way you will find out.som @sshole. anyways if somebody does u'll get an email from cunstomer care and u'll lose 2 points per answer.Bcoz they think I'm rude.. But I'm just stating the facts.. haiz... so-called 'freedom of speech'.. bleah! hmmm.. i dun tink teres any way we can find out who did it.. can we?

The Yahoo! Answers team preferred a format that will display the same regardless of their monitor size and a fixed layout was the perfect way to go for this.

No way!!!Its probably Trillian. It combines all your messengers into one.Yahoo! does not offer the ability for us to know what version of Yahoo! Messenger our friends/contacts have.  You would have to ask if you want to know.If you trust him, ASk himit shows on the IM screen whether the person is using an old version or not

Would you like a copy of . . your bank account number posted on the internet ?  It can be arranged !. . The point is not to be too afraid, but to be responsible.

message the messagerthrow away your computer, and buy another.I'm not sure why it does that, but when I've had problems with Yahoo! Messenger I've just downloaded it again, which seems to work.. . HTH.
Click on the question...in the top right hand corner it should say DELETE. Click delete.click on my Q&A and deleteonce thet are resolved you cannot delete themIf they are still open then look on the right side of the question, but if they are resolved then they can't be deleted.Dumpling is right, once resolved you cannot delete them.  But, if they have not been resolved, you can opt to delete them or Yahoo will delete them for you in a certain amount of time.
I don't know what you mean by stepping on you.  I am assuming by running over you.  . Don't be a mouse, be a lion.. Strength, courage and confidence will help.. Stay away from those kind of people.I'd get up off the floor.kill them with careGet up off of the floor, dummy.Stand up for yourself!. If someone says or doesn't something to hurt you cuss them out or knock the crap out of them!. ?move out of the wayjump over them.....smiles"there's never been a better time than right now to get up outta the dirt"im assuming that you mean taking advantage of you, i used to let ppl do the same thing to me...i eventually got to the point where i got sick of it and put my foot down....sometimes now ppl think im being a jerk b/c of it but its better than being trampled on the rest of your lifeAlways be upright.. . what exactly do you mean stepping? When I think of stepping I think of $.By speaking up for yourself.  I am basically a nice person and a sensitive one and don't like to raise my voice much.  But I have learned that unless you give people some boundaries by looking in the eye and letting them know they've gone too far and you let them see the anger in your eyes and in your expression - they will continue to step on you.  Once they see you are not a pushover they will hesitate before crossing the line and if they cross it again, give them another blast of that "Don't eff with me" look and they'll get the message.Your back hurts? Kidding.  I'm assuming you mean that you feel like a doormat.  It's okay to help others out, but are you continuing to keep the same people out and they aren't helping you out at all? If so, then you're most likely being "stepped on". Friendships are a 2 way street, not one sided.?wear a spiked cow boy boots..

Do you remember part or all of their name? If so click on add contact and put their name in then click finish and that should add that person to your friends list. If not wait for them to get on and ask why you don't talk to them anymore or if you have a mutual friend contact that friend and see if they will give you your other friends name that you accidentally deleted.Try going back by pressing the back button or try undo. but if neither works you might have to re-add that person.If you activated message archive before, it will help. Open Message Archive and look through all the ID, you would see the deleted one again.On the yahoo messenger window click the address book tab and look for there name in there right click on it select send a instant message and one it opens click the add button.
At the top of this page, look at your user name, under it, it says "my account", clik it, go to that page and select the username you want to edit/delete. Clik "Delete". if you want to completely remove yourself from Yahoo entirely, just delete all usernames.are you insane?  don't do that!good rate?????????????going back to your account and change your id its that simple...look go to your papers when u first got your id then change it there...........or if that doesnt work get a new account
People do that because they get a kick out of it. They think it's the funniest thing to do and have nothing better to do.I truly believe that some people just don't care about other peoples feelings.think most are just crying for attention-i try to blow them off and not respond just seems to encourage them-keep the peace old hippieBecause in an open forum theres always going to be some jackasses that want attention
That is one of the oldest and most common scams. . Did you send any money?report the entire email including who sent it to you to yahoo. Then after you have done that mark it as spam so it cannot be sent to you again.this is an old scam, and has been floating around via email & fax for about 10 years.. . Hit the "report" button.use the report button and it will be emailed to yahoo. . dont be slow or some bugger will be caught out big timeThis is fishy, and take no part in it. You will regret later. Tick the box and select scam.If it is on Yahoo, that you have received this the best thing you can do is report this user to the appropriate authorities if you got it on yahoo, then report it to them if it came from a AOL site, then report to AOL and so on im sure you get the idea, if you are having issues after that contact your local police authority and ask them the best course of action, good luck, just whatever you do, do not give them details about yourself, as in name, age, date of birth or anything to do with your bank accounts, as once they have them you will be in serious trouble.
Go to your "My Page" in 360 (or click the link below).  Find the box below your profile photo that says "Visitor Stats", and click on the "Public" link.  That's it!Log on to yahoo 360 and click on settings. Now u can change ur account settings. [use "can be change by" dropdown menu for set  ur privacy settings]
It is a very good suggestion.  I for one am tired of the useless,  goof off questions clogging up the works so you can't get at the good questions.. I understand that there are too many to regulate, it is just that this is a good suggestion, hypothetically.there is far too much information for yahoo to regulate it that much people just have to ignore the crapi agree, this could be the start of something great!Then you would complain about the people getting points for really good questions and your not getting any.don't you lose 2 points every time you ask a question? why would people waste that asking stupid things.Exactly... A way for people to rate questions from 1-10 would help.I'm in favor of that idea.  I'm also tired of the stupid questions and people who put things up that have no business being here.  If you want to chat smut, there are plenty of other sites around!
Its a Profile page wher you can see your friends and your friends network, . .

That is such an intresting question, wow you are so amazing and funny and talented and unbelievably FUCKING SEXY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!You can have numbers in your ID but it's not case sensitive. e.g myAccount@yahoo.com and MYaccount@yahoo.com is the same.Edit: I mean  Numbers capital letters and ........................A yahoo ID is not case sensitive.   Therefore, if your Yahoo! ID is test@, someone can send an email to test@yahoo.com or TEST@yahoo.com and you will receive the email.  A Yahoo! ID may consist of a-z, 0-9, underscores, and a single dot (.)
Do you mean translate the text? If this is what you are asking, simply go to www.bablefish.com and translate it...very simple, just click a button.First you need a browser and email service that allows Thai.  Most do but I know that SBC browser does not.. Then you either have to install Thai fonts on your computer or go to virtual Thai keyboard then cut and paste it to your email program.. It is easy to install Thai fonts on XP.. Choke deewrite whatever you want to microsoft word and copy it
Well, you can't push and you certainly can't stalk.  Best thing is to just occasionally run into him--be where he is.  If you won't be intruding on anything, like a date he's already on and the opportunity presents itself, just open the lines of communication by saying hi to him.  Just an unobtrusive conversation and let things go the way they will.  Don't mention that you want to get back with him.  Be open and make yourself approachable.  If he's still interested in you, you'll gravitate back together.  If he's not, it's time to move on.Wellllll, don't play games. Don't have your friends do calling for you. Call him, ask him if he would meet you for coffee or sodas somewhere private. NOT where your friends hang out. Tell him that you are just learning about your heart, that you were feeling more serious about him and your relationship than you knew how to understand when you broke up with him. You were young and scared, and you reacted badly. You understand what you were feeling now, and it isn't scary at all. You feel very strong emotions around your boyfriend, and you hope that he will consent to hang out with you again. Tell him that you have grown up a lot in your heart and in your mind during the time that you have been apart, and you know what you want, now. Then, it's up to him. Good luck!IF THIS GUY IS REALLY IMPORTANT TO U THEN U SHOULD APPROACH HIM URSELF EXPLAIN TO HIM WHY U BROKE UP WITH HIM TO START WITH HES PROBABLY HURTING AND IS CONFUSED ACT NOW GIRL B4 ITS TOO LATEDon't bother.  You obviously broke up with him for a reason.Since you are the one who broke up, I believe u should patch up with him. Perhaps, he too wants to make up with u but is still probably holding back cos it was u who broke up with him. If u don't make the first move, then he might think that u never cared for him & that u are a self centred girl. I am a guy too & I am just saying all this by placing myself in his shoes. Its up to u now. Gud Luck !
If you have enabled archiving, then you have a file on your computer that will have all your previous conversations including offline messages that you may have deleted.

1, Use all kinds of torture to force the password out of that person.. 2. Download softwares that tracks down IP and then steal the Password by repetitive matching.. 3.

It is not possible to recover lost emails once they have been deleted from your trash folder.  :(If they aren't in your email,I don't think you can recover them!..  You might try uninstalling messenger then download and install a fresh messenger .If you decide to do this,go to control panel and find yahoo messenger and remove it.then close control; panel.Then go to windows explorer and click on "Programs" then find the yahoo file  right click and delete it. Then go download yahoo messenger and reinstall it! that possibly will correct  your problem!
If you don´t like the colour maybe u should change your profile settings and select another colour that you really like instead - how about that ???you should fix your pc properties and settings.because they arent blue..  dont know, maybe originator has peter pan fetish?I think it's a nice colour scheme...green is a neutral colour that's probably why they chose it.Good call, can we change them ourselves or is it the page, contact yahoo to make an option to change the couler, I fancy a nice Rangers/royal blue.
For the same reason a dog licks himself.... . They CAN.maybe we're just smart people that know everything. So we only ask the smart questions.Because they have nothing better to do and some of them do it for attention."Stupidist" isn't a word. . .they are borad and have nothing to doDid you mean to ask, "Why do people ask the MOST STUPID questions on here?"  The more intelligent people would know that "stupidist" isn't a word.  Sorry to sound sarcastic, but you did take the time to write a question for the sole purpose of being cynical.  Seems kind of spiteful, that's all.they just want to get your attentionFor the same reason that most people are on here...to kill time...they ask the questions that come to their minds at the moment...I have been known to ask what some people might call stupid questions too.....I am at work right now...with like 45 min's to go....& bored....it is just for fun...although some people ask some really thought provoking questions....or have legitimate questions.....I answer all that grabs my attention....to earn the pointsBecause they can. I think some just have nothing better to askBecause they think this is: Yahoo for DUMMIESBecuase you did that toohow are we going know unless we ask , they may seem dumb to you , but to us they maybe things we honestly need answers to....do you know everything , I think NO ......so let us find answers and if you don't like it stop coming to this siteAnd this question is more relevant in some way?. . . People come on here to kill time & either ask stupid questions or give stupid answers.So why did you ask this "stupidist" question?FOR THE FIRST TIME......A QUESTION JUST FOR ME.....AND I HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO ANSWER.........LOLThere are no stupid questions.coz they wanna see if there are even more stupid people who will reply their stupid qn and guess wat.........ppl flock with their answers to prove them right!!Because all ages and IQs are allowed to ask questions.It's annoying, isn't it?  And why do they ask questions that have been asked hundreds ....... no! thousands of times before!! . Llike this one (or similar) has been asked 162 times before.  But here I am, answering it!  oh well.  Whatcha gonna do?they're not stupid questions!! i genuinely want to know if she loves me!!!! and i really believe that a bunch of complete strangers who dont even know what i look like will be able to tell me!!
Someone named Dana in Iowa brought them down. "She" is a TS. Be careful if you run into "her" and her creepy white van. She ruins all boards.Investigate senator Miller,In he die before,find out E.T. You are dog that makes one detest! E.T is shameless animal!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The E.T. is surveying the Saviour's thought! They attack him with the Saviour's personal secrets , they have hindered the Saviour from fulfilling one's own duty! They let the Saviour be unable to live! , What I should remind here is: The Saviour is God's envoy, at the same time is to the whole human injury too to the Saviour's injury! The fact is like this too, the alien behavior has guided mankind into very more grave disaster. What behavior is the alien one to cause the human disaster? The E.T. destroyed in the future the development process, behavior injuring the Saviour caused the human disaster. The development process in the future is the biological chain, a ring among them of destruction will cause the destruction of the whole biological chain , its result is calamitous. What I need to remind is here : Though can be predicted, can change in the future, like building the dam on the river, can hold water ; Dig a irrigation canals and ditches nearby, can pilot a ship into harbour . But God's behavior does not stylize, God is intelligent, God's ability exceeds your imagination, if you think your science and technology developed , can destroy this form , can do at will , the result caused , It will surely be disaster, and you will enter hell , suffer punishment. If you ask , now, how to then can show to God repent. then I can tell you , just Cut the E.T.s head ! Because they are really a group of shameless animals, a group of ungrateful animals! Only cut the head which puts them, could express your respect for god , could redeem your sin ! E.T will say so. After E.T gets back to their celestial body, their head asks them, what you have done on the earth? E.T will say so: "We and our ally - U.S.A. , China, find in a chatroom that there are individuals that are helping his friend to scold people, that person has been scolding all the time . Because the person that this person scolded involves the high-ranking official of China (though he does not know ), so we help ally China of us, offer assistance for attacking that person in Chinese Government, including offer his personal secrets , his whereabouts , does not allow that person to have the job. Though we know in advance that will do harm to American army to do it in this way. We delete the opinion which he issues, turn into our opinion. Turn his thought into our thought. Attack him , make him give up on the opinion that he plans to write (some are opinions of rescuing people). We have brought the honor and got back to this celestial body." I think this is E.T will be said. Can you ask me whether you plan how say to Allah perhaps? I will tell you , when I face Allah's trial , I will say to Allah so : "I have already warned them ' E.T has been shameless animals ', though under the interference of E.T and those corruptive governments, I have done one's best to help the mankind. " ???E.T,your forefather is parasites??? Why does E.T like eating SH1T? Because the forefather of E.T likes eating SH1T, this is called " the dog eats the SH1T , the instinct is difficult to change ". E.T,your forefather is shameless parasite!you is shameless parasite too!please rolls out the earth!here does not need you !you bring the mankind into the disaster!THERE IS A TROLL NAMED PETE SOMETHING OR OTHER..HE HAS 2,000 ID'S..HE IS USUALLY IN ON RUINING FUN FOR ALL THE OTHER LEGIT MESSAGE BOARD USUERS
No I don`t think so.  you can tell how many people looked at it, but not who, and not when. If it bothers you,just make your blog veiwable by those you want to see it, or you can make it veiwable only by you.No, unless they leave a commentonly if they have been added or accepted as a friend by you to your 360 page....otherwise they cannot just add themself.  look at your page and see if they are there....if so and you don't want them to be go to my friends and edit preferences for that person and delete them from your page.Yes you can have some idea of movement, but you can't tell exactly when someone is there.. . Add a counter to your blogs, and keep refreshing if your page stays open to see any movement.  Remember, a lot don't leave comments so you don't know who may be on your blog at any time ... a counter gives you some indication and it's free. . http://www.simplehitcounter.com/. . . ~F~

The word to which you refer is generally not acceptable because it was used as a derrogatory term for black people by those who enslaved them.  The school of thought is that using that word perpetuates the racial bias and ignorance started by the people who were using that word.because people can take offense to it, and y would u want to use it anyway?Because, it is a racist name that was given to black people, and you posting this question, is going to make some people very, very angry, I find your question in a racist form.racist-----and its a terrible thing!!!it may be a hateful slang, but why do black people use it when talking to other black people?!  yea you don't know the answer to that one!  i find it funny that black people are allowed to be racist against their own people but other races aren't allowed to use that word!So all of this time that I have been using "Person" I have been wrong....dam!!! Go figure...now get a life suckhole.R U Stupid!!!!!Because it was a hateful slang used to descibe afro americans during the days of slavery, but I do think its crazy that black people call each other niggers but white people can't say it

i don't know but if u find out tell me plz.  thanxYahoo! dosn't provide a service like that. I know there are softwares that do only that, but they will cost money. If you are interested serch Google text"Mail Notifier"Yahoo does not offer that option.  I am certain of that.  By the way, I've read somewhere that it is considered improper to try and find out when your recipient has read their email, etiquette-wise.  It would be neat though.there isn't no way the only way you would know is if the replyed to youWhat your asking is impossible.. Once you send email, it leaves your computer and travels along the Superhighway, that is the World Wide Web.  Once it arrives at it'd destination, it parks itself in the persons "address."  You know longer have ANY control or observation of that Email.. It's like, someone left your house and went home... how do you know when they pull in their garage?  You don't.  They have to call you and let you know they made it home!. Same thing... . Now, there ARE email services out there (like where you can send special occasion cards) that will notify you that your card was picked up (so, if you send someone a card, they will get email telling them to go pick it up from a special site... and once they go pick it up... THEN you will be notified that the person picked up your card).... . So, the answer to your question, as I'm sure others have typed by now, is No.
I would lik to use my yahoo ID & password.If you use Yahoo! Mail and Yahoo! Messenger, then both will use the same ID. That's what I'd recommend.preperably get a new account
yep, YAHOO is having problems.UPDATE:. . Last week, there were some intermittent login issues last that affected many of the Yahoo! Messenger users (and some Yahoo! Mail users). While it wasn’t an issue to login to Yahoo! Answers, as you can see that those affected by the login issue were able to come on here and ask questions, some Yahoo! sites/products were affected. This intermittent issue occured from June 20th - June 22nd.most of yahoo networks is having problem now.. don't worry, i still having problems with most of yahoo services, like IM and mail.well its been a problem since quite a few hours today.i think there is some problem with yahoo itself.lets see it might be rectified in a few hours or so.Don't worry. Yahoo is having problems with its servers...there is some problem with yahoo server..even i am not able to sign in
Page visitors indicates the number of different users who visited your blog.. Page viewers indicates the number of hits that viewed your blog.. Page visitors save the IP address of each user, so it won't get calculated even if the user view your site 1000 times, while if he visited your site again the Page view will increase each time he view it.I have no input here, so I'm glad you asked this question because I didn't know either.Correct! You've had 219 individuals visit your Blog and all together they looked at 2,343 pages!

Unfortunatly, you can't.  You would have to go in one at a time and copy each one.  Sorry.yahoo no longer archives the attachments in groups, but u can go to the group's site and read all the past messages.
I think it's because Yahoo (and hotmail) have a limit to the size of the file you can attach.Otherwise, the server thinks it is spam and rejects it. Try sending your music files one by one rather than as a group. It takes more time, I know, but at least they arrive at the destination.winzip it or winrar.... as simple as that
If you are looking for a particular conversation, right-click on the contacts name in your messenger list. You will see a menu with several options, then click on Message Archive. If you want to look at all of your archived messages, click on the contacts menu at the top of Messenger and select Message Archive. You may find that you need to reset your preferences to make sure that all future conversations are archived and not deleted.i think ur archive folder is jinxed. jk.. u better take care of the archive folder on ur pc. the reason might be that some of the files in the archive folder might have not been properly written. if u don't find a solution in my answer. try contacting yahoo user services. they usually have a solution to ur problems. but keep in mind. these people r hell time takers. so be patient and wait for their answersThere might be 50 folders but only 10 of them have archived conversations.  If that's not the case, ask Yahoo:. http://add.yahoo.com/fast/help/us/messenger/cgi_feedbackopen the yahoo messenger. then sign in. and then click the view button (just right of file button) here u will find the message archive.
Your question stays open for 7 days if you don't choose a best answer.  After that it will automatically go to a vote.. . Sometimes the asker cannot choose because there are too many good, similar answers--so they choose to let people vote on it.Sometimes...the person who asked the question never comes back to do anything with it, so after some time it will automatically be put to a vote.. . ISometimes the asker doesn't know what to pick. So they put it on vote. When you vote, you can vote for an answerer or you can choose "No Best Answer".to see which ones the best, even ifs the only question asked.i put it to the vote coz either way i get 3 points but the voters also get apointsometimes, the asker gets so many good answers he/she cannot choose which is best/or worse.

Follow this path. Start>  control panel> add remove> yahoo toolbar> Remove. U will get rid of ur yahoo toolbar.control panel, then add/remove programsGo to control panel then add/remove programsin firefox go to view>>toolbars>>uncheck yahooI think you can remove it by going to your control panel. I didn't like it either, and that's what I did to get rid of it.There is a tool on the yahoo toolbar that is a pencil with a small arrow next to it and if you click on that arrow it will give you options and one of those options is uninstall and that should be your answer!!!As others have noted, going to control panels and selecting add or remove programs will remove Toolbar completely.. . If you just don't want the toolbar to appear in IE but do want to keep it installed for use later, select View > Toolbars and uncheck Yahoo! Messenger.go to the control panel and add/remove programs and at the bottom of the list you will see Yahoo toolbar and you can safely remove it from there....
The same reasaon you do, or have to ask this question. I love to share advise with others, do sometimes get board. And with the poit system, it becomes a game to try a reach the next level. I selectt my questions and don't answer them allbored and addicted mostlyto get points. i dont know what they are for tho.70% Boredom. 15% Addiction. 15% AdviceI luv to give at vice and this has become an addiction. But most of the time I'm boredFor the points. DUH:P That is why I answered this question!!!!i don't know why do you like asking them?. i agree with the guy below meIts easy :)for the 2 pts.. See it worked,I answered a dumb question and got 2 points. ThanxI'm at work and bored. However, I try to ignore the really stupid ones.Freaking people out with my answers is not a waste of my time.. . There are some concepts I have achieved that are hard to communicate, and stupid questions allow me to practice my explanations and rhetoric.. . Bored?  Boredom is a very advanced state of meditation, i have a religious respect for it.. . Now, I do like giving advice, and I have some for YOU.  When you ask a question, don't poison the facts with value judgments welded into the question itslef ("waste your time" and "dumb").  The person with an original thought is much less likely to share it after being dissed.I don't find most of the questions on here stupid, some of them are from people that really need to know an answer, the most stupidest and ignorant questions are from those that really no meaning of a question, and or ask questions pertaining to personal body parts, (And, I've seen some graphic questions). lol.to waste time while I am at work. Boring job, real boring. But its over Friday. Wahoo.well its because I'm really dumb too so i answer them. Hey I answered yours. Must be a dumb question, Congratulations!! take a bow. yey. Hahahau just sent me an answer 2"how do i get my b-Friend 2 want me more"and u told me 2 get naked  heres something ya didn't know.............. I AM A 12 YEAR OLD VERSION AND THATS DIGESTINGSame reason you wasted your time asking itUsually I'm bored at work, and I like to see how many times I can type out Lesbian Nazi Hookers Abducted By Aliens And Forced Into A Weight Loss Program.POINTS!the last 2: I'm bored and I love 2 give adviceMy time is not your time. So therefore I will do with it as I choose.It's better than sitting twiddling my thumbs :)it is addicting. but then again i love to give out my serivices whenever i canI'm also @ work and bored. Why do you ask dumb questions if you don't want someone to respond to it?
theres nothing you can do but just keep clicking. yes, it is very annoyingYou're speaking of the advanced function at the top. and using filter.. If the language "English" ,(this must be English"  from any country), does not remain, have you tried "USA" questions only?  These should always be English,  I hope.  Not sure anynore.. There doesn't appear to be any permanent setting.i wish i knew.....isnt it annoying???????????????
Well, you can download the newest version & just check or uncheck the voice I believe. Someone correct me if I'm wrong. I'm not aware of any security issues on the old versions thoughYou don't need to worry about the name. The "with voice" tag is simply marketing to try to get people to realize they can do voice calls with Yahoo! Messenger to compete with other voice programs like Skype and Gizmo.. . Just install the latest version from http://messenger.yahoo.com If you don't want to use the voice features, then don't. Everything else still works as it did in previous versions, and there are new features and bug fixes too!. . If you really do want an older version before they introduced the "with voice" tag, go to http://www.oldversion.com/you can use the new version, just turn the sound off.  I just did it yesterday.i don;t think this will help u butt all i got to say is that i don't think u could without voice. becuz when i did it it said for me to download messenger with voice

Log onto Yahoo using your exsisting id and apply for a dot email id. On doing that you can have both the ids on the same account.You will have to get something like incredimail or outlook express.  You can actually have it configured to check two or maybe more email addresses at once....Try forwarding the email mesages to other email id. Most of the email services provide this facility. Try itWhat you can do (even if it is webmail) you can either configure one of two things.. . First, you have webmail or Outlook you can setup the respective POP servers and type in the necessary account information (i.e. username and password). Now, if you're using webmail, what you should do is access the e-mail account which you wish to have forwarded and look in the options for Message Forwarding. Once that has been completed it should foward to your new account.set up one e-mail to forward to the otherHave one email forwarded to the other.
You should change your password just in case someone else has it and is logging in as you. You can do that here:. http://edit.yahoo.com/config/eval_profileI have noticed this occurring when my wireless connection drops connection then reconnects.  I have also noticed this happening when my router is acting up as well.  It is not a password or account issue, it is an Internet connectivity issue.Everyone is having problems, it started last night, emails too.
there is no what to do it through yahoo mail, but you can do it through my yahoo I believe1 ) go to yahoo main page.. 2 ) find photos.   there your in your photos.
For Yahoo Messenger: Delete name from friends list....if you don't see the option pop up or check the box asking to delete from address book too?....do that manually......there is a tab there for address book right on your Messenger palette.. Go into preferences by clicking on "messenger" top left corner.Once in preferences look for Ignore list....2 options....choose anyone not on my friends list....this will block his pm you.Even though you delete him;your name is on his list and he can pm you.Chosing the above option will stop him from sending any instant messages. The next thing and last thing I post  is totally up to you.When chatting and you encounter him.....look in chatters box right click on his screen name choose ignore.This will only temporarily "ban" him....as you will not see what he is saying.For a more permanent solution;go back to ignore list in preferences....click on add.....fill in his screen name in the box.Look to bottom....click apply....then click ok.You will never see him again.. When all else fails use report abuse link located in chat palette in any room.just   say   leave   me    alone    i    need   my    space  okHow can I ban you?Delete him from your buddy list and block his screen name.wave your hands in the air. And SHOUT   begone  Satan!Sounds like puppy love to me.I'm not sure if "banning " someone is possible.but you can ignore them!stop being a wimp and deal with himBuy a little container of that Ban deodorant and rub under their arms when they're not looking...um i think u can just delet them and then send a restraining order thriugh there e-mail saying that u dont want to have anymore e-mails!

maybe they arent smart enough im sick of it also i asked one question had a sentence explaining everything[question was what do u think of peircings] details[other than ears]  and i get a question back On the ears???. . how stupid can some people be?Why, do you have something to hide?  You post a question for this, be aware this will happen!  For this is open to the public-- Perhaps, many are looking for the sincerity and validation of your questions and comments.  By the way, I refrained from reading all the 'details' of you questions.  Happy now?!What details?well I think your details only make sense to you and are intended to create trouble that is why people dont read them because they dont understand them like your threat of abuse. please see link below http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AoNtLuSKmm1PitOfzzFSDyDsy6IX?qid=1006051636399Perhaps because you posted no details on this question.. All you have is a blind link that could lead to anything including viruses and spyware.  Most of us practice computer safety and dont click on blind links.I do that some times.Maybe your questions are just too long OR some ppl like to post ignorant,stupid,or just plain unfunny answers because they have no life.I think people are anxious to be sarcastic or hateful or just get points and they don't really want to "answer" your question.  Good luck with it in the future.Probably because they are more interested in what they have to say than what someone else is asking. They've already got an answer to what they've read in the initial question and they don't want to be bothered with reading any more details that might side track them from the "wisdom" that they are itching to impart. That's why God tells his children...So then, my beloved brothers, let every man be quick to hear, slow to speak, slow to anger; for the wrath of man does not produce the righteousness of God.  James 1:19-20Because you are so concise in your first sentence, they can glean your very meaning through the little information that they see first. . . You are like the gawdfathah of question askers. . . You rock the casbah. That's why they so want to give you answers as soon as possible. You should be asking for money. . . !!!!!!Maybe it's because you're boring.Instead of whingeing, why don't you ask a question? What details are you talking about? Where are they?  Which question are you refering  to? You are far too imprecise to  be able to formulate an answer for you. Learn to communicate effectively. Jules, lecturer. Australia.I have read you whole question. Now what?
Good God, BobTheBizGuru is right! That's no ordinary member posting this question, it's freaking Einstein himself! He's come back!

I was wondering that myself because I answered your question with a very lengthy & good answer & put it on my watch list since it was getting so many answers... anyway, my advice was that  since he costs you $50 then you should cost him $50,  by say,  throwing nails under his tires if you see his car in a parking lot , then he'd not only be out of a pretty penny, he'd also  know firsthand what its like to be stranded, much like he did to you by leaving you to  take a cab... and also if thats not possible or just too mean for you,  you could copy a yearbook photo of him, or better still hopefully  you had prom pictures done before he started showing his azz that night ; take the pic, crop it to just his face, then post it online along with the horror story of your night with him ..or whatever else you feel like  the possibilities are endless~lol... I love revengeThats nothing Mine got deleted for typing PooPooI had a similar question on how to get back at a ex-boyfriend.. and they deleted it too...Don't feel bad...I'm sure that most of the questions you are referring to get deletedpeople sometimes have to be asswholes so they do it for "fun" and it ruins it for the person who needs help in this case it was u or it was a little kid using thier parents id lol and they thought it was grous and deleted it! 8)Just ask it again and make sure you don't break any of the precious rules.  there are rules nazis here... look out for then.maybe ur prom date turned u in!!!!. ps if it was the juniour prom dont worry about it but if it was the senior prom, get him for all hes got!!!!!!hmm im not sure but maybe the seekign revenge thing got to some people.  personally i hope you make him suffer....at least some sort of embarassment--nothing truly harmful or injurious but humiliation of some sort seems appropriateI think that it may have been because you wanted revenge - and the way you phrased the question in anger.. . I, too, have seen a lot of questions here which should be deleted immediately.Maybe they deleted it because it wasn't really a question, but you venting your displeasure.yea i know it has siad i violoated like 3 when thats nothing compared to other sick ones
You can't really delete a Messenger account, because you don't actually have a Messenger account. You have a Yahoo! account, which gives you access to free services like Messenger.

I think its because they have subliminal messages throughout this site. If anyone's noticed this, please let me know. :)have u seen whats on TV these days  nothing but rubbishcoz you can have your say without being interrupted!lol i find that 2....It's nice to help people. It makes you feel useful.Because most of us don't have a life :)because it takes care of bordem..Because you need a life.I dont know as I dont have time to think as I am too busy trying to answer questions!We get addicted to yahoo answers due to many reasons. We get knowledge, teaching, learning , fun, entertainment, current affairs, current attitudes of the people all over the world, current needs of the people current socioal changes and many more other things; all under one roof of yahoo answers. Moreover, the point system on this site gives recognition to the user's participation. So, all these make us addicted to this site and we are transformed into an answerholic.because people want to earn pointsCause most of us thinks we is wiser than a tree full of owls!When you find out let me know!  Its practically costing me my university degree, as I just can't pull myself away!I know...!its not addictive at all. . we are all on here of our own free will, and in complete control. . how dare you imply such a thing. . it's not a problem for me, i can stop anytime i want. . i know i can give it up if i want, cos i've given it up already hundreds of times beforeI have certainly tried to figure out that one myself.  I also think that I should be paid actual money for each question I answer.  However, Yahoo and their bright people know that they don't have to pay me in order for me to keep coming back and answering quesitons.  Sigh!
Check the squares in front of the emails and the click on spam. U will not receive emails from those senders again. Yahoo blocks such senders when u click on spam.Go to Yahoo Help and follow procedure to put the SPAM GUARD ON. and report SPAM mails and clear only approved friends mail to be received filtering the restTry using a software called bspam...  . . It realy works....which email id u are using? u can find an option somewhere in the page to block the mail sender. . check for the option to block spam.
Right next to your question on this page( on the right side), or on any of your other questions, there is a white box with a list of options.

Yeh, and I've noticed not many new questions being posted in the categories I visit. Hence I end up searching into other categories and responding to questions by answering why there aint no questions or answers.....Its because Yahoo Answers has to become so big, there are simply too many questions being asked to get answered.. . JamieIt's summer ;-)Because they are finally realizing that Yahoo! Answers is messing up their life.I think i have a theory, humour me.. . You've answered a question, it was a Adult sex yuk nasty question but we still answered it & then reported it!. Do we still get to keep the 2 points?. . Think they must have a backlog of spaff to sort out!well I was on the forum yesterday and from what i read it seems people are getting fed up and leaving, partly because of the nastiness that is apparent in many questions and/or answers.  it's sad, because the ones that leave are the ones that benefit the site and it leaves the others free to take overDont know I am trying to get them all. LOLEverybody is busy scratching their partsyespeople are all watching world cup?i had 2-graduations yesterday... i will try to catch up today.they are on a coffee break I rekon Late ? No one is Late They are always on time. It's u thats the late one.if you want questions answered than you answer them,because it is 754am where I am at and I should be getting ready for work instead of answering questions...oh ok 755am. justinciderIf you're wondering why people aren't answering your questions, I'd have to say that out of the 8 questions that you've asked,  about half of them are hard for most people to answer.  Therefore, you're not going to get a bunch of answers.  Your questions have to do with bangalore and visiting hyderabad, but I doubt that most people (especially people in the U.S.) have ever heard of either of these places.  Nor do we know much about indian railways and why they can't provide constant water supply in the toilets.. So is that what you're wondering?  Or are you wondering, in general why no one is answering questions?. If you want lots of answers to your own questions, I would simply suggest that you ask a little less "regional" questions and stick to the kilo, quotation, Atkins-type questions.  Good Luck.Hmmmmm, I wonder...oh my god, maybe people have lost interest!  Woe is me, what shall we do?Your question is one-sided. Haven't you observed that questions have become dumb of late?

This could be a problem with internet explorer or with yahoo, which could be solved by downloading the most recent patches for IE or the latest version of yahoo.. . Or, this could be a problem with spyware hiding on your computer.  I would suggest running a spyware scan with something like Spybot S&D as soon as possible to be sure.im not sure.. but you should download firefox. its a different kind of web browser like internet explorer, except its better. you probably wouldnt get those errors anymore.. . and the cool thing about firefox is, if you wanted to go a website, in the url bar, you dont have to type in the www. or the .com. . for example, if you wanted to go to yahoo on internet explorer, youd type:. www.yahoo.com. . in firefox, all you have to type is:. yahoo. . heres the link if youre interested :). . http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/It may not be Yahoo doing it. Go to Control panel and click on add remove programs. Find the Internet explorer that is in there. Click delete program, drop down will come up that says delete or repair click repair.. See if it still does the same thing once you have repaired it.. . If this does not fix it then try system restore and restore puter back to date you know it was doing ok.. . Just thought of something else you can try also lol. Go to the top of this page where it says tools click on it. find where it says manage add on's. Click on it and see if you need all the things you see there if not disable the ones you do not want or need.I really wish I could help you but, I am having about the same problem. I'm getting alot of errors on my computer. Alot of times I get one saying that YPage has caused an error. I don't know what to do about it. If you find out the cause and how to fix it would you please let me know. . I'm scared to download anything because I'm afraid it is going to crash my computer. Thank you so much.

Need more information....... . Question like "is blue possable" dont get answered properlycopy and paste or save picture as then just print!What do you mean?umm...wtf? where are the pictures? are they on the internet?

Because every time someone asks a stoopid question, God kills a puppy. Why do you hate puppies?! PUPPY KILLER!!!There are no stupid questions, only stupid answers.There's nothing wrong with stupid questioons, you just have to be prepared for stupid answers...Isn't that how the saying goes?nothing at all they give you points :). . thx btwWhat about stupid answers?I love silly questions, go on, go on! Give us another one!this isnt about your question... however. in a question u answered u said u used to breath really fast, stand u n hold ur breath... how long 4 each part did u do b4 passing out??there is no such thing as a stupid question. .   questions start people thinking. maybe there is a fresh     perspective to be heard.The only stupid question is the one you don't ask.I actually find that people answer my stupid questions, more then my serious ones... so whats the point in wasting points to get one question answer when you can get 20. So whoevers complaining get answering the serious ones so that people will ask them!. I"I love silly questions, go on, go on! Give us another one!". . THANKYOU!!!! YOU TRUELY ARE A FAN!Nothing as long as you don't insult people. Calm yourselfi dont call them stupid just fun

So then you just pull it out.thats why people say I gotta wedgie lemme pull it outa fatal sexually transmitted diseaseWell, it could be 2 things: a wedgie could be a type of sandwich often found in pizza places in the northeast or it is when your underwear ride up into your butt crack and you have to pull them out.1. A shoe having a wedge-shaped heel joined to a half sole so as to form a continuous undersurface. Often used in the plural.. 2. The condition of having one's clothing stuck between the buttocks, often from having had one's pants or underwear pulled up as a prank.WHEN I PULL YOUR UNDERWEAR UP YOUR ASS.When Someone grabs your underwear And Pulls Very High.

You need either a slave flash on the background, or a good reflectors to reflect the flash into the shadow areas. You will also need to ensure that all the lighting used has the same colour balance. Do not use fluorescent lighting with any other type of lighting as it will give a colour cast to the photographs.bit of kitchen foil stretch on some cardboard should give a gentler reflector and help cut down on shadows

It is Yahoo's attempt to break into the MySpace market. Other sites are out there that do the same thing: Friendster, Tease, etc.. However, they all focus on networking, making new friends, and communicating.i don't know, all i know is that you have to be over 18this is type of personal page or my space. this is all about sharing about interest, hobby, and interestiing things where you can invite your friend to views your myspace/ 360 ..... this help to express ourself to other or this is also a media for marketting.its like myspace..kinda dull boring myspace..

The function of saving "onscreen web pages" is actually delegated to your browser and operating system.  For this reason, it has nothing to do with your Yahoo! Mail account.. . If you continue to have problems saving web pages as HTML files on your computer, you may want to seek out assistance with your browser vendor.  Yahoo! cannot help you with this area.I do not understand want you are trying to say here. but what i know is that all your message are saved in your mailbox, like received massage are saved in the INBOX folder (unless you choose otherwise) and sent mails in the SENT folder (unless you choose otherwise)you can save it in your folderI have Save Sent Items folder turned on in my Yahoo mail.  Any email that I send, a copy is saved there for me.  Incoming, I have folders created to save messages into, Online bills, Important Email, Log In Stuff, etc.
depends if u no what there with if its yahoo,hotmail,wannadoo.tiscali. but id surgest if ur looking for someone then join the below sites they can helpGenerally, I would say just ask them, and if they didn't give it to you, they may not want you to have it. If you're looking for someone, I'm not sure how you would get their e-mail. Good luck in you search, though.
Sorry Chris, I've never heard of a read receipt.Yahoo! Mail does not offer a notification (receipt) when a recipient of your mail has reeived or reviewed the email.not sure what e-mail you are using. IF using outlook express, go to 'tools'  - options-  receipt anc check the 'request a read reciept ' box. good luck
Give it something to drink, play some romantic music and don't force yourself on it.  It may be its first time.u probly 4got ur passwordhave you got your 'caps' lock on?  Have you used the correct password?  You are trying to access it through Yahoo, aren't you?  Just checking...tell yahoo.try a different user name maybe they don't reconize your old one. or something is jammed. but if your yahoo thing didn't open then how could you write this question, it might be a glitch but don't be stressed.
You pay the difference which is not good as you also have moving expenses, a down payment on the next house, etc.  You can take out a loan to cover the difference but are then just adding onto your problem.some lenders may add/transfer to loan for new house...check with your mortage company.This is something that you should discuss with your agent.  If you owe more than it's worth you pay the difference.  Your agent will be able to help you with pricing your home so you may be able to make money.Simply ask for a price that will cover you.  Don't throw away any equity you have earned in the house either.  If you have to leave beforehand, assign an agent and instruct them on your conditions.  Give them a contact number if any questions too.

Because trolls are a superior life form, and the non-trolls simply cannot compete with them.  It is the way of nature, the strong survive and thrive, the weak perish.I don't know, but I wish they would get a life!  Except for that Sugarlovenugget chick.  She's peachy keen!They just doDon't know, but isn't it annoying.  Some really are looking for specific ANSWERS to real QUESTIONS.Trolls crave attention, and they care not whether it is positive or negative. They see the Internet as a mirror into which they can gaze in narcissistic rapture.I dont know but I get tired of them hitting on me and the toads too lmao
Don't know but you are now the third person who has asked in the last 10 minutes. I can't sign in either. Glitch in the system?Hey messenger finally signed me in so keep trying!well im glad your is working.  mine still isnt.  is anyone else's back up??Yea, it seems like a glitch in the system, or Yahoo is doing something to the servers. Be patient. It'll reconnect soon enough.. . Oh, and trying to connect multiple times might not be a good thing to do. It might get your IPs banned for too many connection attempts.i havent been able to get on either...so i guess we all have to be patient...must be systemthis hasn't happened to me before....hopefully it is just a glitch...don't know how long these things last...hey when someone gets on, tell the rest of us..okseriously i thought it was problem with my computerI thought it was just my computer.I can't sign in either. Yahoo must be having server problems.has everyone been able to sign in now? because i still can'tLast week, there were some intermittent login issues last that affected many of the Yahoo! Messenger users (and some Yahoo! Mail users). While it wasn’t an issue to login to Yahoo! Answers, as you can see that those affected by the login issue were able to come on here and ask questions, some Yahoo! sites/products were affected. This intermittent issue occured from June 20th - June 22nd.OK yahoo is up y_all good luck just got on...it won't let me sign on either! I thought it was my internet connection or something also but it's just not letting me sign on.Yeah I am having that problem too. It started about 30 minutes ago or so.. it has happened before and then gone away.i have been trying and trying and trying.. damn i have to go bed nowIf you can start up Yahoo and it won't connect, try going to "Messenger" then "Connection Preferences" when Yahoo starts up then change the connection setting from "No Proxies" to "Firewall With No Proxies".I am having the same problem here in Alaska.  I am glad it isn't just my computer

Did you even save it?you dont have an avatar
It might be your firewall (anti-spy or anti-Virus) locking everything out if your PC is left un-attended for a while.. Also you will be getting more "Traffic" through your PC.. Sorry if it's not the answer you were looking for!!someone may have slipped a cookie into your syestem? changeing your password my help.
delete her off ursWell If understand you correctly, you added your friend, and then your friend added you.   So if your friend added you, your friend can only remove you from their messenger.. . Did that answer your question?
I think waiting 24 hours to choose is kind of stupid because after about a couple of hours your question is so far down on the list that people don't even read them then.  I agree with yahoo in having to wait to choose a best answer....but definately NOT 24 hours!  I think you should wait about 5 hours.yep  I do . I agree with you >When this site first started, you didn't have to wait at all to choose a best answer. It was very annoying for many users because they'd be typing up an answer and then submit it only to find the question had already been resolved while they were typing.. . However, 24 hours does seem like more than enough time, especially since most answers come within the first couple of hours and a lot of askers don't bother coming back again after 24 hours to choose the best answer.. . Two hours still seems a little short for the time to keep a question open, but I can see twelve hours and possibly eight.. . The best place to suggest ideas like this, though, is in the Yahoo! Answers forum. There's a link in the upper right of this page. Other users can add their ideas there, and the team looks over everything for new ideas to implement. This has actually been brought up before, but it's been a while and may need to be brought up again.Yes im tired of waiting soo long to choose my best answer!!!!!!!!. If it was only 15 hours it would also do!!!!!!!!!!!to petty to think aboutsounds good to meSureyou dont have to pick best answer to get the info you needno kidding. it would be nice that's for sure. It's annoying cause I end up forgetting about it, and like today, I had to choose best answers for like 8 of my questions cause 24 hours...wow I can forget a lot in the amount of time lol
Well... I can see this one. I'd say your questions are showing up pretty well... :PIt takes time. U gotta wait for like half a minute before it actually appears. If u check like 5 minutes later, it wont show, cuz its gone from the first list. By the way, u can still check its progress from "My Q and A"IT HATES YOU!!!!!!!I'm sure that it does, I usually don't see mine either but what you gotta do is go to the My Q&A button then go to my questions, and if it is there then it means it has been posted.  Hope it helped!you dont have enuff points......questions cost 5pts...the more questions you answer the more points you acumulateno idea,I'm wondering why I am not even listed on the leader board (weekly or over all)! and I am not understanding how someone level 4 has 4,900 total points with only 488 total answers? Or a level 7 with 86,872 total points with 575 questions and only 5,204 total answers? Am I miss understanding the point system? while the points are worthless as far as using them,It is nice for them to show appreciation,but are there some that have figure out how to cheat the score keeper?Ummm...this one did.perhaps you aren't hitting the "submit" button.Have you looked on which category you chose your question inYour questions cannot possibly show up where the answers are. If they did, then your question would be the answer.It will after a few minutes :)Your question showed up today, so no need to worry.  =)this one didHow come I see this one!!!!this one did!! congrats!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Lol I know what you mean, like why dont they show upin the main page where you see everyone elses answers. I think you just cant see your own, because I never see mine either.. . Try clicking on categories and click Yahoo Products then Yahoo Answers, your question is there on my screenit just did dudethis planet is full of problems.everyone has their own queries and so ur problem is just lost in other's problems or queries!!have you looked under questions?
Good question-sometimes mine works and sometimes it doesn't. Hope someone knows the answer.because her computer suxmake sure you share avatar from your IM.She needs to click the button that looks like a little man in her upper right corner.
Well if you forget that you alot worse problems, than your scren name...Good luck with all that,    dont forget when its 420make yourself a new one that you can remember.if you are talking about your Yahoo screen name you can always find out by clicking on yahoo messenger after you connect to your internet service provider..in messenger it comes up showing your signining in listing your yahoo screen name in the sign-on window. :-)
on the homepage of the group you want to leave there's a section that says edit membership. click on it and then just click the button that says leave group. or you can leave it from your My Groups page by selecting 'leave group' in the appropriate columnsign in to that group at the top you'll see edit membership. @yahoo.com | Group Member  - Edit Membership  click on that link it'll take you to a link that you can change email addy your name at the bottom you'll see Save change; next to that reset next to that will be leave group after you click on leave group it'll take you to another link that will ask you are you sure click that then you'll see you have left group...peaceYou can do it by sending an email from your subscribed address to:  XXX-unsubscribe @ yahoogroups.com (close spaces). . Insert the exact group name in place of the XXX.. You don't have to type any message, it's automated.. . Good luck with your own group!
How do you know the account was actually deleted? It normally takes 3 months before all the data is deleted.. . So if you write to customer care, you may be able to reactivate. If it has been much longer then sorry.. Yahoo is obligated to remove all the data when a users asks for it.In sites like these, when its gone, its gone.
unless you're an expert hacker and you could delete it from the receivers computer there is no way to stop an email from being delivered once it has been sent. . . However if you mean pull up and look at the message you sent then all you have to do is go to the sent message folder of whatever email software you are using.If you want to recall an e.mail go to Sent and you will have the mail that u have sent. And if u dont get the mail then go to the settings and set it as the copy of mail sent. So, in this way u will get the copy of every mail sent.Yahoo! Mail doesn't have support for this. It's not required that email vendors support message recall, either. So even if Yahoo! did implement it, there's no guarantee that you would be able to recall a message if it was sent to a system that didn't support message recall.click on sent messages.You just click "sent"You don't. Once Yahoo sends it, it's gone.The only service that can do that is AOL.  Click unsend.By recall do you mean cancel? Or do you mean get it back so you can look at it?. You can go into your sent messages to review. I am not sure if you can cancel it or not.Make sure you have ( save a copy of my sent e-mail) marked. . Go to options, and sent your mail account up as desired...
It's ridiculous!  My favorite is when someone asks a question about a specific area like, what restaurants should they go to in New York, and someone answers: "I don't know, I've never been to New York."  Great moron, then don't answer!for the points mostly,but it depends on the question quite often-you get a meaningless answer on the meaningless question.Because people are dumb by nature.For the pointswhy do people ask questions when they have no idea what they are askingbecause they have nothing better to dojust because. some of us are have-a-go-heroes. and want to try help everyonethey think they know what they are talking about or they just answer for the pointswhy whole the people said like these answer???. . beacause no bady knows the function from this question!!!!Because we are all bored and have sad little pathetic lives. Think about it, why did you waste a minute of YOUR life, (that now you can never get back) asking why people answer questions that we know nothing about. Why am I wasting my time answering this question right now? I will not benefit in any way and neither will you. Frankly I have nothing better to do with my time. None of us do, that's why were on some lame site scrolling through strangers questions, most of whom want to know if we think they are fat!just to get the points ...99% people answer only if they can understand the question and if it is easy. It is a different issue if the questioner likes that answer or not? So many complicated and technical questions even a dumb will think twice before answering.B/C everyone knows a little bit about something and a whole lot about nothing.for the points . hello!For the 2 pointswell they try to answer the question.. least i know i do.. the questions are not always easy to understand either..but it does help trying to get the 2 points, i will admit that..but if i do not know what i am talking about i am glad to say it....hope this answers at least my view point..on the whole you have to admit questions and answers on yahoo is interesting...but i guess you may run into just jokers or whatever they are on here too..but i hope you have better experiences in the future...For the points.  And maybe they do know what they are talking about maybe you just don't understand what they are trying to say!for the points....I have had people call me names,,,,,,,,,and they did not read what I even typedBecause for some reason they just want those 2 points on Yahoo! Answers so badly that they will say any idiotic thing that comes into their head to get the 2 points.  Either that or A: they are extremely bored or B: they like messing with people.Because they think they know everything.yes.. its the points.. but jeez.... its not like points are money or gold... If I don't know the answer /not interested in the question / or  can't at  least give a witty answer... I pass it up... whats the point?  2 ... big deal...lol...Some do it for the points more to the fact they really think they know the answer better.. . Take for example American Idol look at them people on there try out Whoo! do that get mad.. . But ever year appox 40,000 people will try out. . So i really think some think they are right.Because in addition to being a wonderful source of information and opinions, Yahoo! Answers is also an underground humor operation.  That's why I'm in it, anyway.  Points don't enter into it!PointsJust to get the points.... and sometimes to be annoying
You might want to click this link, I've answered a question similar to yours previously: http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Al40ovG9BN9TDGHBuoXsizPsy6IX?qid=20060626112218AAFFfP5. . Good luck!I believe that when you remove them from yours, you will be removed from theirs.  Go to 360 -> my friends -> edit and there is a 'remove' link there.
